        "content": "Imagine a blue-green ribbon of water some 60 yards wide, then rough sandy dunes 10 or 20 feet high, and then beyond, the desert, burning yellow in the sun—here and there partly covered with scrub, but for the most part seeming quite bare; sometimes flat and stony, sometimes tossed and broken, sometimes in great drifts and wreaths of sand, just like snowdrifts, delicately ribbed by the wind—the whole stretching away for miles, scores of miles, not a moving form visible, till it is bounded on the horizon by a ridge of hills of the most ethereal pink under an intense blue sky. Such is the view to the east of us now, as we pass through the Suez Canal (19th October, 1890). To the west the land looks browner and grayer; some reeds mark a watercourse, and about 10 miles off appears a frowning dark range of bare hills about 2,000 feet high, an outlying spur of the hills (Jebel Attákah) that bound the Gulf of Suez. In such a landscape one of the signal stations, with its neat tiled cottage and flagstaff, and a few date palms and perhaps a tiny bit of garden, is quite an attraction to the eye. These stations are placed at intervals of about 6 miles all along the canal. They serve to regulate the traffic, which is now enormous, and continuous night and day. The great ships nearly fill the waterway, so that one has to be drawn aside and moored in order to let another pass; and though they are not allowed to go faster than 4 miles an hour they create a considerable wave in their rear, which keeps washing down the banks. Tufts of a reedy grass have been planted in places to hold the sand together; but the silt is very great, and huge steam-dredges are constantly at work to remove it. Here and there on the bank is a native hut of dry reeds—three sides and a flat top—just a shelter from the sun; or an Arab tent, with camels tethered by the leg around it. At Kantarah the caravan track from Jerusalem—one of the great highways of the old world—crosses the canal; there are a few wood and mud huts, and it is curious to see the string of laden camels and the Arabs in their unbleached cotton burnouses coming down—just as they might be coming down from the time of Father Abraham—and crossing the path of this huge modern steamship, with its electric lights and myriad modern appliances, the Kaiser Wilhelm now going half-way round the globe. The desert does not seem quite devoid of animal life; at any rate along the canal side you may see tracks in the sand of rabbits and hares, occasional wagtail-like birds by the water, a few crows hovering above, or a sea-gull, not to mention camels and a donkey or two, or a goat. Near Port Said they say the lagoons are sometimes white with flocks of pelicans and flamingoes, but we passed there in the night. It was fine to see the electric light, placed in the bows, throwing a clear beam and illuminating the banks for fully half a mile ahead, as we slowly steamed along. The driven sand looked like snow in the bluish light. The crescent moon and Venus were in the sky, and the red signal lights behind us of Port Said. The canal is 90 miles long, and a large part of it follows the bed of a very ancient canal which is supposed to have connected the two seas. It appears that there is a very slight movement of the water through it from south to north. We are now nearing Suez, and the heat is so great that it reverberates from the banks as from a furnace; of course the deck is under an awning. The remains of a little village built of clay appears, but the huts have broken down, split by the fierce sun-rays, and some light frame-houses, roofed and walled with shingles, have taken their place. Gulf of Suez.—The town of Suez is a tumbledown little place, narrow lanes and alleys; two-storied stone houses mostly, some with carved wooden fronts, and on the upper floors lattice-work, behind which I suppose the women abide. Some nice-looking faces in the streets, but a good many ruffians; not so bad though as Port Said, where the people simply exist to shark upon the ships. In both places an insane medley of Arabs, fellahs, half-castes and Europeans, touts, guides, donkey-boys, etc., and every hade of dress and absurd hybrid costume, from extreme Oriental to correct English; ludicrous scenes of passengers going on shore, ladies clinging round the necks of swarthy boatmen; donkey-boys shouting the names of their donkeys—“Mr. Bradlaugh, sir, very fine donkey,” “Mrs. Langtry,” “Bishop of London,” etc.; fearful altercations about claimed baksheesh; parties beguiled into outlying quarters of the town and badly blackmailed; refusals of boatmen to take you back to the ship while the very gong of departure is sounding; and so forth. Suez however has a little caravan and coasting trade of its own, besides the railway which now runs thence to Cairo, and has antique claims to a respectability which its sister city at the other end of the canal cannot share.",
        "target_summary": "On October 19, 1890, the view to the east from the Suez Canal presented a 60-yard-wide blue-green waterway, followed by rough sandy dunes 10 to 20 feet high. Beyond lay a vast, burning yellow desert, mostly bare but varying from flat and stony to broken ground and great, wind-ribbed sand drifts resembling snow. This expanse stretched for scores of miles to distant ethereal pink hills under an intense blue sky. To the west, the land appeared browner and grayer, with reeds marking a watercourse, and about 10 miles away, a dark, frowning range of bare hills, an outlying spur of Jebel Attákah (~2,000 ft).\n\nSignal stations, with their neat tiled cottages, flagstaffs, date palms, and small gardens, served as welcome attractions, placed every six miles to regulate the enormous, continuous ship traffic. The great ships nearly filled the waterway, necessitating one to moor aside for another to pass. Despite a 4 mph speed limit, they created considerable waves that eroded the banks, leading to the planting of reedy grass to hold the sand and constant work by huge steam-dredges to remove vast amounts of silt. Native huts of dry reeds (three-sided with flat tops) and Arab tents with tethered camels dotted the banks. Animal life, though sparse, included tracks of rabbits and hares, occasional wagtail-like birds, crows, and seagulls, alongside camels and donkeys.\n\nAt Kantarah, the ancient caravan track from Jerusalem—one of the old world's great highways—crossed the canal, a site of striking contrast. Here, traditional Arabs in unbleached cotton burnouses, leading laden camels, met a huge, modern steamship like the Kaiser Wilhelm, with its electric lights and myriad appliances, on its global journey, near a few wood and mud huts. Traveling at night, the ship's bow-mounted electric light cast a clear beam illuminating the banks for half a mile, making the driven sand appear like snow in the bluish glow, under a sky holding the crescent moon, Venus, and Port Said's red signal lights behind them.\n\nThe 90-mile canal largely follows the bed of a very ancient waterway believed to have connected the two seas, exhibiting a slight south-to-north water movement. Nearing Suez, the intense heat reverberated from the banks \"as from a furnace.\" Here, the remains of an old clay village, its huts broken by fierce sun-rays, were being replaced by lighter frame-houses with shingled roofs and walls.\n\nThe town of Suez itself was a \"tumbledown\" place of narrow lanes and alleys, mostly two-storied stone houses, some with carved wooden fronts and upper-floor latticework, behind which women presumably resided. The streets contained a mix of pleasant faces and many ruffians. Both Suez and Port Said were described as a \"medley\" of Arabs, fellahs, half-castes, and Europeans, including touts, guides, and donkey-boys, displaying every imaginable dress and hybrid costume. Ludicrous scenes unfolded as passengers went ashore: ladies clinging to swarthy boatmen, donkey-boys humorously shouting names like \"Mr. Bradlaugh\" or \"Mrs. Langtry\" for their animals, fearful altercations over baksheesh, and parties lured into outlying quarters to be blackmailed, with boatmen sometimes refusing return to ships even as departure gongs sounded. Suez, however, maintained a little caravan and coasting trade, a railway to Cairo, and \"antique claims to a respectability\" that Port Said, where people simply \"shark upon the ships,\" could not share.",

        "content": "Now that we are out in the gulf, the sea is deep blue, and very beautiful, the rocks and mountains along the shore very wild and bare, and in many parts of a strong red color. This arm of the Red Sea is about 150 miles long, and I think not more than 20 miles wide at any point; in some places it is much less. We pass jutting capes and islands quite close on the west of us—great rocky ravine-cut masses absolutely bare of vegetation. On the east—apparently about 10 miles distant, but very clear—stands an outlying range of Sinai—Jebel Sirbal by name—looks about 5,000 or 6,000 feet high, very wild and craggy, many of the peaks cloven at the summit and gaping as if with the heat; farther back some higher points are visible, one of which is probably Jebel Musa. A most extraordinary land; at some places one can discern—especially with the aid of a glass—large tracts or9 plains of loose sand, miles in extent, and perfectly level, except where they wash up in great drifts against the bases of the mountains. Across these plains tall dark columns can be distinguished slowly traveling—the dreaded sand-clouds borne on eddies of the wind. Indian Ocean, Oct. 25th.—Much cooler now. In the Red Sea, with thermometer at 90° in the cabins, heat was of course the absorbing topic. Everybody mopping; punkahs in full swing. I believe the water there frequently reaches 90° F., and sometimes 95°; but here it is quite cool, probably not much over 60°, and that alone makes a great difference. It is a queer climate in the Red Sea: there seems to be always a haze, due to dust blown from the shores; at the same time the air is very damp, owing to the enormous evaporation, clothes hung up get quite wet, and there are heavy dews. When the wind is aft the oppression from the heat is sometimes so great that ships have to be turned back and steamed against the breeze; but even so casualties and deaths are not uncommon. Owing to the haze, and the breadth of the Red Sea which is as much as 200 miles in parts, little is seen of the shores. A few rocky islands are passed, and a good many awkward reefs which the passengers know nothing of. The Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb are curious. The passage between the Island of Perim and the Arabian mainland is quite narrow, only a mile or two wide; tossed wild-looking hills on the mainland, 3,000 or 4,000 feet high, with French fortifications. The island itself lower and more rounded, with English fort and lighthouse; but looking very black and bare, though owing to the moisture there is some kind of stunted heathery stuff growing on it. There are a few English here, and a native town of waggon-like tents clustered round the fort; some little fishing and sailing boats along the shores. Turning eastwards along the south coast of Arabia the same awful land meets the eye as in the Gulf of Suez. A continual cloud of dust flies along it, through which one discerns sandy plains, and high parched summits beyond. There must however be water in some parts of this region, as it is back from here in this angle of Arabia that Mocha lies and the coffee is grown. Colombo.—I fear that the Red Sea combined with mutual boredom had a bad effect on the passengers’ tempers, for terrible dissensions broke out; and after six days of the Indian Ocean, during which the only diversions were flying-fish outside and scandal-mongering inside the ship, it was a relief to land on the palm-fringed coast of Ceylon. The slender catamarans—or more properly outrigged canoes—manned by dusky forms, which come to take you ashore, are indeed so narrow that it is impossible to sit inside them! They are made of a “dug-out” tree-trunk (see frontispiece), with parallel bulwarks fastened on only 10 inches or a foot apart; across the bulwarks a short board is placed, and on that you can sit. Two arms projecting on one side carry a float or light fish-shaped piece of wood, which rests on the water 8 feet or so from the canoe, and prevents the vessel from capsizing, which it would otherwise infallibly do. Impelled by oars, or by a sail, the boat bounds over the water at a good speed; and the mode of traveling is very pleasant. There is no necessity however to embark in these frail craft, for respectable civilised boats, and even steam-launches, abound; we are indeed in an important and busy port. A great granite mole, built five years ago, has converted an open roadstead into a safe and capacious harbor, and there is now probably no place in the East better supplied with mails and passenger boats than Colombo. It is the calling place for the great lines of steamers en route for Australia, for China and Japan, and for Calcutta and Burmah, not to mention smaller coasting boats from the mainland of India, and so forth. The city itself has only the slightest resemblance to a European town. There is a fort certainly, and a Government House, and barracks with a regiment of infantry (part of whom however are generally up country); there are two or three streets of two or even three-storied houses, with shops, banks, mercantile offices, etc.; a few hotels and big goods stores, a lighthouse, and a large engineering works, employing some hundreds of Cinghalese and Tamil operatives; and then you have done with the English quarter. The land is flat, and round about the part just described stretch open grass-covered spaces, and tree-fringed roads, with the tiny booths or huts of the darkies on both sides of them. Here and there are knots and congeries of little streets and native markets with multifarious life going on in them. Here is a street of better built cottages or little villas belonging to Eurasians—the somewhat mixed descendants of old Dutch and Portuguese settlers—small one or seldom two-storied houses of stuccoed brick, with a verandah in front and a little open court within, clustering round an old Dutch church of the 17th century. Here is the residential quarter of the official English and of the more aspiring among the natives—the old Cinnamon Gardens, now laid out in large villa-bungalows and private grounds. Here again is a Roman Catholic church and convent, or the grotesque façade of a Hindu temple; and everywhere trees and flowering shrubs and, as one approaches the outskirts of the town, the plentiful broad leaves of coco-palms and bananas overshadowing the roads. Nor in any description of Colombo should the fresh-water lake be forgotten, which ramifying and winding in most intricate fashion through the town, and in one place coming within a hundred yards of the sea, surprises one continually with enchanting glimpses. I don’t know any more delightful view of its kind—all the more delightful because so unexpected—than that which greets the eye on entering the Fort Railway Station at Colombo. You pass through the booking-office and find yourself on a platform, which except for the line of rails between might be a terrace on the lake itself; a large expanse of water with wooded shores and islands, interspersed with villas, cottages and cabins, lies before you; white-sailed boats are going to and fro; groups of dark figures, waist-deep in water, are washing clothes; children are playing and swimming in the water; and when, as I saw it once, the evening sun is shining through the transparent green fringe of banana palms which occupies the immediate foreground, and the calm lake beyond reflects like a mirror the gorgeous hues of sky and cloud, the scene is one which for effects of color can hardly be surpassed.",
        "target_summary": "The journey commenced in the deep blue, beautiful Gulf of Suez, where wild, bare, red rocky shores and mountains lined the 150-mile-long arm of the Red Sea, which rarely exceeded 20 miles in width. To the west, jutting capes and barren, ravine-cut islands appeared. Eastward, the wild and craggy Sinai range, including Jebel Sirbal (5-6k ft) and higher points like Jebel Musa, showed peaks seemingly cloven by heat. The extraordinary landscape featured vast, level sandy plains, miles in extent, with sand drifts against mountains, and \"dreaded sand-clouds\" forming as dark, traveling columns.\n\nConditions in the Red Sea were intensely hot, with cabin temperatures consistently 90°F and water often 90-95°F, a stark contrast to the cooler 60°F water later encountered in the Indian Ocean. The climate was peculiar: a constant haze from shore dust combined with high humidity, leading to heavy dews and damp clothes. Extreme heat sometimes necessitated turning ships back against the wind, yet casualties and deaths were still common. Due to the haze and the sea's breadth (up to 200 miles in parts), shores were seldom visible, though rocky islands and dangerous reefs were passed.\n\nThe Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, a narrow passage only a mile or two wide, separated Perim Island from the Arabian mainland. The mainland featured wild, 3-4k ft hills with French fortifications. Perim Island, lower and more rounded, hosted an English fort, lighthouse, and a small native town of tents, despite its bare, black appearance, which supported some stunted heathery growth due to moisture. Eastward along the Arabian coast, the land remained harsh, characterized by a perpetual dust cloud, sandy plains, and parched summits, though the presence of Mocha indicated water sources in some areas.\n\nThe oppressive Red Sea conditions, combined with mutual boredom, led to significant passenger dissensions. After six days in the Indian Ocean, where flying-fish and shipboard gossip provided the only diversions, landing on Ceylon's palm-fringed coast at Colombo was a welcome relief.\n\nArrival in Colombo involved transfer ashore via slender outrigged canoes, or \"catamarans,\" manned by locals. These unique vessels, made from dug-out tree-trunks with narrow bulwarks (10-12 inches apart) and a seating board, were stabilized by an outrigger float, preventing them from capsizing. They offered a swift and pleasant ride, though conventional boats and steam-launches were also readily available in this bustling port.\n\nColombo's port was significant; a five-year-old granite mole had transformed an open roadstead into a safe, capacious harbor, making it the best-supplied in the East for mail and passenger steamers. It served as a crucial hub for lines connecting to Australia, China, Japan, Calcutta, and Burma. The city itself had only a slight resemblance to a European town.\n\nThe English quarter comprised a fort, Government House, barracks, a few streets of multi-story European-style buildings (shops, banks, offices, hotels), a lighthouse, and a large engineering works employing Cinghalese and Tamil operatives. Beyond this, the landscape opened to grass-covered spaces and tree-lined roads dotted with native huts and bustling local markets. A Eurasian quarter featured stuccoed brick villas, often 1-2 stories with verandahs, clustered around a 17th-century Dutch church. The official English and aspiring natives resided in the former Cinnamon Gardens, now laid out with large villa-bungalows. Religious structures included Roman Catholic churches and Hindu temples. The city was lush with trees, flowering shrubs, and, towards the outskirts, abundant coco-palms and bananas.\n\nA prominent feature was the winding freshwater lake, intricately woven through the city and, at one point, within a hundred yards of the sea. Entering the Fort Railway Station offered a particularly enchanting and unexpected view: the platform overlooked the expansive lake, with wooded shores, islands, and scattered villas. White-sailed boats traversed the water, locals washed clothes, and children played. In the evening sun, reflecting the sky's vibrant hues through the foreground of banana palms, the scene presented an unparalleled display of color.",

        "content": "Up and down these streets and roads, and by the side of this lake, and along the seashore and through the quays and docks, goes, as may be imagined, a most motley crowd. The Cinghalese and the Tamils are of course the most numerous, but besides these there are Mahomedans—usually called Moor-men here—and some Malays. The English in Ceylon may be divided into three classes: the official English, the planters, and the small trading English (including employees on railway and other works). Then there are the anglicised native gentry, Cinghalese or Tamil, some of whom occupy official positions, and who largely adopt European dress and habits; the non-anglicised ditto, who keep to their own ways and costume, and are not much seen in public; the Dutch Eurasians, many of whom become doctors or solicitors (proctors); and the Portuguese, who are frequently traders in a small way. Specimens of all these, in their different degrees of costume and absence of costume, may be seen in Colombo, as indeed in almost any place in Ceylon which can be dignified with the name of a town. Here for instance is a great big Moor-man with high fez of plaited grass, baggy white pants and turned-up shoes; a figured vest on his body, and red shawl thrown over one shoulder. [He is probably a well-to-do shopkeeper; not an agreeable face, but I find the Mahomedans have a good reputation for upright dealing and fidelity to their word.] Here a ruddy-brown Cinghalese man, with hairy chest, and nothing on but a red loin-cloth, carrying by a string an earthenware pot, probably of palm-beer. [A peasant. The Cinghalese are generally of this color, whereas the Tamils tend towards black, though shading off in the higher castes to an olive tint.] Another Cinghalese, dressed all in white, white cotton jacket and white cloth hanging to below the knees, with elegant semicircular tortoise-shell comb on his head; a morbidly sensitive face with its indrawn nose and pouting lips. [Possibly a private servant, or small official of one of the courts, or Arachchi. The comb is a great mark of the low-country Cinghalese. They draw the hair backwards over the head and put the comb on horizontally, like an incomplete crown, with its two ends sticking15 up above the forehead—very like horns from a front view! The hair is then fastened in a knot behind, or sometimes left hanging down the back. This is a somewhat feeble face, but as a rule one may say that the Cinghalese are very intelligent. They make excellent carpenters and mechanics. Are generally sensitive and proud.] Here come two Englishmen in tweed suits and tennis shoes—their umbrellas held carefully by the middle—apparently of the planter community, young, but rather weedy looking, with an unsteady, swimmy look about the eyes which I fear is not uncommon among the planters; I have seen it already well-developed in a mere boy of eighteen. Here a dozen or so of chetties (a Tamil commercial16 caste), with bare shaven and half-shaven heads, brown skins, and white muslins thrown gracefully round their full and sleek limbs; the sacred spot marked on their foreheads, red betel in their mouths, and avarice in their faces. There a Tamil coolie or wage-worker, nearly naked except for a handkerchief tied round his head, with glossy black skin and slight yet graceful figure. Here a pretty little girl of nine or so, with blue beads round her neck, and the usual white cotton jacket and colored petticoat or çilai of the Cinghalese women, walking with a younger brother. Here three young Eurasian girls in light European costume and straw hats, hair loose or in pigtails down their backs, very pretty. [They are off for a walk along the Galle Face promenade by the sea, as the heat of the day is now past.] Here also an English lady, young and carefully dressed, but looking a little bored, driving in her pony-trap to do some shopping, with a black boy standing behind and holding a sunshade over her.",

        "content": "One of the features of Colombo are the jinrickshaws, or light two-wheeled gigs drawn by men, which abound in the streets. These Tamil fellows, in the lightest of costumes, their backs streaming under the vertical sun, bare-legged and often bare-headed, will trot with you in a miraculous way from one end of Colombo to the other, and for the smallest fee. Tommy Atkins delights to sit thus lordly behind the toiling “nigger.” At eventide you may see him and his Eurasian girl—he in one jinrickshaw and she in another—driving out to the Galle Face Hotel, or some such distant resort along17 the shore of the many-sounding ocean. The Tamils are mostly slight and graceful in figure, and of an active build. Down at the docks they work by hundreds, with nothing on beyond a narrow band between the thighs, loading and unloading barges and ships—a study of the human figure. Some of them of course are thick and muscular, but mostly they excel in a kind of unconscious grace and fleetness of form as of the bronze Mercury of Herculaneum, of which they often remind me. Their physiognomy corresponds with their bodily activity; the most characteristic type that I have noticed among them has level brows, and eyes deep-set (and sometimes a little close together), straight nose, and well-formed chin. They are a more enterprising pushing and industrious people than the Cinghalese, eager and thin, skins often very dark,18 with a concentrated, sometimes demonish, look between the eyes—will-power evidently present—but often handsome. Altogether a singular mixture of enterprise with demonic qualities; for occultism is rife among them, from the jugglery of the lower castes to the esoteric philosophy and speculativeness of the higher. The horse-keepers and stable boys in Ceylon are almost all Tamils (of a low caste), and are a charming race, dusky active affectionate demons, fond of their horses, and with unlimited capacity of running, even over newly macadamised roads. The tea-coolies are also Tamils, and the road-workers, and generally all wage-laborers; while the Cinghalese, who have been longer located in the island, keep to their own little peasant holdings and are not at all inclined to come under the thumb of a master, preferring often indeed to suffer a chronic starvation instead. The Tamil women are, like their lords, generally of a slighter build than the Cinghalese of the same sex, some indeed are quite diminutive. Among both races some very graceful and good-looking girls are to be seen, up to the age of sixteen or so, fairly bright even in manner; especially among the Cinghalese are they distinguished for their fine eyes; but at a later age, and as wives, they lose their good looks and tend to become rather heavy and brutish. The contrast between the Cinghalese and the Tamils is sufficiently marked throughout, and though they live on the island on amicable terms there is as a rule no love lost between them. The Cinghalese came to Ceylon, apparently from the19 mainland of India, somewhere in the 6th century B.C., and after pushing the aborigines up into the woods and mountains (where some of them may yet be found), occupied the whole island. It was not long however before the Tamils followed, also from India; and since then, and through a long series of conflicts, the latter have maintained their position, and now form the larger part of the population in the north of the island, while the Cinghalese are most numerous in the south. Great numbers of Tamil peasants—men, women, and children—still come over from the mainland every year, and go up-country to work in the tea-gardens, where there is a great demand for coolie labour. In character the Cinghalese are more like the20 Italians, easy-going, reasonably idle, sensitive, shrewd, and just a bit romantic. Their large eyes and tortoise-shell combs and long hair give them a very womanly aspect; and many of the boys and youths have very girlish features and expressions. They have nearly always grace and dignity of manner, the better types decidedly handsome, with their well-formed large heads, short beards, and long black hair, composed and gentle, remindful of some pictures of Christ. In inferior types you have thick-featured, morbidly sensitive, and at the same time dull-looking persons. As a rule their frames are bigger and more fleshy than those of the Tamils, and their features less cleanly cut. Captain R. Knox, in his “Nineteen Years’ Captivity in the Kingdom of Conde Uda” (1681), says of them:—“In carriage and behaviour they are very grave and stately, like unto Portuguese; in understanding quick and apprehensive; in design, subtle and crafty; in discourse, courteous, but full of flatteries; naturally inclined to temperance both in meat and drink, but not to chastity; near and provident in their families, commending good husbandry.”",
        "target_summary": "Colombo's streets are notable for jinrickshaws, two-wheeled gigs drawn by lightly clad Tamil men who efficiently traverse the city for minimal fees, often for British soldiers and their companions. These Tamils are typically slight, graceful, and active, displaying an \"unconscious grace\" likened to a bronze Mercury, especially when working with minimal clothing at the docks. Their common physiognomy features level brows, deep-set eyes, a straight nose, and a well-formed chin.\n\nTamils are characterized as an enterprising, industrious, eager, thin, and often dark-skinned people, frequently handsome, with a concentrated, sometimes \"demonic\" look signifying strong will-power. This enterprising nature is combined with \"demonic qualities\" due to widespread occultism. They predominantly serve as wage-laborers, including horse-keepers (described as \"charming, dusky, active affectionate demons\"), stable boys, tea-coolies, and road-workers. In contrast, the Cinghalese, long-term residents, prefer maintaining their own peasant holdings over wage labor, even to the point of enduring chronic starvation. Tamil women are generally slighter than Cinghalese women. While both groups produce graceful, attractive girls up to about sixteen (Cinghalese particularly noted for their fine eyes), they tend to become heavier and less comely as wives.\n\nDespite living amicably, a distinct contrast exists between the Cinghalese and Tamils, with \"no love lost\" between them. The Cinghalese arrived from mainland India around the 6th century B.C., occupying the island after displacing its aboriginal inhabitants. Tamils subsequently followed from India, establishing their presence through a history of conflicts. Tamils now form the majority in the island's north, while Cinghalese are most numerous in the south. Many Tamil peasants still migrate annually from the mainland to work in the tea-gardens.\n\nThe Cinghalese character is likened to Italians: easy-going, somewhat idle, sensitive, shrewd, and romantic. Their appearance, with large eyes, long hair, and sometimes girlish features in boys, gives them a \"womanly aspect.\" They possess grace and dignity, with the better types being handsome, composed, and gentle; inferior types are thick-featured and morbidly sensitive. Physically, Cinghalese are generally larger and fleshier than Tamils, with less sharply defined features. As observed by Captain R. Knox in 1681, they are grave, stately, quick-witted, subtle, crafty, courteous but flattering, temperate in diet but not chastity, and provident.",

The Tamils have a quite extensive literature of considerable antiquity, mostly philosophical or philosophical poetical; and their language is very rich in vocabulary as well as in its grammatical forms and inflexions—though very terse, with scanty terms21 of courtesy (“thank you,” “good-morning,” and such like), and a little harsh in sound, k’s and r’s flying through the teeth at a great rate. Cinghalese is much more liquid and pleasant in sound, and has many more Aryan words in it. In fact it is supposed to be an offshoot of Sanskrit, whereas Tamil seems to have no relation to Sanskrit, except that it has borrowed a good many words. The curious thing is that, so little related as races, the Tamils should have taken their philosophy, as they have done, from the Sanskrit Vedas and Upanishads, and really expressed the ideas if anything more compactly and systematically than the Sanskrit books do. Though poor in literature I believe, yet the Cinghalese has one of the best books of chronicles which exist in any language—the Mahawanso—giving a very reliable history of the race (of course with florid adornment of stupendous miracles, which can easily be stripped off) from their landing in Ceylon down to modern times. The Mahawanso was begun by Mahanamo, a priest, who about 460 A.D. compiled the early portion comprising the period from B.C. 543 to A.D. 301, after which it was continued by successive authors right down to British times, i.e., A.D. 1758! There are two newspapers in Colombo printed in the Cinghalese language, one of which is called The Buddhist World; there is also a paper printed in Tamil; and there are three English newspapers. In “places of entertainment” Colombo (and the same is true of the towns in India) is very wanting. There is no theatre or concert-hall. It can be readily understood that though the population22 is large (120,000), it is so diverse that a sufficiently large public cannot be found to support such places. The native races have each their own festivals, which provide for them all they require in that way. The British are only few—5,000 in all Ceylon, including military, out of a population of over three millions; and even if the Eurasian population—who of course go in for Western manners and ideals—were added, their combined numbers would be only scanty. An occasional circus or menagerie, or a visit from a stray theatrical company on its way to Australia, is all that takes place in that line. For the rest there is a Salvation Army, with thriving barracks, a Theosophist Society, a branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and various other little clubs representing different sections. Society is of course very much broken up into sections. Even the British, few as they are, are sadly divided by cliques and jealousies; the line between the official English and the “second-class” English is terribly severe (as indeed all over India); and between these again and the Eurasians. Even where Cinghalese or Tamil or Eurasian families of old standing attain important official positions, an insuperable stiffness still marks the intercourse between them and the British. “Ah!” said a planter to a young friend of mine who had just shaken hands rather cordially with a native gentleman, “Ah! my boy, you won’t do that when you’ve been here three years!” Thus a perfect social amalgamation and the sweetness of brethren dwelling together in unity are things still rather far distant in this otherwise lovely isle. Talking about the beauty of the island, I was very much struck, even on my first landing, with its “spicy gales.” The air is heavy with an aromatic fragrance which, though it forced itself on my attention for three or four weeks before I got fairly accustomed to it, I have never been able to trace to any particular plant or shrub. It is perhaps not unlike the odor of the cinnamon leaf when bruised, but I don’t think it comes from that source. I am never tired of looking at the coco-nut palms; they grow literally by the million all along this coast to the north and south of Colombo. To the south the sea-shore road is overshadowed by them. I have been some miles along the road, and the belt of land, a hundred yards or so wide, between it and the sea, is thick with their stems right down to the water’s edge, over which they lean lovingly, for they are fond of the salt spray. On the other side of the road too they grow, and underneath them are little villas and farmsteads and tiny native cabins, with poultry and donkeys and humped cows and black pigs and brown children, in lively confusion; while groups of peasant men and women in bright-colored wraps travel slowly along, and the little bullock gigs, drawn by active little brahmin bulls with jingling bells, trot past at a pace which would do credit to an English pony—a scene which they say continues much the same the whole way to Galle (80 miles). These palms do not grow wild in Ceylon; they are all planted and cared for, whether in huge estates, or in the rood of ground which surrounds a Cinghalese cabin. The Cinghalese have a pretty saying that they cannot grow afar from the sound of24 the human voice. They have also a saying to the effect that a man only sees a straight coco-palm once in a lifetime. Many of the other kinds of palms grow remarkably straight, but this kind certainly does not. In a grove of them you see hundreds of the grey smooth stems shooting upwards in every fantastic curve imaginable, with an extraordinary sense of life and power, reminding one of the way in which a volley of rockets goes up into the air. Then at the height of 50 or 60 feet they break into that splendid crown of green plumes which sparkles glossy in the sun, and waves and whispers to the lightest breeze. Along this palm-fringed and mostly low and sandy shore the waves break—with not much change of level in their tides—loudly roaring in the S.W. monsoon, or with sullen swell when the wind is in the N.E., but seldom altogether calm. A grateful breeze tempers the 90° of the thermometer. A clumsy-hulled lateen-sailed fishing boat is anchored in the shelter of a sandy spit; two or three native men and boys are fishing with rod and line, standing ankle-deep at the water’s edge. The dashing blue waves look tempting for a bathe, but the shore is comparatively deserted; not a soul is to be seen in the water, infested as it is by the all-dreaded shark. Only, 300 or 400 yards out, can be discerned the figure of a man—also fishing with a line—apparently standing up to his middle in water, but really sitting on a kind of primitive raft or boat, consisting of three or four logs of wood, slightly shaped, with upturned ends, and loosely tied together—the true catamaran (kattu maram, tied25 tree). The water of course washes up and around him, but that is pleasant on a hot day. He is safe from sharks; there is a slender possibility of his catching something for dinner; and there he sits, a relic of pre-Adamite times, while the train from Kalutara rushes by with a shriek to Colombo.",
        "target_summary": "Ceylon's population is largely Cinghalese Buddhists, with Buddhism introduced around the 4th century B.C., and Tamil Hindus. Tamils possess an extensive, ancient philosophical literature, and their language is rich in vocabulary and grammar, though terse and somewhat harsh in sound. Cinghalese, in contrast, is more liquid, pleasant, and contains many Aryan words, believed to be an offshoot of Sanskrit, unlike Tamil which merely borrowed from it. Interestingly, Tamils derived their philosophy from Sanskrit Vedas and Upanishads, expressing ideas even more compactly than the original texts. While Cinghalese literature is generally sparse, it includes the Mahawanso, an exceptionally reliable historical chronicle of the race, detailing events from 543 B.C. to 1758 A.D., albeit with miraculous embellishments. This work was initiated by priest Mahanamo around 460 A.D.\n\nColombo has newspapers in Cinghalese (like The Buddhist World), Tamil, and English. The city, despite a population of 120,000, lacks Western-style entertainment venues such as theatres or concert halls. This is attributed to its diverse populace and the small British community (5,000 in all Ceylon), which together cannot generate sufficient public support; native festivals satisfy the local demand for entertainment. Society is severely fragmented, marked by deep social divisions. Even the limited British community suffers from cliques and jealousies, with a stark separation between officials and \"second-class\" English, and further divisions from Eurasians and established native families in high positions. A true social amalgamation remains distant.\n\nThe island's beauty is striking, characterized by persistent \"spicy gales\"—a heavy aromatic fragrance. Millions of cultivated coconut palms line the coast north and south of Colombo, forming a wide belt right to the water's edge, leaning \"lovingly\" towards the salt spray. These palms, always cared for, are distinctive for their fantastically curved, smooth grey stems rising 50-60 feet before crowning in splendid green plumes. Below them, villas, farmsteads, and native cabins create lively scenes with animals and families.\n\nThe palm-fringed, low, and sandy shore experiences roaring waves during the S.W. monsoon or sullen swells otherwise, tempered by a constant breeze. Despite the inviting blue waters, the shore is largely deserted due to the omnipresent threat of sharks. Fishermen venture out in clumsy-hulled boats or, further offshore, on primitive catamarans (tied logs), ensuring their safety from sharks while patiently fishing.",

        "content": "Ernst Haeckel in his book about Ceylon says that the Cinghalese, though a long civilised race, are as primitive as savages in their dress, cabins, etc.; and this remark strikes me as very true. As soon as you get off the railways and main roads you find them living in their little huts under their coco-palms in the most primitive fashion, and probably much as they did when they first came to Ceylon, 2,000 or 3,000 years ago. On the 4th of this month (December), my friend “Ajax” landed at Colombo from England. He is on his way to Assam, in the tea-planting line, and is staying a week in the island to break the journey. He is a thorough Socialist in feeling, and a jolly fellow, always bright and good-natured, and with a great turn for music. We came up here to Kandy, and shortly after our arrival went to call on a Cinghalese peasant whose acquaintance I had lately made—Kalua by name—and found him in his little cabin, about a mile out of the town among the hills, where he lives with his brother Kirrah. Leaving Kandy by footpaths and alongside hedgerows overrun by a wild sunflower, and by that extraordinary creeper, with a verbena-like blossom, the lantana, which though said to have been introduced only27 about fifty years ago now runs in masses over the whole island, we came at last to a lovely little glen, with rice-lands laid out in terraces at the bottom, and tangles of scrub and jungle up the sides, among which were clumps of coco-nut and banana, indicating the presence of habitations. Under one of these groves, in a tiny little mud and thatch cabin, we found Kalua; in fact he saw us coming, and with a shout ran down to meet us. We were soon seated in the shade and talking such broken English and Tamil as we could respectively command. The brothers were very friendly, and brought us coco-nut milk and chágeri beer (made by cutting the28 great flower-bud off the chágeri palm, and letting the sap from the wounded stem flow into a jar, where it soon ferments; it has a musty flavor, and I cannot say that I care for it). Then their father, hearing of our arrival, came from half a mile off to have a look at us—a regular jolly old savage, with broad face and broad belly—but unfortunately, as we could not speak Cinghalese, there was no means of communicating with him, except by signs. This little valley seems to be chiefly occupied by the brothers and their kindred, forming a little tribe, so to speak. Kalua and his father both own good strips of rice-land, and are perhaps rather better off than most Cinghalese peasants, though that is not saying much. Married sisters and their children, and other relatives, also occupy portions of the glen; but Kalua and Kirrah are not married yet. It seems to be a point of honor with the Cinghalese (and indeed with most of the East Indian races) not to marry till their sisters are wedded. Like the Irish, the brothers work to provide a dowry for their sisters; and generally family feeling and helpfulness are very strong among them. To strike a father or a mother is, all over Ceylon (and India), a crime of almost unheard-of atrocity. Kalua gives a good deal of his earnings to his parents, and buys additions to the family rice-lands—which as far as I can make out are held to a considerable extent as common property. There was a native king and kingdom of Kandy till about eighty years ago (1814), when the British overthrew it; and it is curious that the old Kandian law—which was recognised for some time by the29 British—contains very evident traces of the old group-marriage which is found among so many races in their pre-civilisation period. There were two kinds of marriage treated of in the Kandian law—the Deega marriage, in which the wife went (as with us) to the house of her husband, and became more or less his property; and the Beena marriage, in which he came to live with her among her own people, but was liable to expulsion at any time! The latter form is generally supposed to be the more primitive, and belongs to the time when heredity is traced through the woman, and when also polygamous and polyandrous practices prevail. And this is confirmed by a paragraph of the Kandian law, or custom, which forbade intermarriage between the children of two brothers, or between the children of two sisters, but allowed it between the children of a brother and a sister—the meaning of course being that two brothers might have the same wife, or two sisters the same husband, but that a brother and sister—having necessarily distinct wives and husbands—would produce children who could not be more nearly related to each other than cousins. It is also confirmed by the fact that a kind of customary group-marriage still lingers among the Cinghalese—e.g. if a man is married, his brothers not uncommonly have access to the wife—though owing to its being discountenanced by Western habits and law, this practice is gradually dying out. Kalua has seen rather more of the world than some of his people, and has had opportunities of making a little money now and then. It appears30 that at the age of twelve or thirteen he took to “devil-dancing”—probably his father set him to it. He danced in the temple and got money; but now-a-days does not like the priests or believe in the temples. This devil-dancing appears to be a relic of aboriginal Kandian demon-worship: the evil spirits had to be appeased, or in cases of illness or misfortune driven away by shrieks and frantic gestures. It is a truly diabolical performance. The dancers (there are generally two of them) dress themselves up in fantastic array, and then execute the most extraordinary series of leaps, bounds, demivolts, and somersaults, in rhythmical climaxes, accompanied by clapping of hands, shrieks, and tomtomming, for about twenty minutes without stopping, by the end of which time the excitement of themselves and spectators is intense, and the patient—if there is one—is pretty sure to be either killed or cured! When the Buddhists came to the island they incorporated these older performances into their institutions. Some two or three years ago however Hagenbeck, of circus celebrity, being in Ceylon engaged a troupe of Kandians—of whom Kalua was one—to give a native performance for the benefit of the Europeans; and since that time the old peasant life has palled upon our friend, and it is evident that he lives in dreams of civilisation and the West. Kalua is remarkably well-made, and active and powerful. He is about twenty-eight, with the soft giraffe-like eyes of the Cinghalese, and the gentle somewhat diffident manner which they affect; his black hair is generally coiled in a knot behind his head, and, with an ornamental belt sustaining31 his colored skirt, and a shawl thrown over his shoulder, he looks quite handsome. Kirrah is thinner and weaker, both mentally and physically, with a clinging affectionateness of character which is touching. Then there are two nephews, Pinha and Punjha, whom I have seen once or twice—bright nice-looking boys, anxious to pick up phrases and words of English, and ideas about the wonderful Western world, which is beginning to dawn on their horizon—though alas! it will soon destroy their naked beauty and simplicity. To see Punjha go straight up the stem of a coco-nut tree fifty feet high is a caution! He just puts a noose of rope round his two feet to enable him to grasp the stem better with his soles, clasps his hands round the trunk, brings his knees up to his ears, and shoots up like a frog swimming!",
        "target_summary": "Ernst Haeckel's observation that the Cinghalese, despite their long civilization, maintain a primitive lifestyle—especially away from main roads—is affirmed by the narrator. Their way of life, in simple huts under coco-palms, appears little changed over millennia.\n\nThe narrator's friend, \"Ajax,\" a socialist tea-planter from England en route to Assam, stopped for a week in Ceylon. Described as jolly, good-natured, and musical, he and the narrator traveled to Kandy. From there, they trekked through a picturesque glen of terraced rice-lands, wild flora, and fruit groves, to visit a Cinghalese peasant named Kalua and his brother Kirrah in their \"tiny little mud and thatch cabin\" in the hills.\n\nThe brothers offered a friendly welcome, communicating in broken English and Tamil. They served coco-nut milk and *chágeri* beer (a fermented palm sap that the narrator found musty and unappealing). Kalua's father, a \"jolly old savage,\" soon joined them, though communication was limited to signs. This valley appeared to be primarily inhabited by Kalua's extended family, forming a small tribe. Kalua and his father owned good rice-lands, making them relatively better off than other peasants. Kalua and Kirrah, still unmarried, were working to provide dowries for their sisters—a strong point of honor and family obligation in Ceylon and India, where striking a parent is considered an atrocious crime. Kalua contributed earnings to his parents and additions to the family rice-lands, which were largely held as common property.\n\nThe old Kandian law, which governed the native kingdom until its British overthrow in 1814, showed clear traces of ancient group-marriage practices from pre-civilized periods. It recognized *Deega* marriage, where the wife joined her husband's household and became his property, and *Beena* marriage, where the husband joined his wife's family but was liable to expulsion. The *Beena* form was considered more primitive, linked to female lineage and polygamous or polyandrous customs. This was supported by Kandian law forbidding marriage between children of two brothers or two sisters, while allowing it between children of a brother and a sister, implying shared spouses among siblings. A form of customary group-marriage, where brothers might have access to a man's wife, still subtly lingered but was declining due to Western influence.\n\nKalua, having experienced more of the world, had earned money as a \"devil-dancer\" in his youth (around 12-13), a practice likely initiated by his father. This \"truly diabolical\" performance was a relic of aboriginal demon-worship to appease or expel evil spirits during illness or misfortune. It involved two fantastically dressed dancers executing frantic leaps, somersaults, shrieks, and drumming for twenty minutes, leading to intense excitement and often leaving the patient \"either killed or cured.\" Though incorporated into Buddhist institutions, Kalua now distrusted priests and temples. A pivotal event was when Hagenbeck, the circus impresario, hired Kalua's troupe for European audiences. This experience made Kalua disillusioned with traditional peasant life, and he now yearned for \"civilisation and the West.\"\n\nKalua, 28, was described as handsome, well-made, active, and powerful, with \"soft giraffe-like eyes,\" a gentle, diffident manner, and typically wore his black hair in a knot with an ornamental belt and shawl. His brother Kirrah was thinner and weaker, both mentally and physically, but had a touching, clinging affection. The narrator also met Kalua's nephews, Pinha and Punjha—bright boys eager to learn English and about the Western world, though the narrator lamented that this exposure would soon destroy their \"naked beauty and simplicity.\" Punjha's ability to scale a fifty-foot coconut tree using only a simple foot noose was particularly impressive.",

        "content": "The coco-nut palm is everything to the Cinghalese: they use the kernel of the nut for food, either as a curry along with their rice, or as a flavoring to cakes made of rice and sugar; the shell serves for drinking cups and primeval spoons; the husky fibre of course makes string, rope, and matting; the oil pressed from the nut, in creaking antique mills worked by oxen, is quite an article of commerce, and is used for anointing their hair and bodies, as well as for their little brass lamps and other purposes; the woody stems come in for the framework of cabins, and the great leaves either form an excellent thatch, or when plaited make natural screens, which in that climate often serve for the cabin-walls in place of anything more substantial. When Ajax told Kirrah that there were no coco-palms in32 England, the latter’s surprise was unfeigned as he exclaimed, “How do you live, then?” The other great staple of Cinghalese life is rice. Kalua’s family rice-fields lay below us in larger patches along the bottom of the glen, and terraced in narrow strips a little way up the hill at the head of it. The rice-lands are, for irrigation’s sake, always laid out in level patches, each surrounded by a low mud bank, one or two feet high; sometimes, where there is water at hand, they are terraced quite a good way up the hillsides, something like the vineyards in Italy. During and after the rains the water is led onto the various levels successively, which are thus well flooded. While in flood they are ploughed—with a rude plough drawn by humped cattle, or by buffalos—and sown as the water subsides. The crop soon springs up, a brilliant green, about as high as barley, but with an ear more resembling oats, and in seven or eight weeks is ready to be harvested. Boiled rice, with some curried33 vegetable or coco-nut, just to give it a flavor, is the staple food all over Ceylon among the natives—two meals a day, sometimes in poorer agricultural districts only one; a scanty fare, as their thin limbs too often testify. They use no bread, but a few cakes made of rice-flour and ghee and the sugar of the chágeri palm. The brothers’ cabin is primitive enough—just a little thatched place, perhaps twelve feet by eight, divided into two—a large wicker jar or basket containing store of rice, one or two boxes, a few earthenware pots for cooking in, fire lighted on the ground, no chair or table, and little sign of civilisation except a photograph or two stuck on the wall and a low cane-seated couch for sleeping on. The latter however is quite a luxury, as the Cinghalese men as often as not sleep on the earth floor. We stayed a little while chatting, while every now and then the great husked coco-nuts (of which you have to be careful) fell with a heavy thud from the trees; and then Kalua came on with us to Kandy, and we went to see the great Buddhist temple there, the Devala Maligawa, which contains the precious tooth-relic of Buddha.",
        "target_summary": "The coconut palm is indispensable to the Cinghalese, with every part serving a purpose: the kernel is food in curries and cakes; the shell forms drinking cups; the fibre creates string, rope, and matting; the oil, extracted by oxen, is a significant commercial product used for anointing, lamps, and other functions; stems provide cabin frameworks; and leaves serve as thatch or woven walls. The importance of the palm was highlighted by Kirrah's genuine surprise, asking \"How do you live, then?\" when told England lacked them.\n\nRice is the other fundamental staple. Fields, like Kalua's family patches, are terraced in level sections with low mud banks, crucial for irrigation. During and after rains, these levels are flooded, then ploughed and sown as the water recedes. The crop matures in seven to eight weeks. Boiled rice with curried vegetables or coconut is the daily native food across Ceylon, usually two meals a day, though sometimes a single, scanty meal. Rice-flour cakes are also made, but not bread.\n\nThe brothers' cabin is a primitive, small, thatched dwelling, divided into two rooms. Its sparse interior includes a large wicker rice jar, boxes, earthenware cooking pots, and a ground-level fire. There are no chairs or tables, with the only modern touches being a few photographs and a low cane-seated couch—a luxury, as most Cinghalese men sleep on the earth floor.

The old librarian priest was a charming specimen of a Buddhist priest—gentle, intelligent, and apparently with a vein of religious feeling in his character—and spoke with interest about the various texts and manuscripts. It is a pity that so much cannot be said of the Buddhist priests generally, who are as a rule—in Ceylon at any rate—an ignorant, dirty, betel-chewing and uninviting-looking lot. At the botanical gardens at Peradeniya—three or four miles out of Kandy—we saw a specimen of the talipot palm in full flower. This beautiful palm—unlike the coco palm—grows perfectly erect and straight; it flowers only once, and then dies. Haeckel says that it lives from fifty to eighty years, and that the blossom is sometimes thirty or forty feet long. The specimen that we saw in blossom was about forty-five feet high in the stem; and then from its handsome crown of huge leaves sprang a flower, or rather a branched spike of numerous white flowers, which I estimated at fifteen feet high (but which I afterwards saw described in the newspapers as twenty feet high). Baker says that the flower bud is often as much as four feet long, and that it opens with a smart report, when this beautiful white plume unfolds and lifts itself in the sun. The natives use the great leaf of the talipot—which is circular and sometimes eight or nine feet in diameter—as an umbrella. They fold it together along its natural corrugations, and then open it to ward off sun or rain.",

        "content": "Kandy is very beautiful. It stands nearly 2,000 feet high, by the side of an artificial lake which the old kings of Kandy made, and embosomed in hills covered by lovely woods full of tropical plants and flowers and commanding beautiful views from their slopes and summits. There is a small native town containing the usual mixed population of Cinghalese, Tamils, and Moor-men; there are one or two English hotels, a church, library and reading-room; a few residents’ houses, and a scattered population of English tea-planters on the hills for some miles round, who make Kandy their rendez-vous. Ajax makes great friends with the native youths and boys here; he has an easy friendly way with them, and they get hold of his hand and walk alongside. Of course they are delighted to find any Mahate who will treat them a little kindly; but I fear the few English about are much shocked at our conduct. When I first came to Ceylon my Tamil friend A. chaffed me about my way of calling him and the rest of the population, whether Tamil or Mahomedan or Cinghalese, all indiscriminately natives, “as if we were so many oysters.” I told this to Ajax, and of course there was nothing for it after that but to call them all oysters! We find the few British whom we have come across in our travels very much set against the “oysters.” There is something queer about the British and their insularity; but I suppose it is more their misfortune than their fault. Certainly they will allow that the oysters are not without merit—indeed if one keeps them to it they will often speak quite warmly of the tenderness and affectionateness38 of servants who have nursed them through long illnesses, etc.—but the idea of associating with them on terms of equality and friendship is somehow unspeakable and not to be entertained. It seems almost de rigueur to say something disparaging about the oyster, when that topic turns up—as a way of showing one’s own breeding, I suppose; after that has been done, however, it is allowable to grant that there are exceptions, and even to point out some kindly traits, pearls as it were, which are occasionally found in the poor bivalve. It strikes me however that the English are the chief losers by this insular habit. They look awfully bored and miserable as a rule in these up-country parts, which must almost necessarily be the case where there are only five or six residents in a station, or within accessible distances of each other, and confined entirely to each other’s society. One day Ajax and I went up to Nuwara Ellia. The railway carriage was full of tea-planters (including one or two wives and sisters), and there were a few at the hotel. It was curious to see some English faces of the cold-mutton-commercial type, and in quite orthodox English attire, in this out-of-the-way region. The good people looked sadly bored, and it seemed a point of honor with them to act throughout as if the colored folk didn’t exist or were invisible—also as if they were deaf, to judge by the shouting. In the evening however (at the hotel) we felt touched at the way in which they cheered up when Ajax and I played a few familiar tunes on the piano. They came round, saying it reminded them of home, and entreated us to go on;39 so we played for about two hours, Ajax improvising as usual in the most charming way. Nuwara Ellia is 6,000 feet above the sea—a little village with an hotel or two—a favorite resort from the sultry airs of Colombo and the lowlands. Here the Britisher finds fires in the sitting-rooms and thick mists outside, and dons his great-coat and feels quite at home. But we, having only just come from the land of fogs, did not appreciate these joys, and thought the place a little bleak and bare.",

It serves as a social gathering point for English tea-planters from the surrounding hills. Here, Ajax easily befriends native youths and boys, whose delight in his kindness is met with visible shock from the local English residents.\n\nThe author and Ajax adopt the humorous term \"oysters\" to refer indiscriminately to all local people—Tamil, Mohammedan, or Cinghalese—a private joke stemming from a Tamil friend's earlier criticism of the author for lumping everyone together as \"natives.\" They observe that the British they encounter generally hold strong prejudices against these \"oysters.\" The author views this \"queer\" British insularity as more of a misfortune than a fault. While the British might concede some merits to locals, even praising the tenderness of servants during illnesses, they find the idea of social equality or friendship \"unspeakable.\" It seems customary for them to disparage \"oysters\" to assert their social standing, though after this, they might acknowledge exceptions or \"pearls\" of kindly traits. The author concludes that the English are the chief losers due to this insular habit, often appearing bored and miserable in these remote regions, confined to the limited company of their fellow expatriates.\n\nThis social confinement was apparent during a trip to Nuwara Ellia with Ajax. Their railway carriage and the hotel were populated by tea-planters and their families. The author noted the peculiar sight of \"cold-mutton-commercial type\" English faces in \"orthodox English attire\" in this remote location. These individuals looked profoundly bored and deliberately ignored the local \"colored folk,\" acting as if they were invisible or deaf. However, that evening at the hotel, their demeanor dramatically changed when Ajax and the author played familiar tunes on the piano. The English guests, visibly touched and reminded of home, gathered around, cheering up and entreating them to continue for about two hours, with Ajax charmingly improvising. Nuwara Ellia, a small village at 6,000 feet, is a favored retreat from the sultry lowlands. Here, the British find comfort in fires and thick mists, donning great-coats and feeling \"at home.\" In contrast, the author and Ajax, having recently arrived from a foggy land, found the place rather bleak and did not appreciate these perceived \"joys.\"",

He is a cheerful little man, an immense talker, and very keen on politics. He was very amusing about the English; says they are very agreeable at first, “but after three months’ stay in the island a complete change comes over them—won’t speak to us or look at us—but I can give it them back.” His idea seems to be that representative institutions are wanted to restore to the people that interest in public life which has been taken from them by the destruction of their communal institutions under British rule. He seems to be a great hater of caste, and thinks the English have done much good in that matter. “I am loyal enough, because I know we are much better off than we should be under Russia. The English are stupid and incapable of understanding us, and don’t go among us to get understanding; but they mean well, according to their lights.” This place (called Kornegalle by the English) is a little town of 2,000 or 3,000 inhabitants, fifty miles from Colombo and eleven miles (by coach) from Polgahawella, the nearest railway station. It lies just at the foot of the mountain region of Ceylon,41 and takes its name, Kurunégala or Elephant-rock, from a huge Gibraltar-like rock, 600 feet high, at the base of which it nestles—and whose rounded dark granite structure, wrinkled with weather and largely bare of trees or any herbage, certainly bears a remarkable resemblance, both in form and color, to a couchant elephant. Ascending its steep sides, on which the sun strikes with fierce heat during the midday, one obtains from the summit a fine view—westward over low plains, eastward over mountain ranges rising higher and higher towards the centre of the island. The prevailing impression of the landscape here, as elsewhere in Ceylon, is its uniform green. There is no change of summer or winter. (Though this is the coolest time of year, the daily temperature ranges from 85° to 90° in the shade.) The trees do not cast their leaves at any stated time, though individual trees will sleep at intervals, resting so. In every direction the same color meets the eye—tracts of green scrub, green expanses of forest, green rice-fields, and the massed green of bananas and coco-palms. A little monotonous this in the general landscape, though it is plentifully compensated on a near view by the detailed color of insect and flower life. One curious feature is that though the country is well populated, hardly a trace of habitation is to be seen from any high point such as this. Even Kurunégala, which lies at our feet, is only distinguishable by its court-house and prison and one or two other emblems of civilisation; the native cabins, and even in many cases the European houses—which are of one storey only—are entirely hidden by trees. Those clumps however of coco-palms which you see42 standing like oases in the general woods, or breaking the levels of the rice-fields, with occasional traces of blue smoke curling up through them, are sure indications of little native hamlets clustered beneath—often far far from any road, and accessible only by natural footpaths worn by naked feet.",

While he hated the caste system and credited the English for positive changes in that regard, he was nonetheless loyal due to the alternative of Russia being worse. He found the English \"stupid and incapable of understanding\" locals, failing to engage with them, despite their good intentions.\n\nThe journey reached Kornegalle (Kurunégala), a small town of 2,000-3,000 inhabitants, fifty miles from Colombo and eleven miles from the nearest railway station.

A peculiar feature is that despite the country being well-populated, habitations are mostly hidden from high vantage points by dense trees; even Kurunégala itself is only discernible by its official buildings.

        "content": "From the top of the rock one gets a good view of the tank which supplies irrigation water for the town and neighborhood. It is about three-quarters of a mile long and half a mile broad, and forms a pretty little lake, over which kites hover and kingfishers skim, and in which the people daily bathe. These tanks and irrigation channels are matters of the43 utmost importance, to which I think Government can hardly give too much attention. Their importance was well understood in past times, as indeed the remains and ruins of immense works of this kind, over a thousand years old, in various parts of the island fully testify. A little is being done towards their renewal and restoration, but the tendency to-day is to neglect the interests of the rice-growing peasant in favor of the tea-planting Englishman. The paddy tax, which presses very hardly on the almost starving cultivator, while tea goes scot-free, is an instance of this. Tea, which is an export and a luxury, and which enriches the few, is thought to be so much more important than an article which is grown for home consumption and for the needs of the many. It is of course only an instance of the general commercial policy of all modern Governments; but one cannot the less for that think it a mistake, and an attempt to make the pyramid of social prosperity stand upon its apex. There is something curious—and indeed is it not self-contradictory?—in the fact that every country of the civilized world studies above all things the increase of its exports—is engaged, not in producing things primarily for its own use, but in trying to get other people to buy what it produces!—as if we all stood round and tried to shuffle off our bad wares on the others, in the hope that they by some accident might return us good stuff in exchange. Somehow the system does not seem as if it would work; it looks too like the case of that island where the inhabitants all earned a precarious living by taking in each other’s washing. What, one may ask, is really the cause of44 the enormous growth of this practice of neglecting production for use in favor of production for export and for the market? Is it not simply money and the merchant interest? Production at home by the population and for its own use is and always must be, one would think, by far the most important for the population and for its own comfort and welfare, though a margin may of course be allowed for the acquirement by exchange of some few articles which cannot be grown at home. But production such as this does not necessarily mean either money or mercantile transaction. Conceivably it may very well take place without either these or the gains which flow from their use—without profits or interest or dividends or anything of the kind. But this would never do! The money and commercial interest, which is now by far the most powerful interest in all modern states, is not such a fool as to favor a system of national economy which would be its own ruin. No; it must encourage trade in every way, at all costs. Trade, commerce, exchange, exports and imports—these are the things which bring dividends and interest, which fill the pockets of the parasites at the expense of the people; and so the nations stand round, obedient, and carry on the futile game till further orders. As a matter of fact in these hot countries, like Ceylon and India, almost unlimited results of productiveness can be got by perfected irrigation, and as long as the peasantry in these lands are (as they are) practically starving, and the irrigation works practically neglected, the responsibility for such a state of affairs must lie with the rulers; and naturally45 no mere shuffling of commercial cards, or encouragement of an export trade which brings fortunes into the hands of a few tea-planters and merchants, can be expected to make things better. It is sad to see the thin and famished mortals who come in here from the country districts round to beg. Many of them, especially the younger ones, have their limbs badly ulcerated. One day, going through the hospital, the doctor—a Eurasian—took me through a ward full of such cases. He said that they mostly soon got better with the better hospital diet; “but,” he added, “when they get back to their old conditions they are soon as bad as ever.” In fact the mass of the population in a place like Colombo looks far sleeker and better off than in these country districts; but that only affords another instance of how the modern policy encourages the shifty and crafty onhanger of commercial life at the cost of the sturdy agriculturist—and I need not say that the case is the same at home as abroad. It is quite a pretty sight to see the bathing in the tanks. It takes place in the early morning, and indeed during most of the day. Cleanliness is a religious observance, and engrained in the habits of the people. Of course there are exceptions, but save among the lowest castes this is the rule. An orthodox Hindu is expected not only to wash himself, but his own cloth, at least once a day. The climate makes bathing a pleasure, and the people linger over it. Men and boys, women and children, together or in groups not far distant from each other, revel and splash in the cool liquid; their colored wraps are rinsed and spread to dry on the46 banks, their brass pots glance in the sun as they dip the water with them and pour it over their own heads, their long black hair streams down their backs. Then, leaving the water, they pluck a twig from a certain tree, and, squatting on their hams, with the frayed twig-end rub their teeth and talk over the scandal of the day. This tooth-cleaning gossiping business lasts till they are dry, and often a good deal longer, and is, I fancy, one of the most enjoyable parts of the day to the mild oyster. In unsophisticated places there is no distinction of classes in this process, and rich and poor join in the public bathing alike—in fact there is very little difference in their dress and habits anyhow, as far as regards wealth and poverty—but of course where Western ideas are penetrating, the well-to-do natives adopt our habits and conduct their bathing discreetly at home. The people never (except it be children) go into the water quite naked, and the women always retain one of their wraps wound round the body. These wraps are very long, and the skill with which they manage to wash first one end and then the other, winding and unwinding, and remaining decorously covered all the time, is quite admirable. I am struck by the gravity and decorum of the people generally—in outer behavior or gesture—though their language (among the lower castes) is by no means always select! But there is none, or very little, of that banter between the sexes which is common among the Western populations, and even among the boys and youths you see next to no frolicking or bear-fighting. I suppose it is part47 of the passivity and want of animal spirits which characterise the Hindu; and of course the sentiment of the relation between the sexes is different in some degree from what it is with us. On sexual matters generally, as far as I can make out, the tendency, even among the higher castes, is to be outspoken, and there is little of that prudery which among us is only after all a modern growth.",
        "target_summary": "The excerpt describes a vital irrigation tank in Ceylon, highlighting its historical significance and current state. The author criticizes the modern government's neglect of these crucial works and the local rice-growing peasantry. Current policy, driven by an export economy, favors tea-planting Englishmen through tax exemptions while heavily taxing struggling rice cultivators. This approach, common among modern governments, enriches a few (merchants and tea planters) at the expense of the many, prioritizing production for export and profit over local consumption and public welfare. The author views this system, fueled by powerful mercantile interests, as self-defeating and exploitative, benefiting \"parasites\" through trade, dividends, and interest rather than the general population.\n\nIn regions like Ceylon and India, despite immense potential for productivity through improved irrigation, widespread peasant starvation persists due to neglected infrastructure and misdirected government priorities. This results in observable suffering, with rural inhabitants exhibiting severe health issues that only temporarily improve with hospital care. The disparity between relatively better-off urban populations and struggling agriculturists illustrates how modern policies inadvertently support commercial opportunists over hard-working farmers.\n\nThe text then details the daily, communal bathing rituals in the tanks. This activity, a religious observance, involves people of all ages and, traditionally, all classes, cleansing themselves, washing clothes, and socializing. The scene emphasizes their ingrained cleanliness, skill in maintaining modesty with wraps, and the unique social interaction that includes teeth-cleaning and gossiping. The author notes a general gravity and decorum among the people, with little of the boisterous banter common in Western societies, attributing it to a Hindu \"passivity.\" Finally, the author observes an openness in discussing sexual matters, even among higher castes, which is contrasted with what is perceived as modern Western prudery.",

        "content": "The town here is a queer mixture of primitive life with modern institutions. There are two or three little streets of booths, which constitute the “bazaar.” Walking down these—where behind baskets of wares the interiors of the dwellings are often visible, and the processes of life are naïvely48 exposed to the eye—one may judge for one’s self how little man wants here below. Here is a fruit and vegetable shop, with huge bunches of plantains or bananas, a hundred in a bunch, and selling at five or six a penny; of a morning you may see the peasant coming in along the road carrying two such bunches—a good load—slung one at each end of a long pole, or pingo, over his shoulder—a similar figure to that which is so frequent on the Egyptian monuments of 3,000 years ago; pineapples, from 1d. up to 4d. each for the very finest; the breadfruit, and its queer relation the enormous jack-fruit, weighing often as much as 12 to 14 lbs., with its pulpy and not very palatable interior, used so much by the people, growing high up over their cabins on the handsome jack-tree, and threatening you with instant dissolution if it descend upon your head; the egg-plant, murngal, beans, potatos, and other vegetables; and plentiful ready-prepared packets of areca nut and betel leaf for chewing. Then there is a shop where they sell spices, peppers, chilis, and all such condiments for curries, not to mention baskets of dried fish (also for currying), which stink horribly and constitute one of the chief drawbacks of the bazaars; and an earthenware shop,—and I must not forget the opium shop. Besides these there are only two others—and they represent Manchester and Birmingham respectively—one where they sell shoddy and much-sized cotton goods, and the other which displays tin ware, soap, matches, paraffin lamps, dinner knives, and all sorts of damnable cutlery. I have seen these knives and scissors, or such as these (made only to deceive),49 being manufactured in the dens of Sheffield by boys and girls slaving in dust and dirt, breathing out their lives in foul air under the gaslights, hounded on by mean taskmasters and by the fear of imminent starvation. Dear children! if you could only come out here yourselves, instead of sending the abominable work of your hands—come out here to enjoy this glorious sunshine, and fraternise, as I know many of you would, with the despised darkie! The opium-seller is a friend of mine. I often go and sit in his shop—on his one chair. He teaches me Tamil—for he is a Tamil—and tells me long stories, slowly, word by word. He is a thin, soft-eyed, intelligent man, about thirty, has read a fair amount of English—of a friendly riant child-nature—not without a reasonable eye to the main chance, like some of his Northern cousins. There are a few jars of opium in its various forms—for smoking, drinking, and chewing; a pair of scales to weigh it with; a brass coconut-oil lamp with two or three wicks hanging overhead; and a partition for the bed at the back,—and that is all. The shopfront is of course entirely open to the thronged street, except at night, when it is closed with shutterboards. At the corner of the street stands a policeman, of course, else we should not know we were being civilised. But, O Lord, what a policeman! How a London street arab would chuckle all over at the sight of him! Imagine the mild and somewhat timid oyster dressed in a blue woollen serge suit (very hot for this climate), with a belt round his waist, some kind of turban on his head, a staff in50 his hand, and boots on his feet! A real live oyster in boots! It is too absurd. How miserable he looks; and as to running after a criminal—the thing is not to be thought of. But no doubt the boots vindicate the majesty of the British Government. While we are gazing at this apparition, a gang of prisoners marches by—twenty lean creatures, with slouched straw hats on their heads, striped cotton jackets and pants, and bare arms and lower legs, each carrying a mattock—for they are going to work on the roads—and the whole gang followed and guarded (certainly Ceylon is a most idyllic land) by a Cinghalese youth of about twenty-one, dressed in white skirts down to his feet, with a tortoise-shell comb on his head, and holding a parasol to shade himself from the sun. Why do not the twenty men with mattocks turn and slay the boy with the parasol, and so depart in peace? I asked this question many times, and always got the same answer. “Because,” they said, “the prisoners do not particularly want to run away. They are very well off in prison,—better off, as a rule, than they are outside. Imprisonment by an alien Government, under alien laws and standards, is naturally no disgrace, at any rate to the mass of the people, and so once in prison they make themselves as happy as they can.” I visited the gaol one day, and thought they succeeded very well in that respect. The authorities, I am glad to say, do all they can to make them comfortable. They have each a large dish of rice and curry, with meat if they wish, twice a day, and a meal of coffee and bread in the morning51 besides; which is certainly better fare than they would get as peasants. They do their little apology for work in public places during the day—with a chance of a chat with friends—and sleep in gangs together in the prison sheds at night, each with his mat, pillow, and night suit; so possibly on the whole they are not ill-content. My friend A——, with whom I am staying here, is a Tamil, and an official of high standing. He became thoroughly Anglicised while studying in England, and like many of the Hindus who come to London or Cambridge or Oxford, did for the time quite outwesternise us in the tendency towards materialism and the belief in science, ‘comforts,’ representative institutions, and ‘progress’ generally. Now however he seems to be undergoing a reaction in favor of caste and the religious traditions of his own people, and I am inclined to think that other westernising Hindus will experience the same reaction. He lives in an ordinary one-storied stone house, or bungalow, such as the English inhabit here. These houses, naturally cover a good deal of ground. The roof, which is made of heavy tiles or thatch, is pitched high in the middle, giving space for lofty sitting-rooms; the sleeping chambers flank these at a lower slope, and outside runs the verandah, almost round the house, the roof terminating beyond it at six or seven feet from the ground. This arrangement makes the interiors very dark and cool, as the windows open on the verandah, and the sun cannot penetrate to them; but I am not sure that I like the sensation of being confined under this52 immense carapace of tiles, with no possible outlook to the sky, in a sort of cavernous twilight all the while. The verandah forms an easy means of access from one part to another, and in this house there are no passages in the interior, but the rooms all open into one another; and plentiful windows—some mere Venetian shutters, without glass—ensure a free circulation of air. Mosquitos are a little trying. I don’t think they are more venomous than the English gnat, but they are far ’cuter. The mosquito is the ’cutest little animal for its size that exists. I am certain from repeated observations that it watches one’s eyes. If you look at it, it flies away. It settles on the under side of your hand (say when reading a book), or on your ankles when sitting at table—on any part in fact which is remote from observation; there is nothing that it loves better than for you to sit in a cane-bottomed chair. But it never attacks your face—and that is a curious thing—except when you are asleep. How it knows I cannot tell, but I have often noticed that it is so. If you close your eyes and pretend to be asleep, it will not come; but as sure as you begin to drowse off you hear the ping of its little wing as it swoops past your ear to your cheek.",
        "target_summary": "The town presents a curious blend of primitive life and modern institutions, centered around a bazaar of booths where daily life is openly displayed, revealing the simple needs of its inhabitants. Market stalls feature abundant, inexpensive produce like plantains, bananas (often carried by peasants on poles, a sight reminiscent of ancient Egypt), pineapples, and huge jack-fruit, which, despite its unpalatable pulp, is widely consumed and poses a hazard if it falls from the trees. Other common vegetables and prepared packets of betel and areca nut are also sold.\n\nBeyond food, the bazaar includes shops selling spices, curry condiments (including horribly stinking dried fish), and earthenware. The author notes an opium shop and two others representing Manchester and Birmingham, offering shoddy cotton goods and various tinware, soap, lamps, and \"damnable\" cutlery. The author critiques this imported cutlery, recalling its manufacture in Sheffield by child laborers slaving in dust and foul air, wishing they could instead enjoy the local sunshine and camaraderie.\n\nThe opium seller, a soft-eyed, intelligent Tamil man of about thirty who speaks English, is a friend of the author, teaching him Tamil and sharing long stories. His simple shop displays various forms of opium, scales, a brass oil lamp, and a bed partition, with its front open to the street by day. Nearby stands a local policeman, a figure the author finds absurd—a mild, timid man dressed unsuitably in a hot blue woollen uniform with a turban and boots. Though his appearance seems ill-suited for law enforcement, his boots are facetiously noted as upholding British majesty.\n\nObserving a gang of twenty lean prisoners carrying mattocks for road work, guarded by a single Cinghalese youth with a parasol, the author questions why they don't escape. He learns that prisoners often prefer incarceration, viewing it as no disgrace under an alien government, and are generally better cared for than as peasants. They receive ample food (rice, curry, meat, coffee, bread), perform minimal work in public, and sleep comfortably with mats and pillows, leading to overall contentment.\n\nThe author is staying with a high-ranking Tamil friend, A, who, after becoming thoroughly Anglicised studying in England—embracing materialism, science, and Western comforts—is now reacting by reverting to his people's caste and religious traditions, a trend the author believes other Westernised Hindus will follow. Friend A lives in a typical English-style, one-story stone bungalow with a large footprint. Its high-pitched tiled or thatched roof creates lofty sitting rooms flanked by lower sleeping chambers, all surrounded by a wide verandah. This design keeps the interior dark and cool, as windows open onto the verandah, blocking direct sunlight, though the author feels confined by this \"immense carapace\" without a sky view. Inside, rooms open into one another without passages, and numerous windows, some just shutters, ensure good air circulation.\n\nFinally, the author describes the local mosquitoes as troublesome and remarkably cunning. He observes they watch eyes and fly away if looked at, preferring to land on unobserved body parts like the underside of hands or ankles. Curiously, they avoid the face unless one is asleep or beginning to doze, detecting the exact moment of drowsiness.",

        "content": "At night however the mosquito curtains keep one in safety, and I cannot say that I am much troubled during the day, except on occasions, and in certain places, as in the woods when there is no breeze. A. is a vegetarian, and I fancy diet has a good deal to do with freedom from irritation by insects and by heat. The thermometer reaches53 90° in the shade almost every day here; to sit and run at the same time is a gymnastic feat which one can easily perform, and at night it is hot enough to sleep without any covering on the bed; but I enjoy the climate thoroughly, and never felt in better health. No doubt these things often affect one more after a time than at first; but there seems almost always a pleasant breeze here at this time of year, and I do not notice that languor which generally accompanies sultry weather. A. has most lovely vegetable curries; plenty of boiled rice, with four or five little dishes of different sorts of curried vegetables. This, with fruit, forms our breakfast—at ten; and dinner at six or seven is much the same, with perhaps an added soup or side-dish. His wife sometimes joins us at dinner, which I take as an honor, as even with those Hindu women who are emancipated there is often a little reserve about eating with the foreigner. She has a very composed and gentle manner, and speaks English prettily and correctly, though slowly and with a little hesitation; approves of a good deal of the English freedom for women, but says she cannot quite reconcile herself to women walking about the streets alone, and other things she hears they do in England. However, she would like to come to England herself and see. The children are very bright and charming. Mahéswari (three years old) is the sweetest little dot, with big black eyes and a very decided opinion about things. She comes into the room and lifts up one arm and turns up her face and prophesies something in solemn tones in Tamil, which turns out to54 be, “Father is very naughty to sit down to dinner before mother comes.” Then she talks Cinghalese to her nurse and English to me, which is pretty good for a beginner in life. Mahadéva and Jayanta, the two boys (seven and nine respectively), are in the bubbling-over stage, and are alternately fast friends and fighting with each other two or three times a day, much like English boys. They are dressed more after the English fashion, though they are privileged to have bare knees and feet—at any rate in the house; and Jayanta has a pony which he rides out every day. A. sets apart a little room in this house as a “chapel.” It is quite bare, with just a five-wicked lamp on a small table in one corner, and flowers, fruit, etc., on the ground in front. I was present the other day when the Brahman priest was performing a little service there. He recited Sanskrit formulas, burned camphor, and gave us cowdung ashes and sandalwood paste to put on our foreheads, consecrated milk to drink, and a flower each. The cowdung ashes are a symbol. For as cowdung, when burnt, becomes clean and even purifying in quality, so must the body itself be consumed and purified in the flame of Siva’s presence. A. says they use a gesture identifying the light (of Siva) within the body with the light of the flame, and also with that of the sun; and always terminate their worship by going out into the open and saluting the sun. The Brahman priest, a man about forty, and the boy of fifteen who often accompanies him, are pleasant-faced folk, not apparently at all highly educated, wearing but little in the way of clothes,55 and not specially distinguishable from other people, except by the sacred thread worn over the shoulder, and a certain alertness of expression which is often noticeable in the Brahman—though the trouble is that it is generally alertness for gain. The priests generally here, whether Buddhist or Hindu (and Buddhism is of course the prevailing religion in Ceylon), occupy much the same relation to the people which the priests occupy in the country districts of France or Ireland—that is, whatever spiritual power they claim, they do not arrogate to themselves any worldly supremacy, and are always poor and often quite unlettered. In fact I suppose it is only in the commercially religious, i.e. Protestant, countries that the absurd anomaly exists of a priesthood which pretends to the service of the Jesus who had not where to lay his head, and which at the same time openly claims to belong to “society” and the well-to-do classes, and would resent any imputation to the contrary. There are indeed many points of resemblance between the religions here—especially Hinduism—and Roman Catholicism: the elaborate ceremonials and services, with processions, incense, lights, ringing of bells, etc.; the many mendicant orders, the use of beads and rosaries, and begging bowls, the monasteries with their abbots, and so forth.",

        "content": "There is one advantage in a hot damp climate like this; namely that things—books, furniture, clothes, etc.—soon get destroyed and done with, so that there is little temptation to cumber up your house with possessions. Some English of course try to furnish and keep their rooms as if they were56 still living in Bayswater, but they are plentifully plagued for their folly. The floors here are of some cement or concrete material, which prevents the white ants surging up through them, as they infallibly would through boards, and which is nice and cool to the feet; carpets, cupboards, and all collections of unremoved things are discountenanced. A chest of drawers or a bookcase stands out a foot or two from the wall, so that the servants can sweep behind it every day. Little frogs, lizards, scorpions, and other fry, which come hopping and creeping in57 during or after heavy rain can then be gently admonished to depart, and spiders do not find it easy to establish a footing. The greatest harbor for vermin is the big roof, which is full of rats. In pursuit of these come the rat-snakes, fellows five or six feet long, but not venomous, and wild cats; and the noises at night from them, the shuffling of the snakes, and the squeals of the poor little rats, etc., I confess are trying. We have three or four male servants about the house and garden, and there are two ayahs, who look after the children and the women’s apartments. I believe many of these Indian and Cinghalese races love to be servants (under a tolerably good master); their feminine sensitive natures, often lacking in enterprise, rather seek the shelter of dependence. And certainly they make, in many instances and when well treated, wonderfully good servants, their tact and affectionateness riveting the bond. I know of a case in which an English civilian met with an accident when 200 miles away from his station, and his “bearer,” when he heard the news, in default of other means of communication, walked the whole distance, and arrived in time to see him before he died. At the same time it is a mistake to suppose they will do anything out of a sense of duty. The word duty doesn’t occupy an important place in the Oriental vocabulary, no more than it does among the Celtic peoples of Europe. This is a fruitful source of misunderstanding between the races. The Britisher pays his Indian servant regularly, and in return expects him to do his duty, and to submit to kicks when he doesn’t. He, the58 Britisher, regards this as a fair contract. But the oyster doesn’t understand it in the least. He would rather receive his pay less regularly, and be treated as “a man and a brother.” Haeckel’s account of the affection of his Rodiya servant-lad for him, and of the boy’s despair when Haeckel had to leave him, is quite touching; but it is corroborated by a thousand similar stories. But if there is no attachment, what is the meaning of duty? The oyster, in keeping with his weaker, more dependent nature, is cunning and lazy—his vices lie in that direction rather than in the Western direction of brutal energy. If his attachment is not called out, he can make his master miserable in his own way. And he does so; hence endless strife and recrimination. The Arachchi here, a kind of official servant of A.’s, is a most gentle creature, with remarkable tact, but almost too sensitive; one is afraid of wounding him by not accepting all his numerous attentions. He glides in and out of the room—as they all do—noiselessly, with bare feet; and one never knows whether one is alone or not. The horse-keeper and I are good friends, though our dialogues are limited for want of vocabulary! He is a regular dusky demon, with his look of affectionate bedevilment and way of dissolving in a grin whenever he sees one. A. says that he thinks the pariahs, or outcastes—and the horse-keepers are pariahs—are some of the most genuine and good-hearted among the people; and I see that the author of Life in an Indian Village says something of the same kind. “As a class, hardworking, honest, and truthful,” he calls them; and after describing their devotion to59 the interests of the families to whom they are often hereditarily attached, adds, “Such are the illiterate pariahs, a unique class, whose pure lives and noble traits of character are in every way worthy of admiration.” It is curious, but I am constantly being struck by the resemblance between the lowest castes here and the slum-dwellers in our great cities—resemblance in physiognomy, as well as in many unconscious traits of character, often very noble; with the brutish basis well-marked, the unformed mouth, and the somewhat heavy brows, just as in Meunier’s fine statue of the ironworker (“puddleur”), but with thicker lips.",
        "target_summary": "The hot, damp climate rapidly destroys possessions, encouraging a minimalist approach to home furnishing. Houses are designed for practicality: concrete floors prevent white ants and offer coolness, while furniture is kept a foot or two from walls for daily sweeping. This setup helps manage small creatures like frogs, lizards, scorpions, and spiders that enter after heavy rain. However, the roofs harbor rats, attracting non-venomous, five-to-six-foot-long rat-snakes and wild cats, whose nighttime shuffling and squealing noises are described as \"trying.\"\n\nThe household employs several male servants for the house and garden, alongside two ayahs for children and women's apartments. The narrator suggests that many Indian and Cinghalese people, due to their \"feminine sensitive natures\" and tendency to seek \"shelter of dependence,\" genuinely enjoy being servants under kind masters. When well-treated, they prove \"wonderfully good servants,\" demonstrating tact and affection; an example cited is a \"bearer\" who walked 200 miles to be with his dying master.\n\nHowever, a significant cultural misunderstanding arises regarding \"duty.\" For British employers, regular pay implies a contractual \"duty,\" and they expect obedience even to \"kicks\" if duties are neglected. The narrator contends that for servants, however, \"duty\" is not a prominent concept; instead, they value personal attachment and being treated as \"a man and a brother\" over strictly regular pay. Stories like Haeckel's servant's despair illustrate this deep attachment. Without such a bond, servants, described as having a \"weaker, more dependent nature,\" tend towards \"cunning and laziness\"—vices distinct from a \"Western direction of brutal energy.\" This lack of attachment can lead to servants making their masters \"miserable,\" resulting in \"endless strife and recrimination.\"\n\nAmong specific individuals, the Arachchi, an official servant, is portrayed as a gentle, remarkably tactful, but almost *too* sensitive figure, whose noiseless movements make it unclear if one is alone. The horse-keeper is a \"dusky demon\" with an affectionate look and a ready grin, establishing a good friendship with the narrator despite language barriers. A. believes that pariahs or outcastes, including horse-keepers, are \"most genuine and good-hearted.\" This view is corroborated by \"Life in an Indian Village,\" which describes them as \"hardworking, honest, and truthful,\" devoted to their hereditary families, and possessing \"pure lives and noble traits of character\" worthy of admiration.\n\nFinally, the narrator observes a \"curious\" resemblance between the lowest castes in this climate and slum-dwellers in European cities. This similarity extends to physiognomy—marked by a \"brutish basis,\" \"unformed mouth,\" and \"heavy brows\" (like Meunier's ironworker statue, but with thicker lips)—and to \"many unconscious traits of character, often very noble.\"",

        "content": "January 1st, 1891.—Sitting by an impromptu wood-fire in a little hut on the summit of Adam’s Peak—nearly midnight—a half-naked Caliban out of the woods squatting beside me, and Kalua and the guide sleeping on the floor. But I find it too cold to sleep, and there is no furniture in the hut. Altogether an eventful New Year’s day. Last night I spent at Kandy with Kalua and his brother in their little cabin. They were both very friendly, and I kept being reminded of Herman Melville and his Marquesas Island experiences—so beautiful the scene, the moon rising about ten, woods and valleys all around—the primitive little hut, Kirrah cooking over a fire on the ground, etc. We were up by moon and starlight at 5 a.m., and by walking, driving, and the railway, reached Muskeliya at the foot of the peak by 2.30 p.m. There we got a guide—a very decent young Tamil—and reached here by 7.30 or 8 p.m. Our path lay at first through tea-gardens, and then leaving them, it went in nearly a direct line straight up the mountain side—perhaps 3,000 feet—through dense woods, in step-like formation, over tree-roots and up the rocks, worn and hacked into shape through successive centuries by innumerable pilgrims, but still only wide enough61 for one. Night came upon us on the way, and the last hour or two we had to light torches to see our route. Elephant tracks were plentiful all round us through the woods, even close to the summit. It is certainly extraordinary on what steep places and rock sides these animals will safely travel; but we were not fortunate enough to see any of them. This is a long night trying to sleep. It is the wretchedest hut, without a door, and unceiled to the four winds! Caliban makes the fire for me as I write. He has nothing on but a cotton wrap and a thin jersey, but does not seem to feel the cold much; and the guide is even more thinly clad, and is asleep, while I am shivering, bundled in cloth coats. There is something curious about the way in which the English in this country feel the cold—when it is cold—more than the natives; though one might expect the contrary. I have often noticed it. I fancy we make a great mistake in these hot lands in not exposing our skins more to the sun and air, and so strengthening and hardening them. In the great heat, and when constantly covered with garments, the skin perspires terribly, and becomes sodden and enervated, and more sensitive than it ought to be—hence great danger of chills. I have taken several sun-baths in the woods here at different times, and found advantage from doing so. [Since writing the above, I have discovered the existence of a little society in India—of English folk—who encourage nudity, and the abandonment as far as possible of clothes, on three distinct grounds—physical, moral, and æsthetic—of Health,62 Decency, and Beauty. I wish the society every success. Its chief object, as given in its rules, is to urge upon people “to be and go stark naked whenever suitable,” and it is a sine quâ non that members should appear at all its meetings without any covering Passing over the moral and æsthetic considerations—which are both of course of the utmost importance in this connection—there is still the consideration of physical health and enjoyment, which must appeal to everybody. In a place like India, where the mass of the people go with very little covering, the spectacle of their ease and enjoyment must double the discomforts of the unfortunate European who thinks it necessary to be dressed up to the eyes on every occasion when he appears in public. It is indeed surprising that men can endure, as they do, to wear cloth coats and waistcoats and starched collars and cuffs, and all the paraphernalia of propriety, in a severity of heat which really makes only the very lightest covering tolerable; nor can one be surprised at the exhaustion of the system which ensues, from the cause already mentioned. In fact the direct stimulation and strengthening of the skin by sun and air, though most important in our home climate, may be even more indispensable in a place like India, where the relaxing influences are so terribly strong. Certainly, when one considers this cause of English enervation in India, and the other due to the greatly mistaken diet of our people there, the fearful quantities of flesh consumed, and of strong liquors—both things which are injurious enough at home, but which are ruinous in a hot country—the wonder is not that the English fail to63 breed and colonise in India, but that they even last out their few years of individual service there.]",
        "target_summary": "On January 1st, 1891, the narrator found himself cold and sleepless in a primitive, unfurnished hut on Adam's Peak, observing his thinly clad native companions seemingly unaffected by the chill. He recalled an eventful New Year's Day, having spent the previous night in Kandy with Kalua and his brother, a friendly and idyllic scene reminiscent of Herman Melville's accounts. Their journey to the peak began at 5 a.m., combining walking, driving, and rail to reach Muskeliya by mid-afternoon. From there, a Tamil guide led them on a steep, 3,000-foot ascent through tea gardens and dense woods. The centuries-old pilgrim path, narrow and challenging, necessitated torches as night fell during their climb. They noted abundant elephant tracks, even near the summit, though they saw no elephants.\n\nThe narrator, bundled in heavy coats, shivered, contrasting sharply with his thinly clad native companions who appeared immune to the cold in the drafty hut. He observes that English people in India curiously feel the cold more acutely than natives. He attributes this to the English habit of not exposing their skin to sun and air in hot climates; constant covering leads to excessive perspiration, enervated skin, increased sensitivity, and a greater risk of chills. He notes personal benefits from taking sun-baths.\n\nFollowing these reflections, he discovered an English society in India promoting nudity for physical, moral, and aesthetic health. He emphasizes the physical benefits, noting the striking contrast between the comfort of lightly-clad natives and the discomfort of Europeans burdened by heavy, formal attire in severe heat, which he believes leads to exhaustion. He further criticizes the English diet in India, citing the detrimental consumption of large quantities of meat and strong alcohol, which are especially ruinous in a hot climate. The narrator concludes that these combined factors—inappropriate clothing and diet—significantly hinder the English's ability to thrive, colonize, or even endure their service years in India.",

        "content": "There is a lovely view of cloudland from the summit now the moon has risen. All the lower lands and mountains are wrapped in mist, and you look down upon a great white rolling sea, silent, remote from the world, with only the moon and stars above, and the sound of the Buddhist priests chanting away in a low tone round the fire in their own little cabin or pansela. This is a most remarkable mountain. For at least 2, 000 years, and probably for long enough before that, priests of some kind or another have kept watch over the sacred footmark on the summit; for thousands of years the sound of their chanting has been heard at night between the driven white plain of clouds below and the silent moon and stars above; and by day pilgrims have toiled up the steep sides to strew flowers, and to perform some kind of worship to their gods, on this high natural altar. The peak is 7, 400 feet high, and though not quite the highest point in the island, is by far the most conspicuous. It stands like a great outpost on the south-west edge of the mountain region of Ceylon, and can be seen from far out to sea—a sugar-loaf with very precipitous sides. When the Buddhists first came to Ceylon, about the 4th century b.c., they claimed the footmark as that of Buddha. Later on some Gnostic Christian sects attributed it to the primal man; the Mahomedans, following this idea, when they got possession of the mountain, gave it the name of Adam’s Peak; the Portuguese consecrated it to S. Eusebius; and now the Buddhists64 are again in possession—though I believe the Mahomedans are allowed a kind of concurrent right. But whatever has been the nominal dedication of this ancient “high place,” a continuous stream of pilgrims—mainly of course the country folk of the island—has flowed to it undisturbed through the centuries; and even now they say that in the month of May the mountain side is covered by hundreds and even thousands of folk, who camp out during the night, and do poojah on the summit by day. Kalua says that his father—the jolly old savage—once ascended “Samantakuta,” and like the rest of the Cinghalese thinks a great deal of the religious merit of this performance. Ratnapura, Jan. 3rd.—Sunrise yesterday on the peak was fine, though “sunrises” are not always a success. The great veil of clouds gradually dissolved, and a long level “rose of dawn” appeared in the eastern sky—Venus brilliant above it, the Southern Cross visible, and one or two other crosses which lie near it, and the half moon overhead; a dark, peaked and castellated rampart of lower mountains stretched around us, and far on the horizon were masses of cumulus cloud rising out of the lowland mists, and catching the early light; while the lower lands themselves remained partly hidden by irregular pools and rivers of white fog, which looked like water in the first twilight. A great fan-like crown of rays preceded the sun, very splendid, of pearly colors, with great beams reaching nearly to the zenith. We could not see the sea, owing to mists along the horizon, nor was any habitation visible, but only the great jungle-covered hills and65 far plains shrouded in the green of coco-nut groves. The shadow of the peak itself, cast on the mists at sunrise, is a very conspicuous and often-noted phenomenon. Owing to the sun’s breadth, the effect is produced of an umbra and penumbra; and the umbra looks very dark and pointed—more pointed even than the peak itself. I was surprised to see how distant it looked—a shadow-mountain among the far crags. It gradually fell and disappeared as the sun rose.",
        "target_summary": "From the summit of this remarkable mountain, a moonlit night offers a stunning view of a misty \"cloudland,\" with lower lands veiled, resembling a vast, silent \"rolling sea.\" The low chanting of Buddhist priests can be heard from their cabin. For over 2,000 years, priests have continuously guarded a sacred footmark on this 7,400-foot peak in Ceylon, and pilgrims have ascended daily to worship. Though not the island's highest, it is its most conspicuous feature, a precipitous \"sugar-loaf\" visible far out at sea.\n\nHistorically, the footmark has held diverse religious significance: claimed by Buddhists (4th century B.C.), attributed to the primal man by Gnostic Christians, named Adam's Peak by Mahomedans, and consecrated to S. Eusebius by the Portuguese. Today, Buddhists are again in possession, sharing concurrent rights with Mahomedans. Despite these changing dedications, a continuous stream of pilgrims has flowed to this ancient \"high place\" for centuries, with thousands gathering and camping in May.\n\nA recent sunrise from the peak was spectacular: the cloud veil dissolved to reveal a \"rose of dawn\" in the eastern sky, accompanied by Venus, the Southern Cross, and a half-moon. Dark, peaked lower mountains formed a rampart, while distant cumulus clouds and fog-covered lowlands caught the early light. A splendid, pearly, \"fan-like crown of rays\" preceded the sun. Mists obscured the sea and habitations, revealing only jungle-covered hills and coconut groves. A notable phenomenon was the peak's dark, pointed shadow cast on the mists, appearing as a \"shadow-mountain\" among distant crags, which gradually receded as the sun ascended.",

        "content": "There is another phenomenon which I have somewhere seen described as peculiar to Adam’s Peak; though this must be a pious fraud, or one of those cases of people only being able to see familiar things when they are in unfamiliar surroundings, since it is a phenomenon which can be witnessed any day at home. It is that if when there is dew or rain upon the grass, and the sun is not too high in the heavens, you look at the shadow of your head on the grass, you will see it surrounded by a white light, or ‘glory.’ It arises, I imagine, from the direct reflection of the sunlight on the inner surfaces of the little globules of water which lie in or near the line joining the sun and the head, and is enhanced no doubt by the fact that the light so reflected shows all the clearer from having to pass through a column of shadow to the eye. Anyhow, whatever the cause, it is quite a flattering appearance, all the more so because if you have a companion you do not see the ‘glory’ round his head, but only round your own! I once nearly turned the strong brain of a Positivist by pointing out to66 him this aureole round his head, and making as if I could see it. He of course, being unable to see a similar light round mine, had no alternative but to conclude that he was specially overshadowed by the Holy Ghost! The sripada—“sacred foot”—is better than I expected: a natural depression in the rock, an inch or so deep, five feet long, 1 of an oblong shape, and distantly resembling a foot; but they have “improved” it in parts by mortaring bits of tile along the doubtful edges! There are no toes marked, though in “copies” of it that I have seen in some Buddhist shrines the toes are carefully indicated. The mark is curiously situated at the very summit of the rock—which is only a few feet square, only large enough, in fact, to give space for the foot and for a little pavilion, open to the winds, which has been erected over it; and on the natural platform just below—which (so steep is the mountain) is itself encircled by a wall to prevent accidents—are some curious bits of furniture: four old bronze standard lamps, of lotus-flower design, one at each corner of the platform, a bell, a little shrine, and the priests’ hut before mentioned. Looking into the latter after dawn, I beheld nothing resembling furniture, but a pan in the middle with logs burning, and three lean figures squatted round it, their mortal possessions tied in handkerchiefs and hanging from the roof. 1 Captain Knox, above quoted, speaks of it as “about two feet long”; but he does not appear to have actually seen it. The priests were horribly on the greed for money, and made it really unpleasant to stay on67 the top; but I delayed a little in order to watch Caliban doing poojah at the little shrine I have mentioned. He brought a hot ember from the fire, sprinkled frankincense on it, burned camphor and something that looked like saltpetre, also poured some kind of scented water on the ember, causing fragrance. Very ancient gnarled rhododendron trees, twenty or thirty feet high, rooting in clefts and hollows, were in flower (carmine red) all round the top of the rock. No snow ever falls here, they say; but there are sometimes hoar frosts, which the natives mistake for snow. I don’t suppose the temperature that night was below 50° Fahr., but it felt cold, very cold, after the heat of the lowlands. The sun rose soon after six, and at 7.30 we started downwards, on the great pilgrim-track towards Ratnapura. The final cone, for about 1, 500 feet, is certainly a steep bit of rock. I have seen it from several points of view, but the summit angle was always under 90°. Steps are cut nearly all down this part, and chains hang alongside in all places of possible difficulty—chains upon chains, things with links six inches long, all shapes and curiously wrought, centuries and centuries old—the pious gifts of successive generations of pilgrims. Here and there are long inscriptions, in Cinghalese characters, on the rock-faces; and everywhere signs of innumerable labor of successive travelers in hewing and shaping the path all the way—not to mention resting-sheds and cabins built in convenient spots lower down. These however are largely fallen to decay; and indeed the whole place gives one the impression that the sripada has come somewhat68 into disrepute in these modern times, and is only supported by the poorer and more ignorant among the people.",
        "target_summary": "The narrator observes a \"glory\"—a white light around one's own shadow on dew-covered grass—explaining it as a reflection of sunlight off water droplets. This phenomenon, which he notes is not unique to Adam's Peak, is personal; only the individual can see it around their own head, a fact he once used to playfully mislead a Positivist.\n\nAt the summit, the \"sripada\" (sacred foot) is a natural, oblong rock depression about five feet long, somewhat resembling a foot, though \"improved\" with mortared tiles. It sits on a tiny platform under a windswept pavilion, surrounded by bronze lotus lamps, a bell, a shrine, and a hut where lean priests huddled around a fire, appearing to live austerely. The priests, however, were notably greedy. The narrator also witnessed \"Caliban\" perform a poojah ritual at the shrine, involving frankincense, camphor, saltpetre, and scented water burned on an ember.\n\nAround the summit, ancient, gnarled carmine rhododendron trees bloomed. Although no snow falls, hoarfrosts occur, and despite temperatures around 50°F, it felt very cold. They began their descent on the steep pilgrim track towards Ratnapura. This path is carved with steps and features centuries-old chains, pious gifts from generations of pilgrims, and Cinghalese inscriptions. Many of the resting sheds along the way are in decay, giving the impression that the sripada has fallen into disrepute in modern times, primarily supported by the poorer and less educated.",

        "content": "Ratnapura is only 150 feet or so above the sea; and for twenty-four miles the path to it from the summit—well-marked but single file—goes down over rocks and through vast woods, without coming to anything like a road. Nearly the whole, however, of this great descent of 7,000 feet is done in the first twelve miles to Palábaddala—a tiny hamlet at the very foot of the mountains—and I don’t know that I ever felt a descent so fatiguing as this one, partly no doubt owing to the experiences of the day and night before, and partly no doubt to the enervation produced by the climate and want of exercise; but the path itself is a caution, and the ascent of it must indeed be a pilgrimage, with its huge steps and strides from rock to rock and from tree-root to tree-root, and going, as it does, almost straight up and down the mountain side, without the long zigzags and detours by which in such cases the brunt is usually avoided. All the same it was very interesting; the upper jungle of rhododendrons, myrtles, and other evergreen foliage forming a splendid cover for elephants, and clothing the surrounding peaks and crags for miles in grey-green wrinkles and folds, with here and there open grassy spaces and glades and tumbling watercourses; then the vegetation of the lower woods, huge trees 150 or even 200 feet high, with creepers, orchids, and tree-ferns; the occasional rush of monkeys along the branches; butterflies and birds; thick undergrowth in parts of daturas, pointsettias, crotons,69 and other fragrant and bright-colored shrubs; down at last into coco-nut plantations and to the lovely Kaluganga, or Black river, which we forded twice; and ultimately along its banks, shadowed by bamboos and many flowering trees. Although, curiously enough, the fig is not grown as a fruit in Ceylon, yet the ficus is one of the most important families of trees here, and many of the forest trees belong to it. There is one very handsome variety, whose massive grey stem rises unbroken to a great height before it branches, and which in order to support itself throws out great lateral wings or buttresses, reaching to a height of twelve or twenty feet from the ground, and spreading far out from the base of the trunk,—each buttress perhaps three or four inches thick, and perfectly shaped, with plane and parallel sides like a sawn plank, so as to give the utmost strength with least expenditure of material. This variety has small ovate evergreen leaves. Then there are two or three varieties, of which the banyan (ficus Indica) is one, which are parasitic in their habit. The banyan begins existence by its seed being dropped in the fork of another tree—not unfrequently a palm—from which point its rootlets make their way down the stem to the ground. With rapid growth it then encircles the victim tree, and throwing out great lateral branches sends down from these a rain of fresh rootlets which, after swinging in air for a few weeks, reach the ground and soon become sturdy pillars. I have thus seen a banyan encircling with its central trunk the stem of a palm, and clasping it so close that a knife could not be70 pushed between the two, while the palm, which had grown in height since this accident happened to it, was still soaring upwards, and feebly endeavoring to live. There is a very fine banyan tree at Kalutara, which spans the great high-road from Colombo to Galle, all the traffic passing beneath it and between its trunks. Some of the figs fasten parasitically on other trees, though without throwing out the pillar-like roots which distinguish the banyan; and it is not uncommon to see one of these with roots like a cataract of snakes winding round the trunk of an acacia, or even round some non-parasitic fig, the two trees appearing to be wrestling and writhing together in a fierce embrace, while they throw out their separate branches to sun and air, as though to gain strength for the fray. The parasite generally however ends by throttling its adversary.",
        "target_summary": "The challenging 7,000-foot descent to Ratnapura, primarily within the first twelve miles to Palábaddala, was extremely fatiguing. The path was unusually direct, featuring huge steps over rocks and tree-roots, rather than zigzags, making it feel like a pilgrimage. Despite the arduous nature, the journey was fascinating. It showcased diverse vegetation, starting with an upper jungle of rhododendrons, myrtles, and evergreens providing cover for elephants, amidst grey-green peaks and watercourses. Lower down, huge trees (150-200 feet tall) with creepers, orchids, and tree-ferns grew, alive with monkeys, butterflies, and birds. The undergrowth included fragrant daturas and poinsettias. The route concluded through coco-nut plantations, crossing the Kaluganga (Black river) twice, its banks shaded by bamboos and flowering trees.\n\nFicus trees are a significant family in Ceylon. One handsome variety has a massive, unbranched grey stem supported by impressive lateral buttresses, 12-20 feet high and perfectly shaped like planks, offering maximum strength. Other ficus varieties are parasitic, notably the banyan (Ficus Indica). It germinates in a host tree’s fork, sends roots to the ground, then encircles the host, developing sturdy pillar-like aerial roots from its branches. This process can tightly envelop a host, as exemplified by a banyan at Kalutara spanning a major highway. Other parasitic figs also entwine host trees with snake-like roots, creating a wrestling appearance as both trees vie for sun and air, though the parasite typically ends up throttling its adversary.",

        "content": "There is also the bo-tree, or ficus religiosa, whose leaf is of a thinner texture. One of the commonest plants in open spots all over Ceylon is the sensitive plant. Its delicately pinnate leaves form a bushy growth six inches to a foot in depth over the ground; but a shower of rain, or nightfall, or the trampling of animals through it causes it to collapse into a mere brown patch—almost as if a fire had passed over. In a few minutes however after the disturbance has ceased it regains its luxuriance. There are also some acacia trees which droop their leaves at nightfall, and at the advent of rain. There are two sorts of monkeys common in these forests—a small brown monkey, which may be seen swinging itself from tree to tree, not unfrequently71 with a babe in its arms; and the larger wanderoo monkey, which skips and runs on all fours along the ground, and of which it is said that its devotion to its mate is life-long. Very common all over Ceylon is a little grey-brown squirrel, with three yellow longitudinal stripes on its back; almost every tree seems to be inhabited by a pair, which take refuge there at the approach of a stranger, and utter a sharp little whistle like the note of an angry bird. They are very tame however, and will often in inhabited places run about the streets, or even make their appearance in the houses in search of food. The Hindus take no pleasure in killing animals—even the boys do not, as a rule, molest wild creatures—and the consequence is that birds and the smaller four-footed beasts are comparatively bold. Not that the animals are made pets of, but they are simply let alone—in keeping with the Hindu gentleness and quiescence of disposition. Even the deadly cobra—partly no doubt from religious associations—is allowed to go its way unharmed; and the people have generally a good word for it, saying it will not attack any one unless it be first injured. On the whole the trouble about reptiles in this country seems to me to be much exaggerated. There are some places in the forests where small leeches—particularly in the wet seasons—are a great pest. Occasionally a snake is to be seen, but I have been rather disappointed at their rarity; or a millipede nine inches long. The larger scorpion is a venomous-looking creature, with its blue-black lobster-like body and claws, and slender sting-surmounted72 tail, five inches long in all; but it is not so venomous as generally supposed, and most of these creatures, like the larger animals—the chetah, the elk, the bear, the elephant, etc.—keep out of the way of man as well as they can. Of course native woodmen and others tramping bare-legged through the tangles occasionally tread on a snake and get bitten; but the tale of deaths through such casualties, though it may seem numerically large, taken say throughout Ceylon and India, is in proportion to the population but a slight matter—about 1 in 15, 000 per annum. There are many handsome butterflies here, especially of the swallow-tail sort—some of enormous size—and a number of queer insects. I saw a large green mantis, perhaps six inches long—a most wicked-looking creature. I confess it reminded me of a highly respectable British property owner. It sits up like a beautiful green leaf, with its two foreclaws (themselves flattened out and green to look like lesser leaves) held up as if it were praying—perfectly motionless—except that all the time it rolls its stalked eyes slowly around, till it sees a poor little insect approach, when it stealthily moves a claw, and pounces. The birds are not so numerous as I expected. There are some bright-colored kinds and a few parrots, but the woods seem quiet on the whole. The barbet, a green bird not quite so big as a pigeon, goes on with its monotonous bell-like call—like a cuckoo that has lost its second note—on and on, the whole day long; the lizards cluck and kiss, full of omens to the natives, who call them “the73 crocodile’s little brothers”—and say “if you kill a little lizard the crocodile will come and kill you”; the grasshoppers give three clicks and a wheeze; the small grey squirrels chirrup; the frogs croak; and the whole air is full of continuous though subdued sound.",
        "target_summary": "Ceylon's environment features diverse flora and fauna. The bo-tree (ficus religiosa) has a thin-textured leaf. The sensitive plant, common in open areas, forms a bushy ground cover of delicate pinnate leaves. It collapses into a mere brown patch when disturbed by rain, nightfall, or trampling, but quickly regains its luxuriance. Some acacia trees also droop their leaves at night or during rain.\n\nTwo types of monkeys are common: a small brown monkey often seen swinging with an infant, and the larger wanderoo monkey, which runs on all fours and is known for lifelong devotion to its mate. A small grey-brown squirrel with three yellow stripes is ubiquitous, with almost every tree housing a pair. They take refuge and utter a sharp whistle when strangers approach, yet are quite tame, appearing in streets and houses for food.\n\nThis tameness is attributed to the Hindu disposition; they do not kill animals, and even boys generally avoid molesting wild creatures, allowing birds and small mammals to be comparatively bold. Animals are not kept as pets, but simply left undisturbed, reflecting Hindu gentleness. Even the deadly cobra, partly due to religious associations, is allowed to go unharmed, with people believing it only attacks if first injured. The author finds the perceived trouble with reptiles in Ceylon largely exaggerated.\n\nWhile small leeches can be a significant pest in some forest areas, especially during wet seasons, snakes are surprisingly rare, to the author's disappointment. Millipedes up to nine inches long are occasionally seen. The larger scorpion, a five-inch creature with a blue-black, lobster-like body, claws, and slender sting-tail, appears venomous but is not as dangerous as commonly believed. Most creatures, including larger animals like cheetahs, elephants, and bears, actively avoid humans. Although native woodmen occasionally step on snakes and get bitten, the resulting death toll, when considered across Ceylon and India relative to population, is slight—about 1 in 15,000 per annum.\n\nThe country boasts many handsome butterflies, including enormous swallow-tails, and various peculiar insects. The author describes a six-inch green mantis that looked \"wicked,\" sitting like a leaf with flattened green foreclaws held in a praying posture. Its stalked eyes constantly roll until it spots prey, then it stealthily pounces.\n\nBirds are less numerous than expected, with some bright-colored varieties and a few parrots, but the woods remain generally quiet. The barbet, a green bird about the size of a pigeon, maintains a monotonous, bell-like call throughout the day. Lizards cluck and kiss, holding omens for natives who call them \"the crocodile’s little brothers\" and believe killing one will invite a crocodile's wrath. The air is filled with continuous, albeit subdued, sounds: grasshoppers' three clicks and a wheeze, small grey squirrels' chirps, and frogs' croaks.",

Here we stopped two hours at a little cabin. Good people and friendly—a father and mother and two lads—the same anxious, tender mother-face that is the same all over the world. They brought out a kind of couch for me to lie on, but would not at first believe that I would eat their food. However, after a little persuasion they made some tea (for the people are beginning to use tea quite freely) and some curry and rice—quite palatable. I began to eat of course with my fingers, native fashion; but as soon as I did so, they saw that something was wrong, and raised a cry of Karandi! (spoon); and a boy was sent off, despite my protests, to the cabin of a rich neighbor half a mile off, and ultimately returned in triumph with a rather battered German-silver teaspoon! I felt doubtful about doing another twelve miles to Ratnapura; however thought best to try, and off we went. But the rest had done little good, and I could not go more than two miles an hour. At 4 p.m., after walking about four miles, we came out into flat land—a good path, little villages with clumps of palm and banana, lovely open meadows, 74 and tame buffalos grazing. Thence along the side of the Kaluganga, most lovely of rivers, through thickets of bamboo and tangles of shrubs, and past more hamlets and grazing grounds (though feeling so done, I thoroughly enjoyed every step of the way), till at last at a little kind of shop (kadai) we halted, about 6 p.m. Got more tea, and a few bananas, which was all I cared to eat; and then went in and lay down on a trestle and mat for an hour, after which we decided to stay the night. Kalua stretched himself near me; the men of the place lay down on the floor—the women somewhere inside; the plank shutters were built in, and lights put out. I slept fairly well, and woke finally at the sound of voices and with dawn peeping in through the holes in the roof. Had a lovely wash in a little stream, and an early breakfast of tea, bananas, and hot cakes made of rice, coco-nut, and sugar—and then walked four miles into this place (Ratnapura), where at last we came to a road and signs of civilisation. The rest-house here is comfortable; have had another bath, and a good solid breakfast, and made arrangements for a boat to start with us this evening down the river to Kalutara (60 miles). Sunday, Jan. 4th.—After walking round the town yesterday, and getting fruit and provisions for our voyage, we embarked about 6 p.m., and are now floating lazily down the Kaluganga.

The town derives its name from the trade in precious stones which has been carried on here for long enough—rubies, sapphires, and others being found over a great part of the mountain district. In perhaps half the little shops of Ratnapura men and boys may be seen squatted on the floor grinding and polishing jewels. With one hand they use a bow to turn their wheels, and with the other they hold the stone in position. The jewels are also set and offered for sale—often at what seem very low prices. But the purchaser must beware; for the blessings of modern commerce are with us even here, and many of these precious stones are bits of stained glass supplied wholesale from Birmingham. This boat, which is of a type common on the river, consists of two canoes or “dug-outs,” each twenty feet long, and set five or six feet apart from each other, with a flooring laid across them, and a little thatched cabin constructed amidships. The cabin is for cooking and sleeping—a fire and cooking pots at one end, and mats laid at the other. At the front end of the boat sit the two rowers, and the steersman stands behind.

        "content": "Hardly any signs of habitation along the river. Now and then rude steps down to the shore, and a dark figure pouring water on its own head. The river varying, a hundred yards, more or less, wide. At about seven it got too dark and we halted against a sandbank, waiting for the moon to rise, and had dinner—rice, curried eggs, and beans, and a pineapple—very good. Then got out and sat on the sand, while the boys lighted a fire. Very fine, the gloom on the tall fringed banks, gleams from the fire, voices of children far back among the woods,77 playing in some village. After a time we went back on board again, and sat round teaching each other to count, and laughing at our mistakes—ekkai, dekkai, tonai, hattarai—one, two, three, four. The Cinghalese language (unlike the Tamil) is full of Aryan roots—minya, man; gáni, woman; and so on. The small boy Thoránis (12 years) learnt his “one two three” in no time; he is pretty sharp; he does the cooking, and prepares our meals, taking an oar between times. The man Pedri seemed good to the lads, and they all enjoyed themselves till they got sleepy and lay in a row and snored. Started again at moonrise, about midnight; after which I went to sleep till six or so, then went ashore and had a bath—water quite warm. Then off again; a few slight rapids, but nothing much. We go aground every now and then; but these boats are so tough—the canoes themselves being hollowed trees—that a bump even on a rock does not seem to matter much. The lads quite enjoy the struggle getting over a sandbank, and Duánis jumps down from his perch and plunges through the water with evident pleasure. The old man Djayánis steers—a shrewd-faced calm thin fellow, almost like a North American Indian, but no beak. See a monkey or a kite occasionally; no crocodiles in this part of the river, above the rapids; some large and handsome kingfishers, and the fruit-crow, whose plumage is something like that of a pheasant. Kalua enjoys the voyage. It suits his lazy sociable temperament, and he chats away to Pedri and the crew no end. His savage strength and insouciance are splendid. All over Adam’s Peak he walked78 barefoot, with no more sign of fatigue than if it had been a walk round a garden,—would lie down and sleep anywhere, or not sleep, eat or not eat, endure cold or heat with apparent indifference; yet though so complete a savage physically, it is interesting to see what an attraction for him civilisation, or the little he has seen of it, exerts. He is always asking me about Europe, and evidently dreaming about its wealth and splendor. All the modern facilities and inventions are sort of wonderful toys to this child of nature; and though I think he is attached to me, and is no doubt of an affectionate disposition, still it is partly that I am mixed up in his mind with all these things. I tried one day to find out from K. his idea of god or devil, or supreme power of any kind; but in vain. His mind wandered to things more tangible. Many of the Cinghalese however have rather a turn for speculations of this kind; and at one hotel where I was staying the chamber-servant entertained me with quite a discourse on Buddha, and ended by ridiculing the Christian idea that a man can get rid of the results of sin by merely praying to God or believing in Jesus. We have now passed the nárraka-gála (bad rock) rapid, which is about half-way down the river, and is the only rapid which has looked awkward, the river narrowing to five or six yards between rocks, and plunging over at a decided slope. We went through with a great bump, but no damage! The sun and smells on board are getting rather trying; this dried-fish smell unfortunately haunts one wherever there are native cabins. But we shall not be79 long now before reaching my landing-place, a little above Kalutara. There are a good many boats like ours on the river, some laden with rice going down, others poling upwards—sometimes whole families on the move. Quantities of ragged white lilies fringing the shore. Jan. 6th.—Kalua and I left our friends and their boat in the afternoon, and spent Sunday night at P——’s bungalow. P. is manager of a tea plantation—a bit of a Robinson Crusoe, living all by himself—native servants of course—with two dogs, a cat, and a jackdaw (and at one time a hare!) sharing his meals. Some of these planter-fellows must find the life a little dreary I fancy, living isolated on their plantations at a considerable distance from European neighbors, with very small choice of society at the best, and prevented no doubt by their position from associating too closely with the only folk who are near them—their own employees. The more kindly-hearted among them however do a good deal for their workers in the way of physicking and nursing them when ill or disabled, advising them when in difficulties, etc.; and in these cases the natives, with their instinct of dependence, soon learn to lean like children on their employer, and the latter finds himself, after a few years, the father (so to speak) of a large family. There are 200 Tamil coolies permanently employed on this plantation, and a hundred or two besides, mostly girls and women, who come in to work when wanted from neighboring Cinghalese villages.",

The sharp 12-year-old Thoránis, who also cooked and rowed, quickly learned.\n\nThe trip resumed at moonrise around midnight. After sleeping, the narrator had a warm-water bath ashore. They encountered minor rapids and frequent groundings, but the tough, hollowed-tree canoes withstood bumps, with lads like Duánis enjoying the exertion. Djayánis, a shrewd and calm steersman, guided the boat. Wildlife included occasional monkeys, kites, handsome kingfishers, and fruit-crows, but no crocodiles in this upper section.\n\nKalua, sociable and physically resilient, thrived on the voyage, chatting animatedly with the crew. Despite his ability to endure physical hardship with indifference, he was captivated by \"civilization,\" constantly questioning the narrator about Europe's wealth and modern inventions, perceiving the narrator as linked to these wonders. While Kalua showed no interest in abstract concepts of God, some Cinghalese held such discussions, like a chamber-servant who critiqued the Christian idea of sin remission.\n\nThey successfully navigated the \"nárraka-gála\" rapid, the river's most challenging section where it narrowed dramatically. The persistent smell of dried fish from native cabins was a drawback, but their landing spot near Kalutara was approaching. The river was busy with other boats, including those carrying rice or poling upstream, and its shores were lined with white lilies.\n\nOn January 6th, the narrator and Kalua left the boat to stay at P.'s isolated bungalow. P., a tea plantation manager, lived like a \"Robinson Crusoe\" with native servants and several pets. The text reflects on the potential dreariness of isolated planter life, far from European peers and socially separated from their employees. However, many planters kindly provided care and advice to their dependent native workers, often becoming paternal figures.

        "content": "But the system, like the commercial system wherever it is found to-day, is pretty bad and odious in80 itself, and is no doubt in many cases a cover for shameful abuses. The Tamil coolies—men, women, and children—come over in gangs from the mainland of India. An agent is sent out to tout for them, and to conduct them by sea and land to their destination. On their arrival on the tea-estate each one finds himself so many rupees in debt for the expenses of transit! An average wage is 6d. a day, but to keep them up to the mark in productiveness their work is “set” for them to complete a certain task in a certain time, and if they do not come up to their task they get only half pay; so that if a man is slow, or lazy,81 or ill, he may expect about 3d. per diem! Under these circumstances the debt, as may be imagined, goes on increasing instead of diminishing; the estate is far up country, away from town or village, and the tea company acts as agent and sells rice and the other necessaries of life to its own coolies. Poor things, they cannot buy elsewhere. “Oh, but they like to be in debt,” said a young planter to me, “and think they are not doing the best for themselves unless they owe as much as the company will allow.” He was very young, that planter, and perhaps did not realise what he was saying; but what a suggestion of despair! Certainly there may have been some truth in the remark; for when all hope of ever being out of debt is gone, the very next best thing is to be in debt, as much as ever you can. At the end of the week the coolie does not see any wage; his rice, etc., has forestalled all that, and more; only his debt is ticked down a little deeper. If he runs away to a neighboring estate he is soon sent back in irons. He is a slave, and must remain so to the end of his days. That is not very long however; for poor food and thin clothing, and the mists and cool airs of the mountains soon bring on lung diseases, of which the slight-bodied Tamil easily dies. “I dare say 3d. a day seems a very small wage to you,” said the planter youth, “but it is really surprising how little these fellows will live on.” “It is surprising, indeed, when you see their thin frames, that they live at all.” “Ah, but they are much worse off at home; you should see them when they come from India.” And so the conversation ended. 82 And this is how our tea, which we set so much store by, is produced in Ceylon and other places. These plantations are sad-looking places. Commercialism somehow has a way of destroying all natural beauty in those regions where it dwells. Here the mountain sides are torn up, the immense and beautiful forests ravaged from base to summit, and the shaly escarpments that remain planted in geometrical lines with tea-shrubs. You may walk for miles through such weary lands, extending rapidly now all over the mountain region from the base to near the tops of the highest mountains, the blackened skeletons of half-burnt trees alone remaining to tell of the old forests, of which before long there will be but a memory left. It is curious, when one comes to think of it, that such huge spaces of the earth are devastated, such vast amounts of human toil expended, in the production of two things—tea and wine—which to say the least are not necessaries, and which certainly in the quantities commonly consumed are actually baneful. If their production simply ceased, what a gain it might seem! Yet the commercial policies of the various nations stimulate these, and always to the neglect of the necessaries of life. They stimulate the stimulants. We need not be hypercritical, but there must be something peculiar in the temper of the modern nations that they make such tremendous sacrifices in order to act in this way.",
        "target_summary": "The commercial system operating in tea plantations is deeply exploitative and rife with abuses. Tamil coolies, including men, women, and children, are recruited from India and immediately fall into debt for their travel expenses upon reaching the estate. They earn a low average wage of 6d per day, but this is contingent on completing demanding \"set tasks\" within a strict timeframe. Failure to meet these tasks, regardless of reasons like slowness, laziness, or illness, results in only half pay (3d daily), ensuring their initial debt steadily increases rather than diminishes.\n\nThese coolies are further trapped by the remote location of the estates, which makes the tea company their sole supplier of rice and other necessities, deepening their debt through monopolistic pricing. A young planter's naive assertion that coolies \"like to be in debt\" is interpreted by the author as a tragic sign of despair; for those with no hope of escaping debt, maximizing it might seem like the only alternative. Weekly wages are entirely consumed by these purchases, with any remainder merely ticking their debt deeper. Attempts to flee to neighboring estates result in forced returns, often in irons, cementing their status as lifetime slaves. Their lives are tragically short, as poor food, inadequate clothing, and the harsh mountain climate quickly lead to fatal lung diseases among the slight-bodied Tamils. The planter's callous observation that these workers \"live on very little\" highlights the extreme hardship.\n\nBeyond human exploitation, tea production, particularly in regions like Ceylon, causes immense environmental destruction. Beautiful forests are ravaged, mountainsides are torn up, and the natural landscape is replaced by geometrically planted tea shrubs. Miles of these \"weary lands\" now stretch across mountain regions, leaving behind only \"blackened skeletons of half-burnt trees\" as a testament to the disappearing ancient forests. The author questions the \"peculiar temper\" of modern nations that devote vast land and human toil to produce non-essential, and even \"baneful,\" goods like tea and wine, stimulating these \"stimulants\" through commercial policies while neglecting the true necessities of life.",

In Ceylon the plucking goes on almost all the year round. As soon as the young shoots, with five or six leaves, have had time to form since the last plucking, a gang of workers comes round—mostly girls and women for this job—each with a basket, into which they pluck the young leaves and the little rolled-up leaf-bud, most precious of all. When taken to the factory the leaves are first spread out to wither,84 then rolled by machinery (to look like buds), then dried or baked by artificial heat. After this they are sorted through a huge sieve, and the finest quality, consisting of the small leaf-bud, is called Flowery Pekoe; the next size, including some of the young leaf, is called Broken Pekoe; and the coarser leaves come out as Pekoe Souchong, Souchong, etc. The difficulty with tea, as with wine, is that no two yields are alike; the conditions of plucking, fermenting, firing, etc., all make a difference in the resultant flavor. Hence a dealer, say in London, who reckons to supply his customers with tea of a certain constant flavor, has simply to make such tea as best he can—namely by “blending” any teas which he can lay hold of in the market, and which will produce the desired result. The names given in these cases are of course mostly fictitious.",

        "content": "I may as well insert here one or two extracts from letters since received from our friend “Ajax,” which will perhaps help to show the condition of the coolies in the tea-gardens where he is now working. He says:— “One gets very fond of the coolies, they are so much like children; they bring all their little grievances to one to settle. A man will come and complain that his wife refuses to cook his food for him; the most minute details of family affairs are settled by the sahib of the garden. The coolies have a hard time, and are treated little better than slaves; most willing workers they are. Still all I can say is that they have a much better time than the very poor at home, such as the factory girls, tailoresses, 85 etc., and laborers. On this garden they have met with exceptionally hard lines; the manager being an ill-bred man has had no consideration for his men, and they have died in hundreds from exposure to weather in the garden and houses, which had all crumbled away from neglect. Many families of ten or eleven in number have dwindled away to one or two. In one case, two little fellows of eight and nine, living together on five rupees a month, are the only representatives (of a former family).... “I was sorry to leave (the former garden), very; I had got to know the coolies, 300 of them at any rate who were under my charge, and they had got to know me. Many of them wanted to come with me here, but that is not allowed. Some said they would ‘cut their names,’ that is take their names off the garden labor-register, and go wherever I went, but of course they could not do that. I don’t know why they were so anxious to come, because I know I worked them very hard all the time I was there. I think my predecessor used to fine them and thrash them a good deal, often because he did not know what they said, and could not make them understand. I like the coolies very much, and one gets quite attached to some of them; they seem instinctively polite; and if you are ill, they tend you just like a woman—never leave one in fact. The higher and more respectable class of Baboos are just as objectionable, I think.”",
        "target_summary": "In letters, \"Ajax\" describes the coolies in tea-gardens as childlike, bringing all their grievances, even minor family issues, to the sahib for resolution. He notes their challenging lives, where they are treated little better than slaves despite being willing workers, yet considers their conditions superior to the very poor in England, such as factory girls or laborers. His current garden is particularly harsh due to an ill-bred manager's neglect, which has led to hundreds of deaths from exposure caused by crumbling housing and poor garden conditions. Consequently, many large families have dwindled to one or two survivors, including an instance of two young boys, aged eight and nine, who now live alone on five rupees a month.\n\nAjax expresses sadness about leaving his previous garden, where he had formed connections with the 300 coolies under his charge. Many were so attached they wanted to follow him, even suggesting illegally removing their names from the labor-register, which was not permitted. Ajax found this desire surprising, given he worked them very hard, but theorizes it contrasted with his predecessor, who often fined and thrashed them due to misunderstandings. Ajax personally holds a strong affection for the coolies, finding them instinctively polite and caring, as they tend to him like family when he is ill. He contrasts this positive view with his opinion that the \"higher and more respectable class of Baboos are just as objectionable.\"",

        "content": "Kurunégala.—I have come to the conclusion that the courts and judicial proceedings out here are a kind of entertainment provided for the oysters at the expense of the British Government, and that the people really look upon these institutions very much in that light. Poor things! their ancient communal life and interests, with all the local questions and politics which belonged thereto, and even to a great extent the religious festivals, have been improved away; they have but few modern joys—no votes and elections such as would delight our friend Monerasingha—no circuses, theatres, music-halls. What is there left for them but the sensations of the police-courts? The district court here is, I find, the one great centre of interest in the town. Crowds collect in the early morning, and hang about all day in its vicinity, either watching the cases or discussing the judgments delivered, till sunset, when they disperse homeward again. Cooling drinks are sold, beggars ply their trade, the little bullock-hackeries trot up and down, and the place is as busy as a fair. There is no particular stigma in conviction by an alien authority; there is a happy uncertainty in the judgments delivered by the representatives of a race that has difficulty in understanding the popular87 customs and language; and the worst that can happen—namely relegation to prison life—affords a not unpleasant prospect. Besides, these institutions can be used to gratify personal spleen; cases can be, and frequently are, cooked up in the most elaborate manner. Damages can be claimed for a fictitious assault; and when an injury has really been done, the plaintiff (and this I find is a constantly recurring difficulty) will accuse not only the author of the mischief, but Tom, Dick, and Harry besides, who have had nothing whatever to do with it, but who are the objects of personal spite, in the hope of getting them too into trouble. The Cinghalese, as I have said before, are a very sensitive people. Any grievance rankles in their bosom, and in revenge they will not unfrequently use the knife. An Eurasian friend, a doctor, says that he quite thinks cases88 might occur in which a man who had been wounded or assaulted by another would die out of spite in order to get the other hanged!—would connive with his relations and starve himself, and not try to heal the wound. He says however that the cases of ruptured spleen—of which we so frequently hear—are genuine, as frequent fevers often cause immense enlargement of the spleen, which then bursts for a comparatively slight cause, e.g. a planter and a stick.",
        "target_summary": "The author concludes that British judicial proceedings in Kurunégala function primarily as entertainment for the local populace. With their traditional communal life and festivals dismantled and a lack of modern diversions like elections or theatres, the police courts offer a significant source of sensation.\n\nThe district court is the town's main attraction, drawing crowds who gather all day to watch and discuss cases, creating a bustling, fair-like atmosphere. Locals find appeals in this system: conviction by an alien authority carries no stigma, judgments are happily uncertain due to cultural and linguistic misunderstandings, and even prison is not viewed negatively.\n\nConsequently, courts are often exploited to gratify personal vendettas. Elaborate false cases are fabricated, and in genuine disputes, plaintiffs frequently accuse innocent individuals out of spite alongside the actual perpetrators. The sensitive Cinghalese, prone to nursing grievances, often resort to violence. A doctor even posits that a wounded man might intentionally die, refusing treatment, out of sheer spite to ensure his assailant's execution. However, the frequently reported cases of ruptured spleens are genuine, often resulting from spleens enlarged by frequent fevers, which then burst from comparatively slight impacts.",

        "content": "The courts in this country are generally large thatched or tiled halls, sometimes with glass sides, but often open to the wind, with only a low wall running round, over which, as you sit inside, a crowd of bare arms and heads and bodies appears. At one end sits the English official, dutifully but wearily going through his task, a big punkah waving over his head and helping to dispel the slumbrous noontide heat; below him stands the mudaliar, who acts as interpreter—for the etiquette properly enough requires that the transactions of the court shall be given in both languages, even though the official be a native or an Englishman knowing the native language perfectly; at the table in the centre are seated a few reporters and proctors, and at the other end are the prisoners in the dock, and the policemen in their boots. The cases are largely quarrels, and more or less unfounded accusations arising out of quarrels, thefts of bullocks or of coco-nuts, and so forth. The chief case when I was in court some days ago was rather amusing. A few days before, three or four men, having been accused, possibly wrongfully, of burglary, and having (on account of insufficient89 evidence) been acquitted, went off straight from the court to an arrack shop and got drunk. They then made it up between them that they would rob the man thoroughly that evening, even if they had not done so before, and give him a good hiding into the bargain; and taking to themselves some other congenial spirits went off on their errand. They found the man asleep in the verandah of his cabin, and tying him down gave him some blows. But—as it came out in the evidence with regard to the very slight marks on the body—before they could have hurt him much, the man, with great presence of mind, died, and left them charged with the crime of murder! An old woman—the man’s mother—with a beautiful face, but shaking with age, came forward to give evidence. She said she was nearly 100 years old, though the evidence on this point was not very clear. Anyhow, her head was remarkably clear, and she gave her testimony well; identified several of the prisoners, said they had broken into the cabin and carried off valuables, and that one, the leader, had motioned her into a corner of the cabin, saying, “Stand aside, old mother, or you’ll get hurt,” while another had come up to her and said, “I think I had better take those bangles from you, as they are no good to you now, you know.” There were nine men charged with the offence, and they were committed for trial in a higher court—very decent-looking scaramouches on the whole, just about average types of humanity. The English officials that I have seen here and at other places strike me as remarkably good-hearted painstaking men; but one feels the gulf between90 them and the people—a gulf that can never be bridged. Practically all that a Government like ours does, or can do, is to make possible the establishment of our social institutions in the midst of an alien people—our railways, education, Bible missions, hospitals, law-courts, wage-slavery, and profit-grinding, and all the rest of it, in the midst of a people whose whole life springs from another root, namely religious feeling. The two will never blend, though the shock produced by the contact of two such utterly different civilisations may react on both, to the production of certain important results. Anyhow for a well-meaning official it must be depressing work; for though he may construct a valuable tank, or what not, from the highest motives according to his own lights—i.e. for the material welfare of the people and the realisation of a five per cent. profit to Government—still he never comes near touching the hearts of the millions, who would probably pay much more respect to a half-luny yogi than to him and all his percentages. A.’s friend, Sámanáthan, comes to read English with me every day, and teaches me a little Tamil in return. He is something of a dandy, with his green silk coat and hair plaited down his back, and delicate hands and manners—a fellow over thirty, with a wife and children, and yet not earning any livelihood, but remaining on at home with his parents, and dependent on them! And what seems to us most strange, this is quite an admitted and natural thing to do—such is the familiar communism which still prevails. He is very much of a student by nature, and in his native town (in India) gives lectures, 91 philosophical and theological, free of charge, and which are quite popular. He is reading S. Mark with me, and reads it pretty well, being evidently familiar even with the more philosophical words, though doubtful about the pronunciation of some. He is interested in the story of Jesus, and thinks Jesus was no doubt a “sage”—i.e. an adept—or at any rate versed in the arcane lore of the East. But he is much amused at the Christian doctrine of the redemption, which I suppose he has got hold of, not from Mark but the missionaries.",
        "target_summary": "Colonial courts are typically open, thatched or tiled halls where an English official presides, assisted by a mudaliar interpreter. Reporters and proctors sit centrally, while prisoners are in the dock. Cases often involve quarrels or minor thefts.\n\nA peculiar case involved men previously acquitted of burglary who, after getting drunk, decided to genuinely rob and assault their accuser. They tied him and inflicted blows, but the man died with \"great presence of mind\" before sustaining significant harm, leading to a murder charge. The victim's nearly 100-year-old mother, despite her age, provided clear testimony, identifying the nine prisoners and detailing the robbery, including threats and the theft of her bangles. These average-looking men were committed for trial in a higher court.\n\nThe author observes that English officials, though good-hearted and painstaking, encounter an \"unbridgeable gulf\" with the native populace. British social institutions like railways, education, and law courts are imposed on a people whose life is rooted in religious feeling, not material welfare or profit. This fundamental cultural disparity makes the officials' well-intentioned work depressing, as their efforts fail to connect deeply with the millions, who might value a yogi more than government initiatives.\n\nThe author's friend, Sámanáthan, is a dandyish, educated man over thirty, married with children, yet financially dependent on his parents—a common practice of \"familiar communism.\" He gives popular, free philosophical and theological lectures.

        "content": "On the 10th of this month (January), F. Modder and I went off on an excursion from here to Dambulla (35 miles), and thence to Anurádhapura (42 miles). Dambulla is celebrated for its Buddhist rock-temples, and Anurádhapura is the site of a very ancient city, now in ruins amid the jungle. Despite all sorts of reports about the length of the journey and its difficulty—the chief difficulty being that of getting any exact information—M. managed to secure a bullock-cart with springs, and two pairs of bullocks; and we made a start about 6.30 p.m. A mattress in the cart and a pillow or two made all comfortable. We sat and talked for a couple of hours, then walked, and then went to sleep. With an average speed of two miles an hour we reached the rest-house at Gokarella at midnight, changed bulls, and immediately went on. Another six hours brought us to the house of a Government medical practitioner—a Cinghalese—where we got an early breakfast, and finally we reached Dr. Devos’ house, at Dambulla, about midday. The little bulls went patiently on during the night, the Tamil driver chirruping “Jack” and “Pitta” to them (corresponding to our carters’ “Orve” and “Gee,”) which some cheerful English traveler is said to have interpreted into the statement that the natives of Ceylon call all their cattle either Jack or Peter; the stars shone bright—the Milky Way innumerable. The road was bad, with occasional descents into dry sandy torrent beds; jungle stretched all around (with here and there, M. says, the remains of some town buried in undergrowth); but we slept—M. slept, I slept, the driver slept, and occasionally even the good little bulls slept. Once or twice we came thus to a total stoppage, all sleeping, and then woke up at the unwonted quiet. Just the first light of dawn, and a few strange93 bird-calls in the bush; the great ficus trees with their mighty buttresses stretching white stems up into the yet ghostly light; ant-hills, conical and spired, all along the road-side; tangles of creepers, and then, as the sun rose, quantities of butterflies. I know nothing of butterflies, but the kinds in this country are very various and beautiful. There is one which is very common, about four inches across, black and white, with body a bright red, and underwing spotted with the same colour—very handsome; and one day, when taking a sun-bath in the woods, an immense swallow-tail hovered round me, fully ten inches across from tip to tip of wings. Modder is a cheerful fellow, of Dutch descent probably, of about thirty years of age, a proctor or solicitor for native cases, well up in Cinghalese and Tamil, and full of antiquarian knowledge, yet can troll a comic song nicely with a sweet voice. I find he is a regular democrat, and hates the whole caste system in which he lives embedded—thinks the U.S. must be “a glorious country.” He says he has often talked to the Tamil and Cinghalese people about the folly of caste. At first they can’t understand what he means—are completely at a loss to imagine anything different, but after a time the idea seems to take hold on them.",
        "target_summary": "On January 10th, the narrator and F. Modder embarked on an excursion from their location, traveling 35 miles to Dambulla, famous for its Buddhist rock-temples, and then a further 42 miles to Anurádhapura, an ancient city now in ruins within the jungle. Despite reports of the journey's length and difficulty, particularly in obtaining accurate information, Modder secured a comfortable bullock-cart with springs and two pairs of bullocks.\n\nThey departed around 6:30 p.m., initially talking and then walking before settling down to sleep in the cart. Maintaining an average speed of two miles per hour, they reached the Gokarella rest-house at midnight, changed bulls, and continued immediately. After another six hours, they had an early breakfast at the home of a Cinghalese Government medical practitioner, finally arriving at Dr. Devos’ house in Dambulla around midday. The overnight journey featured patient bulls guided by a Tamil driver, a bright starry sky revealing the Milky Way, and a challenging road with occasional sandy torrent beds. Dense jungle stretched around them, occasionally concealing the remains of ancient towns. The travelers, driver, and even the bulls frequently slept, sometimes leading to brief, quiet stoppages.\n\nDawn broke with distinct bird-calls and revealed imposing ficus trees with mighty buttresses, conical ant-hills lining the road, and tangles of creepers. As the sun rose, numerous varied and beautiful butterflies appeared. The narrator noted a common four-inch black and white butterfly with a bright red body and spotted underwings, and a magnificent ten-inch swallow-tail that once hovered nearby.\n\nF. Modder, a cheerful man of about thirty, likely of Dutch descent, was a proctor for native cases. Fluent in Cinghalese and Tamil, he possessed extensive antiquarian knowledge and could sing comic songs pleasantly. Described as a democrat, Modder strongly disliked the caste system, viewing it as folly. He admired the U.S. and often discussed the irrationality of caste with local Tamil and Cinghalese people, who initially struggled to comprehend an alternative but eventually seemed to grasp the idea.",

        "content": "Found Devos at Dambulla—a fine clear-faced man of about thirty-three, genuine, easy-going, carrying on a hospital in this slightly populated district—just a large native village, no more—but the mails come through this way, and a few English on their way to Anurádhapura, and other places. Gangs of Tamil coolies also, from the mainland of94 India, pass through Dambulla in going up country, and have to be medically examined here, for fear of cholera, etc. Living with Devos are two younger fellows, Percy Carron, who is also an Eurasian, and a Cinghalese youth, both foresters—a small easy-going bachelors’ household, and all very chummy together. Thought they also treated their Tamil “boy” John well—actually called him by his name, and did not shout at him. These fellows all talk English among themselves, in a close-lipped, rapid, rather neat way. The other two chaffed the Cinghalese a good deal, who was of the usual sensitive clinging type. In the afternoon we went up the rock to see the temples. A great rock, 500 or 600 feet high, similar to that at Kurunégala. Half-way up stretches a broad ledge, 100 yards long, commanding a fine view over hill and dale, and between this ledge and an overhanging layer of rock above are niched five temples all in a row. No façade to speak of, mere stucco walling, but within you pass into large caverns full of rude statues. The largest of the temples is 150 feet long, 40 deep, and 23 high in front—a great dark space with perhaps fifty colossal images of Buddha sitting round in the gloom with their sickly smile of Nirvana, and one huge figure, 30 or 40 feet long, lying down in illumined sleep; all crudely done, and painted bright yellows and reds, yet rather impressive. The sides too and roof of the cavern are frescoed in the same crude manner with stories from the life of Buddha, and with figures of the Hindu gods. Withal, a fusty smell, a thousand years old, of priests none too clean, of flaring95 oil-lamps, of withered flowers and stale incense, oppressed us horribly, and it was the greatest relief to get out again into the open. Devos says the scene is very striking at the great festivals, when multitudinous pilgrims assemble and offer their lights and their flowers and their money, on benches each before the figure they affect. Tomtoms beat, worshipers recite their prayers, lights twinkle, and outside the light of the full moon pours down upon the rock. Monkeys native to the rock are fed on this ledge in hundreds by the priests. Ceylon is of course mainly Buddhist, and all over the hilly part of the island rock-temples of this sort, though smaller, are scattered—some mere shrines with a single seated or recumbent image of Buddha. They are commonly built among the woods, under some overhanging brow of rock, and the story generally runs that the cavern had in earlier times been occupied by some hermit-saint, or yogi, and that the temple was built in remembrance of him. There is a little one of this kind half-way up the rock at Kurunégala, and it is tended by a boy priest of about thirteen years of age, who, barehead and barefoot, but with his yellow priest-robe wound gracefully about him, attends in a dignified manner to the service of the shrine. He is generally followed by a little attendant (every one has an attendant in the East)—a small boy of about nine—who turns out to be his khoki, or cook! This sounds luxurious, but by rule the Buddhist priests should live the most abstemious lives. They are supposed to have no money or possessions of their own, and to be entirely celibate. Each morning they go out96 with their begging bowls on their arm to get their daily food. They go to a house and stand near the door, asking nothing. Then presently the woman comes out and puts a little rice in the bowl, and the priest goes on to the next house. When he has got sufficient he returns, and his attendant cooks the food (if not already cooked) and he eats it. For each priest has the privilege to choose a boy or youth to be his attendant, whom he trains up to the priesthood, and who takes his place after him. This perhaps explains the presence of the small boy khoki above. The Buddhist priests, like the Hindu priests, are drawn mostly from the comparatively uneducated masses, but there is no need in their case that they should be Brahmans. A vast tolerance, and gentleness towards all forms of life, characterises the Buddhist institutions; but in the present day in Ceylon the institutions are decadent, and the priests, with a few exceptions, are an ignorant and incapable set. The efforts of Col. Olcott however, on behalf of the Theosophical Society, and of Sumángala, the present high priest of the island, a man of great learning and gentleness, have done something in latest years to infuse a new spirit into the Buddhism of Ceylon and to rehabilitate its esoteric side. At Kandy in one of the Buddhist temples outside the town there is a standing figure of Buddha twenty-seven feet high, carved in the face of the solid rock, and the temple built round it—rather fine—though with the usual crude red and yellow paint. It belongs to the time of the kings of Kandy, and is only about 150 years old. Many of the ordinary97 cave-temples are extremely old, however—as old as Buddhism in the island, 2, 000 years or more—and likely were used for religious purposes even before that.After looking at the Dambulla temples, which are said to have been constructed by the king Walagambahu about 100 B.C., we gained the summit of the rock, whence you have a view over plains towards the sea and of ranges of hills inland, not unlike that from the rock at Kurunégala; and then descended, not without difficulty, the precipitous side. Evening fell, and darkies came out with lamps to our aid. The same night I pushed on by mail-coach to Anurádhapura, leaving Modder behind, as he unfortunately had to return to Kurunégala the next day.",
        "target_summary": "The narrator encountered Devos, a genuine and easy-going thirty-three-year-old man, managing a hospital in Dambulla, Ceylon—a large native village that served as a significant transit point for mail, English travelers, and Tamil coolies from mainland India, who were medically examined for cholera. Devos shared an easy-going, \"chummy\" bachelors’ household with Percy Carron, an Eurasian forester, and a sensitive Cinghalese youth, also a forester. They conversed rapidly in English, often playfully \"chaffing\" the Cinghalese, and notably treated their Tamil \"boy\" John well, addressing him by name.\n\nIn the afternoon, they visited the Dambulla rock temples, situated halfway up a 500-600 foot high rock, similar to one at Kurunégala. A 100-yard ledge, offering fine views over the landscape, hosted five temples niched in a row beneath an overhanging rock. These temples, featuring simple stucco walls instead of grand façades, opened into expansive caverns. Inside, crude, brightly painted yellow and red statues depicted Buddha, including about fifty colossal sitting images and one huge 30-40 foot reclining Buddha in \"illumined sleep\" in the largest temple (150 feet long, 40 deep, and 23 high). The cavern walls and roof were frescoed with stories of Buddha and figures of Hindu gods. A pervasive, thousand-year-old \"fusty smell\" from priests, oil lamps, withered flowers, and stale incense was horribly oppressive, making their departure a great relief. Devos described the temple's striking atmosphere during festivals, with multitudinous pilgrims making offerings amid beating tomtoms, prayers, twinkling lights, and the full moon. Hundreds of native monkeys on the ledge were fed by priests.\n\nCeylon, being primarily Buddhist, features many similar, though smaller, rock temples throughout its hilly regions, often nestled in woods under rock brows. These shrines, sometimes housing a single Buddha image, were traditionally believed to have once been abodes for hermit-saints or yogis. An example at Kurunégala showcased a dignified, barefoot, yellow-robed 13-year-old boy priest, attended by his 9-year-old \"khoki\" (cook). Buddhist priests are mandated to live abstemious, celibate lives without personal wealth. Each morning, they silently collect their daily food by presenting begging bowls at houses, with their attendant later cooking the received rice. Priests typically train a boy or youth as an attendant to succeed them. While generally drawn from the uneducated masses and not requiring Brahman status (unlike Hindu priests), the author observed that current Buddhist institutions in Ceylon were decadent, with most priests being ignorant and incapable despite the religion's characteristic vast tolerance and gentleness. However, efforts by Col. Olcott of the Theosophical Society and Sumángala, the learned and gentle high priest, were working to revitalize Ceylonese Buddhism and rehabilitate its esoteric aspects. Another notable temple at Kandy, about 150 years old, houses a 27-foot standing Buddha carved into solid rock, built around it, though also crudely painted red and yellow. Many cave temples are far older, some over 2,000 years old, possibly predating Buddhism on the island, with the Dambulla temples specifically attributed to King Walagambahu around 100 B.C.\n\nAfter reaching the Dambulla summit for expansive views (again, not unlike those from Kurunégala), they descended the precipitous side with difficulty, aided by \"darkies\" with lamps as evening fell. The narrator then departed by mail-coach for Anurádhapura that evening, while Modder returned to Kurunégala.",

        "content": "The remains of this ancient city lie near the centre of the great plain which occupies the north end of the island of Ceylon. To reach them, even from Dambulla, the nearest outpost of civilisation, one has to spend a night in the “mail-coach,” which in this case consists of a clumsy little cart drawn at a jog-trot through the darkness by bullocks, and generally full of native passengers. Six times in the forty-two miles the little humped cattle are changed, and at last—by the time one has thoroughly convinced oneself that it is impossible to sleep in any attainable position—one finds oneself, about 6 a.m., driving through woods full of ruins. Here, on the site of a once vast and populous town, stands now a small village. The care of Government has cleared the jungle away from the most important remains and those lying just around the present site, so that the chief feature is a beautiful park-like region of grass and scattered trees, in which stand out scores, and even hundreds, of columns, with statues, huge dágobas, fragments of palaces, and innumerable evidences of ancient building. It is a remarkable scene. The present cutcherry stands on the shore of one of the large reservoirs which used to supply the city and neighborhood, 100 but which at present, owing to want of rain and deficiencies of channels, is nearly dry. On climbing the embankment the bed of the lake stretches before one, with hundreds of tame buffalos and other cattle grazing on its level meadows; a few half-naked darkies are fishing in a little water which remains in one corner; on either hand the lakebottom is bounded by woods, and out of these woods, and out of the woods behind one, high above the trees loom green and overgrown masses of masonry, while below and among them labyrinths of unexplored ruins are hidden in thick dark tangle. It is as if London had again become a wilderness, above which the Albert Memorial and S. Paul’s and the Tower still reared confused heaps of grassy stone and brickwork, while sheep and oxen browsed peacefully in the bed of the Thames, now diverted into another channel. Here for instance still standing in a great square, on a piece of ground over an acre in extent, are sixteen hundred rough-hewn columns, solid granite, projecting about ten feet out of the ground, and arranged in parallel rows at right angles to each other. They are supposed to form the foundation storey of a building nine storeys high, no doubt built of wood, but according to the ancient chronicles of the Mahawanso gorgeously decorated, with its resplendent brass-covered roof and central hall of golden pillars and ivory throne, erected in the second century B.C., occupied by the royal folk and the priests, and called the Brazen Palace. Close by is the glory of Buddhism and of Ceylon, the oldest historical tree in the world, the celebrated101 bo-tree of Anurádhapura, planted 245 years before the Christian era (from a slip, it is said, of the tree under which Buddha sat when the great illumination came to him), and now more than twenty-one centuries old. Extraordinary as the age is, yet the chronicles of this tree’s life have been so carefully kept (see Emerson Tennent’s Ceylon, where twenty-five references from the Mahawanso and other chronicles are given, covering from B.C. 288 to A.D. 1739), that there is at least fair reason for supposing that the story is correct. The bo-tree, though belonging to the fig family, has a leaf strongly resembling that of an aspen. The mid-rib of the leaf is however prolonged some two inches into a narrow point, which is sometimes curved into quite a hook. The tremulous motion of the leaf and the general appearance of the tree also resemble the aspen, though the growth is somewhat sturdier. Thousands of bo-trees are planted all over India and Ceylon in memory of Buddha (though the tree was probably an object of veneration before his time); the ground is sacred where they stand, and a good Buddhist will on no account cut one down, however inconveniently it may be growing. This particular tree, it must be confessed, is somewhat disappointing. It is small, and though obviously old, does not suggest the idea of extreme antiquity. It springs from the top of a mound some fifteen feet high, and the probability I think is that this mound has in the course of centuries been thrown up round the original trunk to support and protect it—just as has happened to Milton’s mulberry tree at Cambridge, and to others—and thus has gradually hidden a great102 part of the tree from view. And this idea seems, to be supported by the fact that six or seven other and lesser stems branch out from neighboring parts of the same mound, the terraces and shrines which occupy the mound helping to conceal the fact that these also are, or were at one time, really all parts of one tree. Anyhow the whole enclosure, which is about an acre in extent and is surrounded by an ancient wall, is thickly planted with bo-trees, some of really fine dimensions, so that the pious pilgrim need have no difficulty in securing a leaf, without committing the sacrilege of robbing the venerable plant.",
        "target_summary": "The ancient city's remains are located in the great plain at Ceylon's northern end. Reaching them from Dambulla, even the nearest outpost of civilization, necessitates an uncomfortable overnight journey by bullock-drawn \"mail-coach.\" This clumsy cart, often full of native passengers, covers forty-two miles of darkness, requiring six changes of humped cattle, and makes sleep nearly impossible. Travelers finally arrive around 6 a.m., driving through woods already revealing ruins.\n\nOn the site of this once vast and populous town now stands a small village.

The local cutcherry sits by a large reservoir that once supplied the city but is now nearly dry due to lack of rain and channel deficiencies. Climbing its embankment, one sees the lake bed stretching out, with hundreds of tame buffalo and other cattle grazing on its meadows, and a few half-naked individuals fishing in a small remaining pool. Woods border the lakebed, and from these, towering green, overgrown masses of masonry loom above the trees, while labyrinths of unexplored ruins lie hidden in thick tangle below.

Its extraordinary age is supported by meticulously kept chronicles, with numerous references detailing its life from B.C. 288 to A.D. 1739, lending strong credibility to its history.\n\nThe bo-tree, a member of the fig family, has leaves strikingly similar to an aspen, with a mid-rib prolonged into a two-inch, often hooked point, and a characteristic tremulous motion, though the tree itself is sturdier. Thousands of bo-trees are sacredly planted across India and Ceylon in Buddha's memory, and no devout Buddhist would ever cut one down. However, this particular ancient bo-tree is somewhat disappointing in appearance; it is small and, despite its obvious age, doesn't immediately convey extreme antiquity. It grows from a fifteen-foot-high mound, which the author speculates was built up over centuries to support and protect the original trunk, thus concealing a large portion of the tree. This idea is supported by six or seven other smaller stems branching from different parts of the same mound, with surrounding terraces and shrines further obscuring that these were once all part of the original tree. The entire acre-sized enclosure, surrounded by an ancient wall, is also densely planted with many other bo-trees of impressive dimensions, ensuring pilgrims can easily obtain a leaf without desecrating the venerable plant.",

        "content": "Here, to this sacred enclosure, and to deposit flowers and offerings within it, come at certain festivals thousands of Buddhist pilgrims. Trudging in on foot or driving by bullock-cart they camp out in the park-like grounds in the immediate neighborhood of the present village, and after paying their respects to the holy tree go to visit the dágobas and other monuments which enshrine a bone or a tooth or a hair from the brow of their great teacher. For the rest of the year these places are left almost unvisited. There are no guides to importune the rare tourist or traveler, and one wanders alone through the woods for a whole day and sees no one, except it be a troop of monkeys, with tails erect, playing leap-frog over the stumps of fallen columns, as if in ridicule of the old priests, or sitting like fakirs on the tops of those still standing. The dágobas, which are by far the most important remains here, are bell-shaped structures mostly of solid brick, originally built to enshrine some relic.103 They might ingeniously be mistaken for ornamental candle-extinguishers made on a vast scale, and have mostly in their time been coated with a white plaster and decorated here and there with gold or brass. Round them have been courts supported on stone columns; and generally at the four points—North, East, West, and South—have been placed little shrines with well-cut steps and ornamental balustrades leading up to them. The interiors of these dágobas—such as they may have been—have never been accessible except to the priests; sometimes, no doubt, treasures have been concealed within them, but for the most part probably they have concealed nothing except the supposed relic, and have been built to gratify the pride and add to the popularity of the monarch of the day. The Thuparama Dágoba, which stands at the northern extremity of the park-like clearings above mentioned, is supposed by Fergusson (Handbook to Architecture, vol. i., p. 41) to be older than any monument now existing on the continent of India. It was built by King Dewanipiatissa in B.C. 307 to enshrine the right collar-bone of Buddha, and was restored some years ago by the pious, so that one gets a good idea from it of the general appearance these objects originally presented. It is white, bell-shaped, and some sixty-five feet high, with a brass pinnacle on the top; and some elegant columns about eighteen feet high stand yet in admired disorder in the court below. In the accompanying illustration the dágoba and surrounding columns appear some distance in the background, and the stone pillars and steps in the foreground are the104 remains of the Dalada Maligawa—a temple which was built to receive the sacred tooth of Buddha when it was first brought over to Ceylon from the mainland. Round this tooth battles raged, and in the struggle for its possession dynasties rose and fell. The enormous saurian fang, which purports to be the same tooth, is now preserved in great state in the well-known Buddhist temple at Kandy, as I have already mentioned. The little figure of a gate-keeper or dhworpal at the foot of the steps is an excellent specimen of early Buddhist sculpture, and is very graceful and tender. It is given on a larger scale in a separate illustration",

They camp nearby, pay respects to a holy tree, and then visit dágobas and other monuments enshrining relics like Buddha's bones, teeth, or hair. For the remainder of the year, the site is largely deserted, with no guides and only monkeys playing among the ruins.\n\nThe dágobas, the most important remains, are bell-shaped, solid brick structures initially built to house relics. They resemble vast ornamental candle-extinguishers, were typically coated with white plaster, and decorated with gold or brass. Courts supported by stone columns surrounded them, often featuring small shrines with steps and balustrades at the four cardinal points.

        "content": "The Ruanweli (or Gold-dust) Dágoba, which105 rears its unshapely form close to the present village, gives one a notion of the massiveness of these ancient structures, and at the same time of the ravages which lapse of years has wrought upon them. In outline it resembles a gigantic but ill-made circular haystack, 150 feet high. All the upper part of it is covered with thick grass, except where recent lapses have exposed the close yet rather soft brickwork of which the whole is compacted. The more accessible lower parts and surrounding terraces have lately been cleaned of undergrowth; and at the foot, among some well-executed carvings, stand four or five fine statues, about eight feet high—one of King Dutugemunu who is said to have begun the building about B.C. 161, the others apparently of Buddha, and all dignified and noble in conception, if not anatomically perfect in execution. But the dágobas which best show the gradual effacement of human handiwork by Nature are the Jetawanarama and the Abhayagiria, both of which stand some distance out in the woods, and tower above the foliage to the heights of 250 feet and 300 feet respectively. The former of these (see plate at beginning of this chapter) presents a vast cone of brickwork some 200 feet high, surmounted by a cylindrical column of the same; and the conical portion is simply overgrown by dense masses of trees, which inserting their roots into the crevices of the bricks are continually dislodging portions of this artificial mountain. Cactuses, varieties of fig, and other trees climb to the very base of the column, and here, where the brickwork is too steep to be covered with foliage, the omnipresent wanderoo106 monkey may be seen disporting itself on the very summit. The Abhayagiria is of similar shape, but only covered at present with a shrub-like growth. Originally it was the largest dágoba in Ceylon, being 405 feet high—or as high as S. Paul’s—but time has reduced it to somewhere about 300 feet. A rather precipitous path leads from the base to the summit, which has recently been restored in some fashion, and from thence a fine view may be obtained. As you roam through the woods by jungle paths, or along the two or three roads which have been made in late years to open up the ruins, you come upon innumerable smaller remains. Most frequent among these are groups of columns still standing, twenty or thirty together, sometimes only rough-hewn, sometimes elegantly shaped, with carven capitals, which either formed the foundation storeys of wooden buildings, or being themselves covered with roofs constituted porticos for the resting-places of the gods in their processions, or habitations for the use of the priests. There are very few remains of walled buildings, stone or brick, but plentiful foundation outlines of what may have been public or sacred enclosures of one kind or another—some with handsome flights of steps and balustrades leading up to them, and for the lowest step the frequent half-moon stone carved with elegant devices of the elephant, the lion, the horse, the brahman bull, the goose, and the lotus-flower. Here among the tangle is a flight of half-a-dozen steps, springing from nowhere and apparently leading nowhither.107 There is a gigantic stone trough, sixty-two feet long by four feet four inches wide, over which the learned are in doubt whether it was used to contain food for the royal elephants or boiled rice for the priests! Here at any rate is a cistern ten feet long by five wide, elegantly carved out of a single block of granite, which, tradition says, served for the priests’ rice-dish; and which only a few years ago was, by the subscription of a neighboring country side, filled full of food (see S. M. Burrows’ Buried Cities of Ceylon; London, Trübner & Co., 1885) for the pilgrims of the June full moon. There again is one of the numerous flat slabs which may be found, bearing an ancient inscription on its face; and in almost every direction are solid stone swimming baths or tanks, ten, twenty, or thirty yards up to (in one case) fully 100 yards in length. Two of these pókunas, so-called—the twin pókunas—stand near the northern circular road, and are still in good preservation; the one given in the illustration on next page is forty-four yards long, the other about thirty, and both have handsome flights of steps at each end by which to descend to the water, and step-like tiers of stonework round the sides. They were of course not covered, but open to the sun and air.",
        "target_summary": "The Ruanweli Dágoba, a massive ancient structure resembling a 150-foot-high circular haystack, powerfully illustrates the ravages of time. Its upper sections are grass-covered, revealing soft brickwork in recent exposures, while its lower parts, now cleaned, display fine carvings and 8-foot statues. These include King Dutugemunu, who initiated the building around 161 B.C., and dignified Buddha figures.\n\nFurther into the woods, the Jetawanarama and Abhayagiria dágobas demonstrate Nature's reclaiming power. The Jetawanarama, towering 250 feet, consists of a 200-foot brick cone topped by a cylindrical column. Dense trees, with roots dislodging bricks, heavily overgrow the conical base, and monkeys are seen on its summit. The Abhayagiria, similar in shape and currently 300 feet high, was once Ceylon's largest dágoba at 405 feet. It is now covered in shrub-like growth, with a steep path leading to its recently restored summit, offering expansive views.\n\nExploring the area reveals countless smaller ruins, primarily groups of 20-30 standing columns. These columns, ranging from rough-hewn to elegantly carved with capitals, likely served as foundations for wooden buildings, porticos for deities, or priests' habitations. Few walled structures remain, but numerous foundation outlines suggest public or sacred enclosures. These often feature handsome flights of steps with balustrades, and a characteristic half-moon stone at the lowest step, intricately carved with elephants, lions, horses, brahman bulls, geese, and lotus flowers.\n\nOther discoveries include a perplexing flight of steps leading nowhere, a gigantic 62-foot-long stone trough (its purpose, royal elephant food or priests' rice, remains debated), and a 10-foot-long granite cistern, traditionally used for priests' rice and recently filled for pilgrims. Inscribed slabs and numerous solid stone swimming baths, or pókunas, ranging from 10 to 100 yards in length, are also common. Two notable examples, the \"twin pókunas,\" are well-preserved near the northern road, measuring 44 and 30 yards long respectively, each featuring handsome steps at both ends and tiered stonework around their open sides.",

        "content": "As you go along the road after leaving these tanks, at a turn you suddenly come upon a seated image of Buddha—by the wayside, under the trees. The figure is about seven feet high as it sits. It is of dark-colored granite, and though slightly defaced is still by far the best thing of its kind in the place. Most of the images of Buddha in the present temples108 of Ceylon are painfully crude productions; but this has caught something of the grace of the great Guru. The eyelids are just shut, yet so slightly as to suggest that the figure is not lost in the ordinary material sleep, but only in that luminous slumber which, while closing itself to the outward and transitory world, opens on the eternal and steadfast consciousness behind. A deep calm overspreads the face—so deep that it insensibly affects the passerby. He involuntarily stops and gazes, surrendering himself to its influence, and to that of the silent forest. His thoughts subside, like waves on water when the wind ceases. He too for a moment touches the well-spring of being—he swims into109 identity with the universe; the trees flicker in the evening light, the Buddha just gives the slightest nod, as much as to say, “That’s it”; and then—he is but stone again, and the road stretches beyond. Curious that one man should so affect the world that he should leave his bo-trees and his dágobas and his images in thousands over half a continent; that he should gather vast cities round his name, and still, when they have perished and passed away, should remain the most glorious thing connected with them; yet Buddha could not have had this ascendancy had not other people in their thousands and hundreds of thousands experienced in greater or less degree the same facts that he experienced. We must forgive, after all, the dirty yellow-robed priests, with their greedy claws and stinking shrines. It was Buddha’s fault, not theirs, when he explored poor human nature so deeply as to invest even its lowest manifestations with sanctity. Where this image now sits perhaps once it looked down upon the busy turmoil of a great street. The glories of the capital of the Cinghalese kingdom unrolled before and beneath it. Hear how the chronicler of the seventh century (quoted by Emerson Tennent) describes—with justifiable pride—the splendor of the city in his day: “The temples and palaces whose golden pinnacles glitter in the sky, the streets spanned by arches bearing flags, the ways strewn with sand, and on either side vessels containing flowers, and niches with statues holding lamps. Here are multitudes of men armed with swords and bows and arrows. Elephants, horses, carts, and myriads of people pass and repass—jugglers, 110 dancers, and musicians of all nations, with chank shells and other instruments ornamented with gold. The distance from the principal gate to the east gate is four gows, and the same from the north to the south gate. The principal streets are Moon Street, Great King Street, Hinguruwak, and Mahawelli Street—the first containing 11, 000 houses, many of them two storeys in height. The smaller streets are innumerable. The palace has large ranges of buildings, some of them two and three storeys high, and its subterranean apartments are of great extent.” Fa Hian, the Chinese traveler, who visited Ceylon about 413 A.D., also says: “The city is the residence of many magistrates, grandees, and foreign merchants; the mansions beautiful, the public buildings richly adorned, the streets and highways straight and level, and houses for preaching built at every thoroughfare.” Nor was the civilisation of Anurádhapura merely material in its scope, for Tennent tells us that beside public gardens and baths, halls for music and dancing, rest-houses for travelers, almshouses, etc., they had hospitals in which animals as well as men were tenderly cared for. “The corn of a thousand fields was set apart by one king for their use; another put aside rice to feed the squirrels which frequented his gardens; and a third displayed his surgical skill in treating the diseases of elephants, horses, and snakes.”",
        "target_summary": "By a roadside in Ceylon, after passing some tanks, stands a seven-foot-tall Buddha statue carved from dark granite. Despite slight defacement, it is considered the finest of its kind in the region, surpassing the often crude images found in temples. Its eyelids are subtly shut, conveying not ordinary sleep but a luminous slumber that closes off the external world to open upon an eternal consciousness. A profound calm emanates from its face, compelling passersby to stop, gaze, and yield to its influence and that of the silent forest. Their thoughts quiet, and for a moment, they touch a deeper sense of being, identifying with the universe, before the statue reverts to mere stone.\n\nThe author marvels at Buddha's enduring global impact—his teachings, symbols like bo-trees and dagobas, and countless images spread across half a continent, inspiring and outliving vast cities. This lasting influence, it's suggested, stems from countless others having experienced similar truths to his. The text extends forgiveness to the \"dirty yellow-robed priests,\" attributing any perceived failings to Buddha's own profound exploration of human nature, which endowed even its lowest forms with sanctity.\n\nThis very statue might have once overlooked the bustling heart of Anuradhapura, the magnificent capital of the Cinghalese kingdom. A 7th-century chronicler, quoted by Emerson Tennent, proudly depicted its splendor: palaces and temples with golden pinnacles, streets adorned with flag-bearing arches, strewn with sand, and lined with flowers and lamp-holding statues. The city was alive with armed men, elephants, horses, carts, and diverse throngs of jugglers, dancers, and musicians. It was expansive, measuring four gows across, featuring prominent streets like Moon Street, which alone boasted 11,000 houses, many two stories high, alongside innumerable smaller thoroughfares. The palace itself comprised extensive multi-story buildings and vast subterranean chambers.\n\nFa Hian, a Chinese traveler visiting around 413 A.D., also described Anuradhapura as a city of magistrates, grandees, and foreign merchants, characterized by beautiful mansions, richly adorned public buildings, straight and level streets, and preaching houses at every crossroads. Tennent further notes that Anuradhapura's civilization extended beyond material wealth, offering public gardens, baths, music and dancing halls, rest-houses, almshouses, and even hospitals that provided tender care for both humans and animals. Kings famously dedicated resources like corn for animals, rice for squirrels in their gardens, and one even demonstrated surgical expertise in treating ailments of elephants, horses, and snakes.",

        "content": "Founded by Cinghalese invaders of the island somewhere in the fifth or sixth centuries B.C., the city attained its first splendor under King Dewanipiatissa, who came to the throne in B.C. 306. “It was111 in his reign,” says Burrows, “that the royal missionary Mahindo, son of the Indian king Dharmasoka, landed in Ceylon, and either introduced or regenerated Buddhism. The monarch and all his court, his consort and her women, became ready converts to the new tenets; the arrival of Mahindo’s sister, Sanghamitta, with a branch of the identical tree under which Gautama obtained Buddha-hood, consummated the conversion of the island; and the king devoted the rest of his reign to the erection of enormous monuments, rock-temples, and monasteries, to mark his zeal for the new faith.” After him troubles began. The Tamils of Southern India—whose history has been for so long entangled with that of the Cinghalese—or some branch of the race, attracted probably by the wealth of the new city, landed in Ceylon about 200 B.C. And from that time forward the history of Anurádhapura is the record of continual conflict between the races. There was a second great invasion in B.C. 104, and a third about A.D. 106, in which the Tamils are said to have carried back to the mainland 12, 000 Cinghalese captives, as well as great quantities of treasure. But the peaceful quiet-loving Cinghalese, whose chief talents lay in the direction of agricultural pursuits and the construction of those enormous tanks and irrigation works which still form one of the most remarkable features of the country, were no match in the arts of wars for the enterprising genius of the Tamils. The latter gradually pushed their way in more and more, dissensions between the two peoples more and more disorganised the city, till at last, for some reason not very clearly explained, in A.D. 769112 the then king (Aggrabodhi IV.) evacuated his capital and established himself at Pollanarua, now also a buried city of the jungle. From that time, it may be supposed, Anurádhapura rapidly dwindled away; the streets were no more filled with gay crowds, the slight habitations of the populace soon fell to pieces, leaving no trace behind (except a soil impregnated for miles and miles with the débris of bricks); the stone palaces and temples lapsed into decay. And now Buddha sits in the silence of the forest, folded in the ancient calm, just as he sat centuries and centuries ago in the tumult and roar of the city; night falls, and the elephant and the bear roam past him through the brushwood, the herds of spotted deer are startled for a moment by his lonely form in the moonlight. If one ascends the Abhayagiria dágoba, from its vantage height of 300 feet he has a good bird’s-eye view of the region. Before him to the west and north stretches as far as the eye can see a level plain almost unbroken by hills. This plain is covered, except for a few reservoirs and an occasional but rare oasis of coco-nut palm, by dense woods. On all sides they stretch, like a uniform grey-green carpet over the earth; even the present village of Anurádhapura hardly makes a break,—so small is it, and interspersed with trees. Through these woods run narrow jungle paths, and among them, scattered at intervals for miles and miles, are ruins similar to those I have described. And this is all that is left to-day of the ancient city.",
        "target_summary": "Anurádhapura, founded by Cinghalese invaders in the fifth or sixth centuries B.C., reached its first peak under King Dewanipiatissa, who began his reign in 306 B.C. It was during his rule that the royal missionary Mahindo, son of the Indian king Dharmasoka, arrived in Ceylon, introducing or regenerating Buddhism. The king, his entire court, and his consort embraced the new faith. The island's conversion was cemented by the arrival of Mahindo's sister, Sanghamitta, bringing a branch of the very tree under which Gautama attained Buddha-hood. Dewanipiatissa then dedicated the rest of his reign to constructing enormous monuments, rock-temples, and monasteries to signify his devotion.\n\nFollowing his death, conflicts began. Around 200 B.C., Tamils from Southern India, likely attracted by the city's wealth, invaded Ceylon, initiating a long history of strife between the two peoples. Further significant invasions occurred in 104 B.C. and about A.D. 106, the latter reportedly leading to the capture of 12,000 Cinghalese and vast quantities of treasure. The peaceful, agriculturally-focused Cinghalese, renowned for their extensive irrigation works, were militarily inferior to the Tamils' enterprising nature. This persistent pressure and internal disorganization led to the city's decline.\n\nUltimately, in A.D. 769, King Aggrabodhi IV evacuated Anurádhapura, relocating the capital to Pollanarua. From this point, Anurádhapura rapidly dwindled; its lively streets emptied, the ephemeral dwellings of its populace disintegrated, leaving only a soil rich with brick debris, and its stone palaces and temples fell into decay. Today, ancient Buddha statues sit silently amidst the forest, contrasting sharply with the city's past \"tumult and roar,\" as wildlife like elephants, bears, and deer roam past them. From the 300-foot height of the Abhayagiriya dágoba, one can view a vast, flat plain stretching west and north, covered almost entirely by dense woods, broken only by occasional reservoirs or rare coconut oases. Within these woods, narrow jungle paths lead to scattered ruins for miles around, which are all that remains of the once-grand ancient city.",

For myself113 I can only say that I have walked through these and other such scenes with a sense of unfeigned gratitude that they belong to a past which is dead and done with. That Time sweeps all these efforts of mortality (and our own as well) in due course into his dustbin is a matter for which we can never be sufficiently thankful. Think, if all the monuments of human pride and folly which have been created were to endure indefinitely,—if even our own best and most useful works were to remain, cumbering114 up the earth with their very multitude, what a nuisance it would be! The great kings caused glorious palaces and statues and temples to be made, thinking to outvie all former and paralyse all future efforts of mankind, perpetuating their names to the end of the years. But Time, wiser, quickly removed all these things as soon as their authors were decently out of the way, leaving us just as much of them as is sufficient to convey the ideas which underlay them, and no more. As a vast dágoba, containing bricks enough to build a good-sized town of, is erected to enshrine a single hair from the head of a great man, so the glorious temples and statues and pictures and palaces of a whole epoch, all put together, do but enshrine a tiny atom of the eternal beauty. Let them deliver that, and go their way. What a good thing even that our bodies die! How thankful we ought to be that they are duly interred and done with in course of time. Fancy if we were condemned always to go on in the same identical forms, each of us, repeating the same ancient jokes, making the same wise remarks, priding ourselves on the same superiorities over our fellows, enduring the same insults from them, wearing the same fusty garments, ever getting raggeder and raggeder through the centuries—what a fate! No; let us know there is something better than that. These swarms of idle priests who ate rice out of troughs at the public expense; these endless mumbo-jumbo books that they wrote; these mighty kings with their royal finery, their harlots, and their insane battles; these animal hospitals; these ruins of great cities lost in thickets; these Alexandrian libraries burnt to ashes; these115 Greek statues broken and buried in the earth—all that is really durable in them has endured and will endure, the rest is surely well out of the way. Certainly, as one jogs through the mortal hours of the night in that said mail-cart, returning the forty-two miles from Anurádhapura to Dambulla (where one meets with the nearest horse coach), wedged in with five or six other passengers, and trying in vain to find a place for one’s feet amid the compacted mass of baggage that occupies the bottom of the cart, or to avoid the side-rails and rods that impinge upon one’s back and head—kept well awake by the continual jingling of bells and the yells and thwacks of the driver, as he urges his active little brahminy bulls through the darkness, or stopping to change team at wayside cabins where long conversations ensue, between dusky figures bearing lamps, on the state of the road and the probabilities of an encounter with the rogue-elephant who is supposed to haunt it—all those twelve long hours one has ample time to make suitable reflections of some kind or other on the transitory and ineffectual nature of our little human endeavor.",

He argues that if all monuments of human pride, folly, or even utility were to endure indefinitely, they would create an intolerable burden on earth. Kings, despite building glorious structures to eternalize their names, were ultimately surpassed by Time, which wisely removed most of these, preserving only enough to convey their underlying ideas. The author employs the metaphor of a vast dágoba built for a single hair, suggesting that an entire epoch's grand creations merely enshrine a tiny fraction of eternal beauty before they, too, should pass.\n\nThis thankfulness extends to the mortality of human bodies, as the author deems an endless, unchanging existence—repeating old habits and wearing out—a dreadful fate. He reflects on numerous ephemeral human endeavors, including idle priests, \"mumbo-jumbo\" books, mighty kings with their conflicts, ruined cities, and destroyed libraries. He concludes that only what is truly durable in them endures, while the rest is better gone.

        "title": "A NIGHT-FESTIVAL IN A HINDU TEMPLE.",
        "content": "The festival of Taypusam is one of the more important among the many religious festivals of the Hindus, and is celebrated with great rejoicings on the night of the first full moon in January each year. In the case of the great temples of Southern India, some of which are so vast that their enclosures are more than a mile in circumference, enormous crowds—sometimes 20,000 people or more—will congregate together to witness the ceremonials, which are elaborately gorgeous. There are a few Hindu temples of smaller size in Ceylon, and into one of these I had the good fortune to be admitted, on the occasion of this year’s festival (1891), and at the time when the proceedings were about to commence. It was nine o’clock, the full moon was shining in the sky, and already the blaring of trumpets and horns could be heard from within as I stood at the gate seeking admittance. At first this was positively denied; but my companion, who was a person, of some authority in the temple, soon effected an entrance, and we presently stood within the precincts. It must be understood that these temples generally consist of a large oblong enclosure, more or less planted with palms and other trees, within117 which stands the sanctuary itself, with lesser shrines, priests’ dwellings and other buildings grouped round it. In the present case the enclosure was about one hundred yards long by sixty or seventy wide, with short grass under foot. In the centre stood the temple proper—a building without any pretensions to architectural form, a mere oblong, bounded by a wall ten or twelve feet high; unbroken by any windows, and rudely painted in vertical stripes, red and white. At the far end, under trees, were some low priests’ cottages; and farther on a tank or reservoir, not very large, with a stone balustrade around it. Coming round to the front of the temple, which was more ornamented, and where the main doorway or entrance was, we found there a considerable crowd assembled. We were in fact just in time to witness the beginning of the ceremony; for almost immediately a lot of folk came rushing out through the doorway of the temple in evident excitement; torches were lighted, consisting of long poles, some surmounted with a flaming ring of rags dipped in coco-nut oil, others with a small iron crate in which lumps of broken coco-nut burned merrily. In a few moments there was a brilliant light; the people arranged themselves in two lines from the temple door; sounds of music from within got louder; and a small procession appeared, musicians first, then four nautch girls, and lastly a small platform supported on the shoulders of men, on which was the great god Siva. At first I could not make out what this last-named object was, but presently distinguished two118 rude representations of male and female figures, Siva and his consort Sakti, apparently cut out of one block, seated, and about three feet high, but so bedone with jewels and silks that it was difficult to be sure of their anatomy! Over them was held a big ornamental umbrella, and behind followed the priest. We joined the procession, and soon arrived at the edge of the reservoir which I have already mentioned, and on which was floating a strange kind of ship. It was a raft made of bamboos lashed to empty barrels, and on it a most florid and brilliant canopy, covered with cloths of different colors and surmounted by little scarlet pennants. A flight of steps down to the water occupied the whole of one side of the tank, the other three sides were surrounded by the stone balcony, and on these steps and round the balcony the crowd immediately disposed itself, while the procession went on board. When the god was properly arranged under his canopy, and the nautch girls round about him, and when room had been found for the crew, who with long poles were to propel the vessel, and for as many musicians as convenient—about a dozen souls in all—a bell rang, and the priest, a brown-bodied young Brahman with the sacred thread over his shoulders and a white cloth edged with red round his loins, made an offering of flame of camphor in a five-branched lamp. A hush fell upon the crowd, who all held their hands, palms together, as in the attitude of prayer (but also symbol of the desire to be joined together and to the god)—some with their arms high above their heads; a tray was placed on the raft, of coco-nuts and bananas which the priest119 opening deposited before the image; the band burst forth into renewed uproar, and the ship went gyrating over the water on her queer voyage.",
        "target_summary": "The Hindu festival of Taypusam, a major annual celebration held on the first full moon in January, typically features elaborate and joyous ceremonials. While vast Southern Indian temples may draw crowds of 20,000 or more to enclosures over a mile in circumference, the narrator was fortunate to attend the 1891 festival at a smaller Hindu temple in Ceylon just as proceedings were to begin.\n\nAt nine o'clock, with the full moon shining and trumpets blaring from within, the narrator sought admittance. Initially denied, his companion, a temple authority, secured their entry into the precincts. This particular temple's large oblong enclosure, about one hundred by sixty or seventy yards, was sparsely planted with trees and had short grass. Centered within stood the sanctuary itself—a simple, windowless oblong building with ten to twelve-foot-high walls, rudely painted in red and white vertical stripes. Lesser shrines, low priests' cottages under trees, and a small reservoir with a stone balustrade completed the layout.\n\nAt the temple's more ornamented front, where the main doorway was, a considerable crowd had gathered. They were just in time for the ceremony's start: excited folk rushed from the temple as numerous torches were lit, some featuring flaming rags in coconut oil, others burning coconut in iron crates, creating brilliant light. The crowd formed two lines from the door as music intensified, and a procession emerged. It began with musicians, followed by four nautch girls, then a small platform carried by men bearing the deity Siva. The narrator identified this as crude, three-foot-high seated figures of Siva and his consort Sakti, carved from one block and so heavily adorned with jewels and silks that their form was obscured. An ornamental umbrella shielded them, with a priest following behind.\n\nJoining the procession, they reached the reservoir, where a brightly colored, canopied raft, constructed from bamboos lashed to barrels and adorned with colorful cloths and scarlet pennants, floated. The crowd quickly filled the steps descending to the water and the stone balcony surrounding the other three sides of the tank. The procession then boarded the raft, arranging the god under the canopy, with nautch girls, crew (equipped with long poles for propulsion), and musicians—about a dozen people in all—finding space. A bell rang, and a young Brahman priest, wearing a sacred thread and a white cloth, made an offering of camphor flame in a five-branched lamp. A hush fell as the crowd, some with arms raised, held their hands palms together in an attitude of prayer, symbolizing a desire for unity with each other and the god. The priest then deposited an offering tray of coconuts and bananas before the image. The band's music swelled, and the raft began its gyrating journey across the water.",

        "content": "What a scene! I had now time to look around a little. All round the little lake, thronging the steps and the sides in the great glare of the torches, were hundreds of men and boys, barebodied, barehead and barefoot, but with white loin-cloths—all in a state of great excitement—not religious so much as spectacular, as at the commencement of a theatrical performance, myself and companion about the only persons clothed,—except that in a corner and forming a pretty mass of color were a few women and girls, of the poorer class of Tamils, but brightly dressed, with nose-rings and ear-rings profusely ornamented. On the water, brilliant in scarlet and gold and blue, was floating the sacred canopy, surrounded by120 musicians yelling on their various horns, in the front of which—with the priest standing between them—sat two little naked boys holding small torches; while overhead through the leaves of plentiful coco-nut and banana palms overhanging the tank, in the dim blue sky among gorgeous cloud-outlines just discernible, shone the goddess of night, the cause of all this commotion. Such a blowing up of trumpets in the full moon! For the first time I gathered some clear idea of what the ancient festivals were like. Here was a boy blowing two pipes at the same time, exactly as in the Greek bas-reliefs. There was a man droning a deep bourdon on a reed instrument, with cheeks puffed into pouches with long-sustained effort of blowing; to him was attached a shrill flageolet player—the two together giving much the effect of Highland bagpipes. Then there were the tomtoms, whose stretched skins produce quite musical and bell-like though monotonous sounds; and lastly two old men jingling cymbals and at the same time blowing their terrible chank-horns or conches. These chanks are much used in Buddhist and Hindu temples. They are large whorled sea-shells of the whelk shape, such as sometimes ornament our mantels. The apex of the spiral is cut away and a mouthpiece cemented in its place, through which the instrument can be blown like a horn. If then the fingers be used to partly cover and vary the mouth of the shell, and at the same time the shell be vibrated to and fro in the air—what with its natural convolutions and these added complications, the most ear-rending and diabolically wavy bewildering121 and hollow sounds can be produced, such as might surely infect the most callous worshiper with a proper faith in the supernatural. The temper of the crowd too helped one to understand the old religious attitude. It was thoroughly whole-hearted—I cannot think of any other word. There was no piety—in our sense of the word—or very little, observable. They were just thoroughly enjoying themselves—a little excited no doubt by chanks and divine possibilities generally, but not subdued by awe; talking freely to each other in low tones, or even indulging occasionally—the younger ones—in a little bear-fighting; at the same time proud of the spectacle and the presence of the divinity, heart and soul in the ceremony, and anxious to lend hands as torch-bearers or image-bearers, or in any way, to its successful issue. It is this temper which the wise men say is encouraged and purposely cultivated by the ceremonial institutions of Hinduism. The temple services are made to cover, as far as may be, the whole ground of life, and to provide the pleasures of the theatre, the art-gallery, the music hall and the concert-room in one. People attracted by these spectacles—which are very numerous and very varied in character, according to the different feasts—presently remain to inquire into their meaning. Some like the music, others the bright colors. Many men come at first merely to witness the dancing of the nautch girls, but afterwards and insensibly are drawn into spheres of more spiritual influence. Even the children find plenty to attract them, and the temple becomes their familiar resort from early life. 122 The theory is that all the ceremonies have inner and mystic meanings—which meanings in due time are declared to those who are fit—and that thus the temple institutions and ceremonies constitute a great ladder by which men can rise at last to those inner truths which lie beyond all formulas and are contained in no creed. Such is the theory, but like all theories it requires large deductions before acceptance. That such theory was one of the formative influences of the Hindu ceremonial, and that the latter embodies here and there important esoteric truths descending from Vedic times, I hardly doubt; but on the other hand, time, custom and neglect, different streams of tradition blending and blurring each other, reforms and a thousand influences have—as in all such cases—produced a total concrete result which no one theory can account for or coordinate.",
        "target_summary": "The author describes a captivating scene around a small lake, where hundreds of bare-bodied, bareheaded, and barefoot men and boys, adorned with white loin-cloths, thronged the steps and sides under brilliant torchlight. Their excitement, more spectacular than religious, resembled a theatrical opening. The author and his companion were among the few clothed, while brightly dressed Tamil women and girls, profusely ornamented with nose-rings and ear-rings, formed a colorful group. On the water, a sacred canopy in scarlet, gold, and blue floated, surrounded by 120 musicians and young torch-bearers. Overhead, the full moon, perceived as the goddess of night, shone through the abundant palm leaves, evoking a sense of ancient festival.\n\nThe air vibrated with diverse music: a boy blowing two pipes simultaneously (like Greek bas-reliefs), a man droning a deep bourdon on a reed instrument with puffed cheeks, accompanied by a shrill flageolet (together sounding like Highland bagpipes). Tomtoms provided musical, bell-like yet monotonous sounds, while two old men jingled cymbals and blew \"terrible\" chank-horns. These large conch shells, common in Buddhist and Hindu temples, had their apex cut away for a mouthpiece. By manipulating the shell's mouth with fingers and vibrating it, they produced \"ear-rending,\" diabolically wavy, bewildering, and hollow sounds, intended to inspire supernatural faith.\n\nThe crowd's atmosphere further illuminated the ancient religious attitude, being \"thoroughly whole-hearted\" with little Western-sense \"piety.\" They were simply enjoying themselves, excited but not subdued by awe, conversing freely, and younger ones occasionally engaging in playful scuffles. Simultaneously, they were proud of the spectacle, conscious of the divinity's presence, fully invested in the ceremony, and eager to participate as torch or image-bearers. This specific temper, the author notes, is deliberately fostered by Hinduism's ceremonial institutions.\n\nHindu temple services are designed to cover the entire spectrum of life, offering the combined pleasures of a theatre, art-gallery, music hall, and concert-room. People, initially attracted by the numerous and varied spectacles—whether by music, bright colors, or even the dancing of nautch girls—gradually inquire into their deeper spiritual meaning, making the temple a familiar resort from early life.\n\nThe theoretical underpinning is that all ceremonies possess inner, mystic meanings, revealed to the deserving, thereby constituting a \"great ladder\" for individuals to ascend to inner truths beyond formulas and creeds. The author acknowledges this theory's formative influence and the ceremonies' embodiment of important esoteric truths from Vedic times. However, he cautions that like all theories, it requires \"large deductions,\" as centuries of time, custom, neglect, blending traditions, reforms, and myriad other influences have produced a complex reality that no single theory can fully account for or coordinate.",

        "content": "Such were some of my thoughts as I watched the crowd around me. They too were not uninterested in watching me. The appearance of an Englishman under such circumstances was perhaps a little unusual and scores of black eyes were turned inquiringly in my direction; but covered as I was by the authority of my companion no one seemed to resent my presence. A few I thought looked shocked, but the most seemed rather pleased, as if proud that a spectacle so brilliant and impressive should be witnessed by a stranger—besides there were two or three among the crowd whom I happened to have met before and spoken with, and whose friendly glances made me feel at home. Meanwhile the gyrating raft had completed two123 or three voyages round the little piece of water. Each time it returned to the shore fresh offerings were made to the god, the bell was rung again, a moment of hushed adoration followed, and then with fresh strains of mystic music a new start for the deep took place. What the inner signification of these voyages might be I had not and have not the faintest idea; it is possible even that no one present knew. At the same time I do not doubt that the drama was originally instituted in order to commemorate some actual event or to symbolise some doctrine. On each voyage a hymn was sung or recited. On the first voyage the Brahman priest declaimed a hymn from the Vedas—a hymn that may have been written 3, 000 years ago—nor was there anything in the whole scene which appeared to me discordant with the notion that the clock had been put back 3, 000 years (though of course the actual new departure in the Brahmanical rites which we call Hinduism does not date back anything like so far as that). On the second voyage a Tamil hymn was sung by one of the youths trained in the temples for this purpose; and on the third voyage another Tamil hymn, with interludes of the most ecstatic caterwauling from chanks and bagpipes! The remainder of the voyages I did not witness, as my conductor now took me to visit the interior of the temple. That is, as far as it was permissible to penetrate. For the Brahman priests who regulate these things, with far-sighted policy make it one of their most stringent rules that the laity shall not have access beyond a short distance into the temple, and124 heathen like myself are of course confined to the mere forecourts. Thus the people feel more awe and sanctity with regard to the holy place itself and the priests who fearlessly tread within than they do with regard to anything else connected with their religion. Having passed the porch, we found ourselves in a kind of entrance hall with one or two rows of columns supporting a flat wooden roof—the walls adorned with the usual rude paintings of various events in Siva’s earthly career. On the right was a kind of shrine with a dancing figure of the god in relief—the perpetual dance of creation; but unlike some of the larger temples, in which there is often most elaborate and costly stonework, everything here was of the plainest, and there was hardly anything in the way of sculpture to be seen. Out of this forecourt opened a succession of chambers into which one might not enter; but the dwindling lights placed in each served to show distance after distance. In the extreme chamber farthest removed from the door, by which alone daylight enters—the rest of the interior being illumined night and day with artificial lights—is placed, surrounded by lamps, the most sacred object, the lingam. This of course was too far off to be discerned—and indeed it is, except on occasions, kept covered—but it appears that instead of being a rude image of the male organ (such as is frequently seen in the outer courts of these temples), the thing is a certain white stone, blue-veined and of an egg-shape, which is mysteriously fished up—if the gods so will it—from the depths of the river Nerbudda, and only thence.125 It stands in the temple in the hollow of another oval-shaped object which represents the female yoni; and the two together, embleming Siva and Sakti, stand for the sexual energy which pervades creation.",
        "target_summary": "The narrator, an Englishman, observed the crowd watching him during a religious ceremony; his unusual presence, while drawing inquiring gazes, was generally accepted due to his companion's authority. Some onlookers appeared shocked, others pleased or proud, and a few acquaintances offered friendly glances.\n\nA gyrating raft made several voyages, each return to shore marked by fresh offerings, a bell ringing, hushed adoration, and mystic music preceding its next departure. The exact meaning of these voyages was unclear to the narrator, perhaps to all present, though he believed they likely commemorated an event or symbolized a doctrine. Hymns accompanied each journey: an ancient Vedic hymn on the first, reflecting the scene's archaic feel, followed by two Tamil hymns on subsequent voyages, the third featuring ecstatic chank and bagpipe music. The narrator departed before the ceremony concluded, as his companion led him into the temple.\n\nAccess to the temple's interior was highly restricted by Brahman priests, confining the laity and \"heathens\" like the narrator to the forecourts to preserve the sanctity and awe surrounding the inner sanctum and its officiants. Inside the porch, an entrance hall with columns and a flat wooden roof displayed simple paintings of Siva's life. A plain shrine with a dancing Siva relief, symbolizing creation, contrasted with the elaborate adornments of larger temples. Beyond this forecourt, a series of dimly lit, inaccessible chambers hinted at the deeper interior.\n\nIn the innermost, farthest chamber, perpetually illuminated, lay the lingam, the most sacred object, surrounded by lamps. Though too distant to be clearly seen and typically covered, it was described as an egg-shaped, blue-veined white stone, believed to be mysteriously fished from the Nerbudda river, rather than a crude male organ image. This lingam rested within an oval object representing the female yoni; together, they symbolized Siva and Sakti, embodying the creative sexual energy of the universe.",

        "content": "Thus the worship of sex is found to lie at the root of the present Hinduism, as it does at the root of nearly all the primitive religions of the world. Yet it would be a mistake to conclude that such worship is a mere deification of material functions. Whenever it may have been that the Vedic prophets descending from Northern lands into India first discovered within themselves that capacity of spiritual ecstasy which has made them even down to to-day one of the greatest religious forces in the world, it is certain that they found (as indeed many of the mediæval Christian seers at a later time also found) that this ecstasy had a certain similarity to the sexual rapture. In their hands therefore the rude, phallic worships, which their predecessors had with true instinct celebrated, came to have a new meaning; and sex itself, the most important of earthly functions, came to derive an even greater importance from its relation to the one supreme and heavenly fact, that of the soul’s union with God. In the middle line of all Hindu temples, between the lingam and the door, are placed two other very sacred objects—the couchant bull Nandi and an upright ornamented pole, the Kampam, or as it is sometimes called, the flagstaff. In this case the bull was about four feet in length, carved in one block of stone, which from continual anointing by pious worshipers had become quite black and lustrous on126 the surface. In the great temple at Tanjore there is a bull twenty feet long cut from a single block of syenite, and similar bull-images are to be found in great numbers in these temples, and of all sizes down to a foot in length, and in any accessible situation are sure to be black and shining with oil. In Tamil the word pasu signifies both ox—i.e. the domesticated ox—and the soul. Siva is frequently represented as riding on a bull; and the animal represents the human soul which has become subject and affiliated to the god. As to the flagstaff, it was very plain, and appeared to be merely a wooden pole nine inches or so thick, slightly ornamented, and painted a dull red color. In the well-known temple at Mádura the kampam is made of teak plated with gold, and is encircled with certain rings at intervals, and at the top three horizontal arms project, with little bell-like tassels hanging from them. This curious object has, it is said, a physiological meaning, and represents a nerve which passes up the median line of the body from the genital organs to the brain (? the great sympathetic). Indeed the whole disposition of the parts in these temples is supposed (as of course also in the Christian Churches) to represent the human body, and so also the universe of which the human body is only the miniature. I do not feel myself in a position however to judge how far these correspondences are exact. The inner chambers in this particular temple were, as far as I could see, very plain and unornamented. On coming out again into the open space in front of the porch, my attention was directed to some low127 buildings which formed the priests’ quarters. Two priests were attached to the temple, and a separate cottage was intended for any traveling priest or lay benefactor who might want accommodation within the precincts. And now the second act of the sacred drama was commencing. The god, having performed a sufficient number of excursions on the tank, was being carried back with ceremony to the space in front of the porch—where for some time had been standing, on portable platforms made of poles, three strange animal figures of more than life-size—a bull, a peacock, and a black creature somewhat resembling a hog, but I do not know what it was meant for. On the back of the bull, which was evidently itself in an amatory and excited mood, Siva and Sakti were placed; on the hog-like animal was mounted another bejewelled figure—that of Ganésa, Siva’s son; and on the peacock again the figure of his other son, Soubramánya. Camphor flame was again offered, and then a lot of stalwart and enthusiastic worshipers seized the poles, and mounting the platforms on their shoulders set themselves to form a procession round the temple on the grassy space between it and the outer wall. The musicians as usual went first, then came the dancing girls, and then after an interval of twenty or thirty yards the three animals abreast of each other on their platforms, and bearing their respective gods upon their backs. At this point we mingled with the crowd and were lost among the worshipers. And now again I was reminded of representations of antique religious processions. The people, going in front or following128 behind, or partly filling the space in front of the gods—though leaving a lane clear in the middle—were evidently getting elated and excited. They swayed their arms, took hands or rested them on each other’s bodies, and danced rather than walked along; sometimes their shouts mixed with the music; the tall torches swayed to and fro, flaring to the sky and distilling burning drops on naked backs in a way which did not lessen the excitement; the smell of hot coco-nut oil mingling with that of humanity made the air sultry; and the great leaves of bananas and other palms leaning over and glistening with the double lights of moon and torch flames gave a weird and tropical beauty to the scene.2 In this rampant way the procession moved for a few yards, the men wrestling and sweating under the weight of the god-images, which according to orthodox ideas are always made of an alloy of the five metals known to the ancients—an alloy called panchaloka—and are certainly immensely heavy; and then it came to a stop. The bearers rested their poles on strong crutches carried for the purpose, and while they took breath the turn of the nautch girls came.",
        "target_summary": "The worship of sex is identified as foundational to Hinduism, mirroring its role in many primitive religions. However, this was not merely a deification of material functions. Vedic prophets, experiencing a spiritual ecstasy akin to sexual rapture, transformed crude phallic worship into a profound symbol. Sex, as a vital earthly function, thus gained greater significance through its connection to the supreme heavenly fact: the soul's union with God.\n\nHindu temples incorporate sacred objects in their central line, between the lingam and the door. These include the couchant bull Nandi and the upright ornamented pole, the Kampam (flagstaff). Nandi, often a large stone carving like the twenty-foot bull at Tanjore, appears black and lustrous from continuous anointing. In Tamil, \"pasu\" signifies both ox and soul; as Siva rides a bull, Nandi symbolizes the human soul subject to God. The Kampam, a plain wooden pole nine inches thick, sometimes adorned and painted red, or gold-plated teak with rings and projecting arms as in Mádura, is believed to have a physiological meaning. It reportedly represents a nerve passing from the genital organs to the brain, aligning with the idea that the temple's overall layout, like Christian churches, represents the human body and, by extension, the universe. The inner chambers of the described temple appeared very plain. Nearby buildings served as priests' quarters, including space for traveling clergy or benefactors.\n\nThe excerpt details a ceremonial procession where deities, having completed excursions, were ceremonially returned to the porch area. Here, three large animal figures on portable platforms awaited: a bull, a peacock, and a hog-like creature. Siva and Sakti were placed on the bull, Ganesha (Siva's son) on the hog-like animal, and Soubramánya (his other son) on the peacock. After camphor offerings, enthusiastic worshipers seized the poles, carrying the immensely heavy god-images (made of the five-metal alloy panchaloka) in a procession around the temple on the grassy space between it and the outer wall. Musicians led, followed by dancing girls, and then the three animal platforms carrying their respective deities. The crowd became visibly elated and excited, swaying, dancing, and shouting, their voices mixing with the music. Tall torches swayed, flaring and dripping burning drops, intensifying the excitement. The sultry air, thick with the smell of hot coconut oil and humanity, combined with palm leaves glistening in moonlight and torch flames, created a \"weird and tropical beauty.\" The procession moved slowly, men wrestling and sweating under the weight, periodically pausing for the nautch girls' performance.",

        "content": "Most people are sufficiently familiar now-a-days, through Oriental exhibitions and the like, with the129 dress and bearing of these Devadásis, or servants of God. “They sweep the temple,” says the author of Life in an Indian Village, “ornament the floor with quaint figures drawn in rice flour, hold the sacred light before the god, fan him, and dance and sing when required.” “In the village of Kélambakam,” he continues, “there are two dancing girls, Kanakambujam and Minakshi. K. is the concubine of a neighboring Mudelliar, and M. of Appalacharri the Brahman. But their services can be obtained by others.” I will describe the dress of one of the four present on this occasion. She had on a dark velveteen tunic with quite short gold-edged sleeves, the tunic almost concealed from view by a very handsome scarf or sari such as the Indian women wear. This sari, made of crimson silk profusely130 ornamented with gold thread, was passed over one shoulder, and having been wound twice or thrice round the waist was made to hang down like a petticoat to a little below the knee. Below this appeared silk leggings of an orange color; and heavy silver anklets crowned the naked feet. Handsome gold bangles were on her arms (silver being usually worn below the waist and gold above), jewels and bell-shaped pendants in her nose and ears, and on her head rose-colored flowers pinned with gold brooches and profusely inwoven with the plaited black hair that hung down her back. The others with variations in color had much the same costume. To describe their faces is difficult. I think I seldom saw any so inanimately sad. It is part of the teaching of Indian women that they should never give way to the expression of feeling, or to any kind of excitement of manner, and this in the case of better types leads to a remarkable dignity and composure of bearing, such as is comparatively rare in the West, but in more stolid and ignorant sorts produces a most apathetic and bovine mien. In the case of these nautch women circumstances are complicated by the prostitution which seems to be the inevitable accompaniment of their profession. One might indeed think that it was distinctly a part of their profession—as women attached to the service of temples whose central idea is that of sex—but some of my Hindu friends assure me that this is not so: that they live where they like, that their dealings with the other sex are entirely their own affair, and are not regulated or recognised in any way by the temple authorities, and that it is only, so131 to speak, an accident that these girls enter into commercial relations with men—generally, it is admitted, with the wealthier of those who attend the services—an accident of course quite likely to occur, since they are presumably good-looking, and are early forced into publicity and out of the usual routine of domestic life. All the same, though doubtless these things are so now, I think it may fairly be supposed that the sexual services of these nautch girls were at one time a recognised part of their duty to the temple to which they were attached. Seeing indeed that so many of the religions of antiquity are known to have recognised services of this kind, seeing also that Hinduism did at least incorporate in itself primitive sexual worships, and seeing that there is no reason to suppose that such practices involved any slur in primitive times on those concerned in them—rather the reverse—I think we have at any rate a strong primâ-facie case. It is curious too that, even to-day, notwithstanding the obvious drawbacks of their life, these girls are quite recognised and accepted in Hindu families of high standing and respectability. When marriages take place they dress the bride, put on her jewels, and themselves act as bridesmaids; and generally speaking are much referred to as authorities on dress. Whatever, however, may have been the truth about the exact duties and position of the Devadásis in old times, the four figuring away there before their gods that night seemed to me to present but a melancholy and effete appearance. They were small and even stunted in size, nor could it be said that any of them were decently good-looking. The face of the132 eldest—it was difficult to judge their age, but she might have been twenty—was the most expressive, but it was thin and exceedingly weary; the faces of the others were the faces of children who had ceased to be children, yet to whom experience had brought no added capacity. These four waifs of womanhood, then, when the procession stopped, wheeled round, and facing the god approached him with movements which bore the remotest resemblance to a dance. Stretching out their right hands and right feet together (in itself an ungraceful movement) they made one step forward and to the right; then doing the same with left hands and feet made a step in advance to the left. After repeating this two or three times they then, having first brought their finger points to their shoulders, extended their arms forward towards the deity, inclining themselves at the same time. This also was repeated, and then they moved back much as they had advanced. After a few similar evolutions, sometimes accompanied by chanting, they wheeled round again, and the procession moved forwards a few yards more. Thus we halted about half a dozen times before we completed the circuit of the temple, and each time had a similar performance.",
        "target_summary": "Devadasis, or \"servants of God,\" are familiar figures known for their temple duties: sweeping, ornamenting floors, tending sacred lights, fanning the deity, and performing dances and songs. While often serving as concubines for wealthier patrons, their services are also available to others.\n\nTheir elaborate attire typically includes a dark velveteen tunic with short, gold-edged sleeves, mostly covered by a crimson silk sari profusely ornamented with gold thread. This sari is draped over one shoulder, wound around the waist, and hangs like a petticoat to below the knee. Orange silk leggings, heavy silver anklets, gold bangles, and various jewels—including nose and ear pendants—complete the look, with rose-colored flowers and gold brooches woven into their plaited black hair.\n\nTheir faces commonly convey an \"inanimately sad\" expression, often appearing apathetic or \"bovine,\" diverging from the dignified composure expected from Indian women taught to suppress overt emotional display. The author notes that prostitution frequently accompanies their profession. While some Hindu friends claim their sexual dealings are purely personal and not regulated by temple authorities, the author speculates that, given the historical context of primitive sexual worship within Hinduism and similar practices in ancient religions, sexual services were likely once a recognized part of their temple duties, rather than merely an \"accident\" of their public exposure and attractiveness. Despite the perceived drawbacks of their lifestyle, Devadasis maintain social acceptance, often assisting high-standing Hindu families by dressing brides, acting as bridesmaids, and serving as fashion authorities.\n\nThe specific Devadasis observed by the author were small, somewhat stunted, and not conventionally attractive. Their faces ranged from thin and weary to profoundly unexpressive, like children who had gained no insight from experience. Their \"dance\" during the temple procession was described as rudimentary and ungraceful: simple, repetitive steps forward (alternating right hand/foot then left hand/foot), followed by extending arms towards the deity while inclining themselves, and then retreating. These brief, simple evolutions, sometimes accompanied by chanting, were repeated several times as the procession circled the temple.",

        "content": "On coming round to the porch what might be called the third act commenced. The platform of the bull and the god Siva was—not without struggles—lowered to the ground so as to face the porch, the other two gods being kept in the background; and then the four girls, going into the temple and bringing forth little oil-lamps, walked in133 single file round the image, followed by the musicians also in single file. These latter had all through the performance kept up an almost continuous blowing; and their veined knotted faces and distended cheeks bore witness to the effort, not to mention the state of our own ears! It must however in justice be said that the drone, the flageolet, and the trumpets were tuned to the same key-note, and their combined music alone would not have been bad; but a chank-shell can no more be tuned than a zebra can be tamed, and when two of these instruments together, blown by two wiry old men obdurately swaying their heads, were added to the tumult, it seemed not impossible that one might go giddy and perhaps become theopneustos, at any moment. The show was now evidently culminating. The entry of the musicians into the temple, where their reverberations were simply appalling, was the signal for an inrush of the populace. We passed in with the crowd, and almost immediately Siva, lifted from the bull, followed borne in state under his parasol. He was placed on a stand in front of the side shrine in the forecourt already mentioned; and a curtain being drawn before him, there was a momentary hush and awe. The priest behind the curtain (whom from our standpoint we could see) now made the final offerings of fruit, flowers and sandalwood, and lighted the five-branched camphor lamp for the last time. This burning of camphor is, like other things in the service, emblematic. The five lights represent the five senses. As camphor consumes itself and leaves no residue behind, so should the five senses, being offered to God, consume themselves134 and disappear. When this is done, that happens in the soul which was now figured in the temple service; for as the last of the camphor burned itself away the veil was swiftly drawn aside—and there stood the image of Siva revealed in a blaze of light. The service was now over. The priest distributed the offerings among the people; the torches were put out; and in a few minutes I was walking homeward through the streets and wondering if I was really in the modern world of the 19th century.",
        "target_summary": "The ceremony entered its third act as the platform bearing the bull and the god Siva was laboriously lowered to face the porch, while other deities remained in the background. Four girls, carrying oil-lamps, and then the musicians, processed in single file around the image. The musicians had maintained continuous, strenuous blowing throughout, their combined drone, flageolet, and trumpets forming a tuned base. However, the addition of two untuned chank-shells, blown by swaying old men, created a tumultuous cacophony that threatened to induce giddiness.\n\nAs the show culminated, the musicians’ entry into the temple, causing appalling reverberations, signaled a rush of the populace.

The service concluded, offerings were distributed, torches extinguished, and the narrator walked home, pondering if he was truly in the modern 19th century.",

        "content": "During my stay in Ceylon I was fortunate enough to make the acquaintance of one of the esoteric teachers of the ancient religious mysteries. These Gurus or Adepts are to be found scattered all over the mainland of India; but they lead a secluded existence, avoiding the currents of Western civilisation—which are obnoxious to them—and rarely come into contact with the English or appear on the surface of ordinary life. They are divided into two great schools, the Himalayan and South Indian—formed probably, even centuries back, by the gradual retirement of the adepts into the mountains and forests of their respective districts before the spread of foreign races and civilisations over the general continent. The Himalayan school has carried on the more democratic and progressive Buddhistic tradition, while the South Indian has kept more to caste, and to the ancient Brahmanical and later Hindu lines. This separation has led to divergencies in philosophy, and there are even (so strong is sectional feeling in all ranges of human activity) slight jealousies between the adherents of the two schools; but the differences are probably after all very superficial; in essence their teaching and their work may I think be said to be the same.138 The teacher to whom I allude belongs to the South Indian school, and was only sojourning for a time in Ceylon. When I first made his acquaintance he was staying in the precincts of a Hindu temple. Passing through the garden and the arcade-like porch of the temple with its rude and grotesque frescoes of the gods—Siva astride the bull, Sakti, his consort, seated behind him, etc.—we found ourselves in a side-chamber, where seated on a simple couch, his bed and day-seat in one, was an elderly man (some seventy years of age, though he did not look nearly as much as that) dressed only in a white muslin wrapper wound loosely round his lithe and even active dark brown form: his head and face shaven a day or two past, very gentle and spiritual in expression, like the best type of Roman Catholic priest—a very beautiful full and finely formed mouth, straight nose and well-formed chin, dark eyes, undoubtedly the eyes of a seer, dark-rimmed eyelids, and a powerful, prophetic, and withal childlike manner. He soon lapsed into exposition which he continued for an hour or two with but few interjections from his auditors. At a later time he moved into a little cottage where for several weeks I saw him nearly every day. Every day the same—generally sitting on his couch, with bare arms and feet, the latter often coiled under him—only requiring a question to launch off into a long discourse—fluent, and even rapt, with ready and vivid illustration and long digressions, but always returning to the point. Though unfortunately my knowledge of Tamil was so slight that I could not follow his conversation and had to take advantage139 of the services of a friend as interpreter, still it was easy to see what a remarkable vigor and command of language the fellow had, what power of concentration on the subject in hand, and what a wealth of reference—especially citation from ancient authorities—wherewith to illustrate his discourse. Everything in the East is different from the West, and so are the methods of teaching. Teaching in the East is entirely authoritative and traditional. That is its strong point and also its defect. The pupil is not expected to ask questions of a sceptical nature or expressive of doubt; the teacher does not go about to “prove” his thesis to the pupil, or support it with arguments drawn from the plane of the pupil’s intelligence; he simply re-delivers to the pupil, in a certain order and sequence, the doctrines which were delivered to him in his time, which have been since verified by his own experience, and which he can illustrate by phrases and metaphors and citations drawn from the sacred books. He has of course his own way of presenting the whole, but the body of knowledge which he thus hands down is purely traditional, and may have come along for thousands of years with little or no change. Originality plays no part in the teaching of the Indian Sages. The knowledge which they have to impart is of a kind in which invention is not required. It purports to be a knowledge of the original fact of the universe itself—something behind which no man can go. The West may originate, the West may present new views of the prime fact—the East only seeks to give to a man that fact itself, the supreme consciousness, undifferentiated, the key to all that exists.",

They are divided into two main schools: the Himalayan, which carries on a more democratic, Buddhistic tradition, and the South Indian, adhering more to caste and ancient Brahmanical/Hindu lines. These schools likely formed centuries ago as adepts retreated before the spread of foreign cultures. While philosophical divergencies and even \"slight jealousies\" exist, their core teaching is considered fundamentally the same.\n\nThe narrator's teacher belonged to the South Indian school and was temporarily in Ceylon. Their initial encounter occurred within a Hindu temple's side-chamber, after passing its garden and arcade-like porch adorned with \"rude and grotesque frescoes of the gods.\" The teacher, an elderly man of about seventy who appeared much younger, sat on a simple couch, dressed in a loose white muslin wrapper around his \"lithe and even active dark brown form.\" His recently shaven head and face displayed a \"very gentle and spiritual expression,\" likened to the best type of Roman Catholic priest, with a beautiful mouth, straight nose, well-formed chin, and \"dark eyes, undoubtedly the eyes of a seer,\" conveying a \"powerful, prophetic, and withal childlike manner.\" He soon launched into an exposition lasting an hour or two.

Eastern teaching is entirely authoritative and traditional, which is both its strength and defect. Pupils are not expected to ask skeptical questions; the teacher does not \"prove\" his thesis based on the pupil's intelligence. Instead, the teacher re-delivers, in a specific order, doctrines received by him, verified by his own experience, and illustrated by sacred texts. While his presentation is unique, the knowledge itself is purely traditional, possibly thousands of years old with minimal change. Originality holds no part for Indian Sages, as the knowledge they impart is not about invention but about the \"original fact of the universe itself\"—a truth beyond human fabrication. Unlike the West, which may originate new views of this prime fact, the East aims to directly convey that fact itself: the supreme, undifferentiated consciousness, which is the key to all existence.",

        "content": "The Indian teachers therefore say there are as a rule three conditions of the attainment of Divine knowledge or gñánam:—(1) The study of the sacred books, (2) the help of a Guru, and (3) the verification of the tradition by one’s own experience. Without this last the others are of course of no use; and the chief aid of the Guru is directed to the instruction of the pupil in the methods by which he may attain to personal experience. The sacred books give the philosophy and some of the experiences of the gñáni or illuminated person, but they do not, except in scattered hints, give instruction as to how this illumination is to be obtained. The truth is, it is a question of evolution; and it would neither be right that such instruction should be given to everybody, nor indeed possible, since even in the case of those prepared for it the methods must differ, according to the idiosyncrasy and character of the pupil. There are apparently isolated cases in which individuals attain to Gñánam through their own spontaneous development, and without instruction from a Guru, but these are rare. As a rule every man who is received into the body of Adepts receives his initiation through another Adept who himself received it from a fore-runner, and the whole constitutes a kind of church or brotherhood with genealogical branches so to speak—the line of adepts from which a man descends being imparted to him on his admission into the fraternity. I need not say that this resembles the methods of the ancient mysteries and initiations of classic times; and indeed the Indian teachers claim that the Greek and141 Egyptian and other Western schools of arcane lore were merely branches, more or less degenerate, of their own. The course of preparation for Gñánam is called yogam, and the person who is going through this stage is called a yogi—from the root yog, to join—one who is seeking junction with the universal spirit. Yogis are common all over India, and exist among all classes and in various forms. Some emaciate themselves and torture their bodies, others seek only control over their minds, some retire into the jungles and mountains, others frequent the cities and exhibit themselves in the crowded fairs, others again carry on the avocations of daily life with but little change of outward habit. Some are humbugs, led on by vanity or greed of gain (for to give to a holy man is highly meritorious); others are genuine students or philosophers; some are profoundly imbued with the religious sense, others by mere distaste for the world. The majority probably take to a wandering life of the body, some become wandering in mind; a great many attain to phases of clairvoyance and abnormal power of some kind or other, and a very few become adepts of a high order. Anyhow the matter cannot be understood unless it is realised that this sort of religious retirement is thoroughly accepted and acknowledged all over India, and excites no surprise or special remark. Only some five or six years ago the son of the late Rajah of Tanjore—a man of some forty or fifty years of age, and of course the chief native personage in that part of India—made up his mind to become a devotee. He one day told his friends he was142 going on a railway journey, sent off his servants and carriages from the palace to the station, saying he would follow, gave them the slip, and has never been heard of since! His friends went to the man who was known to have been acting as his Guru, who simply told them, “You will never find him.” Supposing the G.O.M. or the Prince of Wales were to retire like this—how odd it would seem! To illustrate this subject I may tell the story of Tilleináthan Swámy, who was the teacher of the Guru whose acquaintance I am referring to in this chapter. Tilleináthan was a wealthy shipowner of high family. In 1850 he devoted himself to religious exercises, till 1855, when he became “emancipated.” After his attainment he felt sick of the world, and so he wound up his affairs, divided all his goods and money among relations and dependents, and went off stark naked into the woods. His mother and sisters were grieved and repeatedly pursued him, offering to surrender all to him if he would only return. At last he simply refused to answer their importunities, and they desisted. He appeared in Tanjore after that in ’57, ’59, ’64 and ’72, but has not been seen since. He is supposed to be living somewhere in the Western Ghauts.",
        "target_summary": "Indian teachers outline three conditions for attaining Divine knowledge (gñánam): studying sacred texts, receiving guidance from a Guru, and crucially, verifying tradition through personal experience. The Guru's primary role is to instruct pupils in methods to achieve this personal experience, as sacred books offer philosophy and gñáni experiences but only scattered hints on *how* to achieve illumination. Gñánam is an evolutionary process, and its methods are tailored to individual character, making it unsuitable for universal instruction.\n\nWhile spontaneous gñánam is rare, most individuals enter the body of Adepts through initiation by another Adept, forming a lineage or spiritual brotherhood—a system claimed by Indian teachers to be the origin of ancient Greek and Egyptian arcane schools.\n\nThe preparatory path for gñánam is called yogam, and those on it are yogis, seeking union with the universal spirit. Yogis are prevalent across all classes in India and exhibit diverse practices: some pursue severe physical austerity, others focus solely on mental control, and they might live in solitude or publicly in cities. Motivations vary from genuine philosophical inquiry and religious devotion to vanity or greed. Many yogis develop clairvoyance or abnormal powers, though very few become high-order Adepts.\n\nThis kind of religious retirement is widely accepted in India, causing no surprise. For instance, the forty-year-old son of the Rajah of Tanjore once faked a railway journey to disappear and become a devotee, never to be seen again, with his Guru simply stating he wouldn't be found. Similarly, Tilleináthan Swámy, a wealthy shipowner, renounced the world in 1855 after five years of religious exercises, distributing his wealth and becoming a naked ascetic despite his family's pleas. He reappeared periodically in Tanjore but has not been seen since 1872, believed to be living in the Western Ghauts.",

        "content": "In ’58 or ’59, at the close of the Indian Mutiny, when search was being made for Nana Sahib, it was reported that the Nana was hiding himself under the garb (or no garb) of an “ascetic,” and orders were issued to detain and examine all such people. Tilleináthan was taken and brought before the sub-magistrate at Tanjore, who told him the Government orders, and that he must dress himself143 properly. At the same time the sub-magistrate, having a friendly feeling for T. and guessing that he would refuse obedience, had brought a wealthy merchant with him, whom he had persuaded to stand bail for Tilleináthan in such emergency. When however the merchant saw Tilleináthan, he expressed his doubts about standing bail for him—whereupon T. said, “Quite right, it is no good your standing bail for me; the English Government itself could not stand bail for one who creates and destroys Governments. I will be bail for myself.” The sub-magistrate then let him go. But on the matter being reported at head-quarters the sub. was reprimanded, and a force, consisting of an inspector and ten men (natives of course), was sent to take Tilleináthan. He at first refused and threatened them, but on the inspector pleading that he would be dismissed if he returned with empty hands T. consented to come “in order to save the inspector.” They came into full court—as it happened—before the collector (Morris), who immediately reprimanded T. for his mad costume! “It is you that are mad,” said the latter, “not to know that this is my right costume,”—and he proceeded to explain the four degrees of Hindu probation and emancipation. (These are, of course, the four stages of student, householder, yogi and gñáni. Every one who becomes a gñáni must pass through the other three stages. Each stage has its appropriate costume and rules; the yogi wears a yellow garment; the gñáni is emancipated from clothing, as well as from all other troubles.) Finally T. again told the collector that he was a144 fool, and that he T. would punish him. “What will you do?” said the collector. “If you don’t do justice I will burn you,” was the reply! At this the mass of the people in court trembled, believing no doubt implicitly in T.’s power to fulfil his threat. The collector however told the inspector to read the Lunacy Act to Tilleináthan, but the inspector’s hand shook so that he could hardly see the words—till T. said, “Do not be afraid—I will explain it to you.” He then gave a somewhat detailed account of the Act, pointed out to the collector that it did not apply to his own case, and ended by telling him once more that he was a fool. The collector then let him go! Afterwards Morris—having been blamed for letting the man go—and Beauchamp (judge), who had been rather impressed already by T.’s personality, went together and with an escort to the house in Tanjore in which Tilleináthan was then staying—with an undefined intention, apparently, of arresting him. T. then asked them if they thought he was under their Government—to which the Englishmen replied that they were not there to argue philosophy but to enforce the law. T. asked how they would enforce it. “We have cannons and men behind us,” said Morris. “And I,” said T., “can also bring cannons and forces greater than yours.” They then left him again, and he was no more troubled. This story is a little disappointing in that no miracles come off, but I tell it as it was told to me by the Guru, and my friend A. having heard it substantially the same from other and independent witnesses at Tanjore it may be taken as giving a145 fairly correct idea of the kind of thing that occasionally happens. No doubt the collector would look upon Tilleináthan as a “luny”—and from other stories I have heard of him (his utter obliviousness of ordinary conventionalities and proprieties, that he would lie down to sleep in the middle of the street to the great inconvenience of traffic, that he would sometimes keep on repeating a single vacant phrase over and over again for half a day, etc.), such an opinion might, I should say, fairly be justified. Yet at the same time there is no doubt he was a very remarkable man, and the deep reverence with which our friend the Guru spoke of him was obviously not accorded merely to the abnormal powers which he seems at times to have manifested, but to the profundity and breadth of his teaching and the personal grandeur which prevailed through all his eccentricities. It was a common and apparently instinctive practice with him to speak of the great operations of Nature, the thunder, the wind, the shining of the sun, etc., in the first person, “I”—the identification with, or non-differentiation from the universe (which is the most important of esoteric doctrines) being in his case complete. So also the democratic character of his teaching surpassed even our Western records. He would take a pariah dog—the most scorned of creatures—and place it round his neck (compare the pictures of Christ with a lamb in the same attitude), or even let it eat out of one plate with himself! One day, in Tanjore, when importuned for instruction by five or six disciples, he rose up and saying, “Follow me,” went through the streets to the edge of a brook146 which divided the pariah village from the town—a line which no Hindu of caste will ever cross—and stepping over the brook bade them enter the defiled ground. This ordeal however his followers could not endure, and—except one—they all left him.",
        "target_summary": "During the 1858-59 Indian Mutiny, Tilleináthan, an ascetic, was detained in Tanjore under orders to examine such individuals. A sub-magistrate asked him to dress properly and arranged for bail, but the merchant refused to stand for him. Tilleináthan then declared he could bail himself, claiming power over governments, and was released. However, the sub-magistrate was reprimanded.\n\nAn inspector and ten men were then sent to arrest Tilleináthan. He initially refused but agreed to prevent the inspector's dismissal. Brought before Collector Morris, Tilleináthan was reprimanded for his \"mad\" attire. He responded that it was the proper costume of a gñáni, representing the final stage of Hindu emancipation from worldly conventions, including clothing. Calling Morris a fool, Tilleináthan threatened to \"burn\" him if he failed to deliver justice, terrifying the court. When Morris ordered the Lunacy Act to be read, a fearful inspector couldn't. Tilleináthan proceeded to explain the Act himself, asserted its irrelevance to his case, and again called Morris a fool, leading to his second release.\n\nSubsequently, Morris (who had been blamed for letting Tilleináthan go) and an impressed Judge Beauchamp confronted Tilleináthan at his residence with an escort, intending to arrest him. Tilleináthan questioned their authority over him. When Morris invoked \"cannons and men,\" Tilleináthan claimed superior forces. The officials left him undisturbed, and he faced no further trouble.\n\nThe author notes this story, though lacking miracles, is corroborated and reflects Tilleináthan's character. While authorities might deem him eccentric—given his disregard for social norms, such as sleeping in the middle of a street or repeating phrases for hours—he was revered as a remarkable man. His guru esteemed him not just for unusual powers but for profound teaching, personal grandeur, and his complete identification with the universe (speaking of natural operations in the first person, \"I\"). His radical democratic views were demonstrated by treating a pariah dog with utmost reverence and by leading disciples across a brook into a forbidden pariah village, an act so challenging that only one disciple remained.",

        "content": "Tilleináthan’s pupil, the teacher of whom I am presently speaking, is married and has a wife and children. Most of these “ascetics” think nothing of abandoning their families when the call comes to them, and of going to the woods perhaps never to be seen again. He however has not done this, but lives on quietly at home at Tanjore. Thirty or forty years ago he was a kind of confidential friend and adviser to the then reigning prince of Tanjore, and was well up in traditional state-craft and politics; and even only two or three years ago took quite an active interest in the National Indian Congress. His own name was Ramaswámy, but he acquired the name Elúkhanam, “the Grammarian,” on account of his proficiency in Tamil grammar and philosophy, on which subject he was quite an authority, even before his initiation. Tamil is a very remarkable, and indeed complex language—rivaling the Sanskrit in the latter respect. It belongs to the Dravidian group, and has few Aryan roots in it except what have been borrowed from Sanskrit. It contains however an extraordinary number of philosophical terms, of which some are Sanskrit in their origin, but many are entirely its own; and like the people it forms a strange blend of practical qualities with the most inveterate occultism. “Tamil,” says the author of an article in the Theosophist for November, ’90, “is one of the oldest languages of India, if not of the world. Its147 birth and infancy are enveloped in mythology. As in the case of Sanskrit, we cannot say when Tamil became a literary language. The oldest Tamil works extant belong to a time, about 2, 000 years ago, of high and cultured refinement in Tamil poetic literature. All the religious and philosophical poetry of Sanskrit has become fused into Tamil, which language contains a larger number of popular treatises in Occultism, Alchemy, etc., than even Sanskrit; and it is now the only spoken language of India that abounds in occult treatises on various subjects.” Going on to speak of the Tamil Adepts, the author of this article says: “The popular belief is that there were eighteen brotherhoods of Adepts scattered here and there, in the mountains and forests of the Tamil country, and presided over by eighteen Sadhoos; and that there was a grand secret brotherhood composed of the eighteen Sadhoos, holding its meetings in the hills of the Agasthya Kútam in the Tinnevelly district. Since the advent of the English and their mountaineering and deforestation, these occultists have retired far into the interior of the thick jungles on the mountains; and a large number have, it is believed, altogether left these parts for more congenial places in the Himalayan ranges. It is owing to their influence that the Tamil language has been inundated, as it were, with a vast number of works on esoteric philosophy. The works of Agasthya Muni alone3 would fill a whole library. The chief and only object of these brotherhoods has been to popularise esoteric truths and bring them home to the masses. So great and so extensive is148 their influence that the Tamil literature is permeated with esoteric truths in all its ramifications.” In fact the object of this article is to point out the vast number of proverbs and popular songs, circulating among the Tamils to-day, which conceal under frivolous guise the most profound mystic truths. The grammar too—as I suppose was the case in Sanskrit—is linked to the occult philosophy of the people.",
        "target_summary": "Tilleináthan’s pupil, Ramaswámy, known as Elúkhanam (\"the Grammarian\"), is married with children and lives in Tanjore, unlike many ascetics who abandon their families. Decades ago, he was a confidential friend and adviser to the prince of Tanjore, knowledgeable in state-craft and politics, and more recently, actively involved in the National Indian Congress. His name Elúkhanam reflects his exceptional proficiency in Tamil grammar and philosophy, subjects he mastered even before his initiation.\n\nThe Tamil language itself is remarkable and complex, rivaling Sanskrit. Belonging to the Dravidian group, it possesses few Aryan roots beyond those borrowed from Sanskrit, yet it contains an extraordinary number of philosophical terms, many unique to it. Tamil blends practical qualities with profound occultism. An article in *The Theosophist* (Nov. 1890) notes Tamil as one of India's oldest languages, its origins shrouded in mythology. Like Sanskrit, its exact emergence as a literary language is unknown, but extant works from about 2,000 years ago show high poetic refinement. Tamil has absorbed all the religious and philosophical poetry of Sanskrit and uniquely boasts more popular treatises on Occultism and Alchemy than even Sanskrit, making it the only spoken Indian language rich in such works.\n\nThe article also discusses Tamil Adepts, describing a popular belief in eighteen brotherhoods scattered across the Tamil country, presided over by Sadhoos, who formed a grand secret brotherhood meeting in the Agasthya Kútam hills. However, the advent of the English and their activities like mountaineering and deforestation prompted these occultists to retreat into deeper jungles or even to the Himalayas. Their significant influence is credited with saturating Tamil literature with extensive esoteric philosophy, as exemplified by the vast works of Agasthya Muni. The core objective of these brotherhoods was to popularize esoteric truths among the masses. This pervasive influence means that Tamil literature, including proverbs and popular songs, subtly conveys profound mystic truths, and even its grammar is linked to the people's occult philosophy.",

        "content": "To return to the Teacher, besides state-craft and grammar he is well versed in matters of law, and not unfrequently tackles a question of this kind for the help of his friends; and has some practical knowledge of medicine, as well as of cookery, which he considers important in its relation to health (the divine health, Sukham). It will thus be seen that he is a man of good practical ability and acquaintance with the world, and not a mere dreamer, as is too often assumed by Western critics to be the case with all those who seek the hidden knowledge of the East. In fact it is one of the remarkable points of the Hindu philosophy that practical knowledge of life is expressly inculcated as a preliminary stage to initiation. A man must be a householder before he becomes a yogi; and familiarity with sexual experience instead of being reprobated, is rather encouraged, in order that having experienced one may in time pass beyond it. Indeed it is not unfrequently maintained that the early marriage of the Hindus is advantageous in this respect, since a couple married at the age of fifteen or sixteen have by the time they are forty a grown-up family launched in life, and having circled worldly experience are then free to dedicate themselves to the work of “emancipation.”149 During his yoga period, which lasted about three years, his wife was very good to him and assisted him all she could. He was enjoined by his own teacher to refrain from speech and did so for about a year and a half, passing most of his time in fixed attitudes of meditation, and only clapping his hands when he wanted food, etc. Hardly anything shows more strongly the hold which these religious ideas have upon the people than the common willingness of the women to help their husbands in works of this kind, which beside the sore inconvenience of them, often deprive the family of its very means of subsistence and leave it dependent on the help of relations and others. But so it is. It is difficult for a Westerner even to begin to realise the conditions and inspirations of life in the East. Refraint from speech is not a necessary condition of initiation, but it is enjoined in some cases. (There might be a good many cases among the Westerners where it would be very desirable—with or without initiation!) “Many practising,” said the Guru one day, “have not spoken for twelve years—so that when freed they had lost the power of speech—babbled like babies—and took some time to recover it. But for two or three years you experience no disability.” “During my initiation,” he added, “I often wandered about the woods all night, and many times saw wild beasts, but they never harmed me—as indeed they cannot harm the initiated.” At the present time he lives (when at home) a secluded life, mostly absorbed in trance conditions—his chief external interest no doubt being the teaching of such people as are led to him, or he is led to150 instruct. When however he takes up any practical work he throws himself into it with that power and concentration which is peculiar to a “Master,” and which is the natural corollary of the power, of abstraction when healthily used. Among their own people these Gurus often have small circles of disciples, who receive the instruction of their master and in return are ever ready to attend upon his wants. Sometimes such little parties sit up all night alternately reading the sacred books and absorbing themselves in meditation. It appears that Elukhanam’s mother became his pupil and practised according to instructions, making good progress. One day however she told her son that she should die that night. “What, are you ill?” he said. “No,” she replied, “but I feel that I shall die.” Then he asked her what she desired to be done with her body. “Oh, tie a rope to it and throw it out into the street,” was her reply—meaning that it did not matter—a very strong expression, considering caste regulations on the subject. Nothing more was said, but that night at 3 a.m. as they and some friends were sitting up (cross-legged on the floor as usual) reading one of the sacred books, one of those present said, “But your mother does not move,”—and she was dead. When in Ceylon our friend was only staying temporarily in a cottage, with a servant to look after him, and though exceedingly animated and vigorous as I have described, when once embarked in exposition—capable of maintaining his discourse for hours with unflagging concentration—yet the moment such external call upon his faculties was at an end, 151 the interest that it had excited seemed to be entirely wiped from his mind; and the latter returned to that state of interior meditation and absorption in the contemplation of the world disclosed to the inner sense, which had apparently become his normal condition.",
        "target_summary": "The Teacher is skilled in state-craft, grammar, law (often assisting friends), medicine, and cookery (valued for its health relation, Sukham). This demonstrates his practical ability and worldly acquaintance, countering Western critics' common assumption that Eastern spiritual seekers are mere dreamers. Hindu philosophy, in fact, distinctly requires practical life knowledge as a preliminary to initiation; one must be a householder before becoming a yogi, and sexual experience is encouraged, not reprobated, to be transcended later. Early marriage is often cited as beneficial, allowing couples to raise families by forty and then pursue 'emancipation' after gaining worldly experience.\n\nDuring his approximately three-year yoga period, his wife provided significant support. He observed a year and a half of enjoined silence, meditating in fixed attitudes and only clapping for needs like food. The common willingness of Eastern women to support husbands in such spiritually demanding practices—despite the severe inconvenience, loss of family income, and reliance on relatives—highlights the profound influence of religious ideas in the East, a condition difficult for Westerners to comprehend. While not universally required, speech restraint is sometimes enjoined during initiation. The Guru noted that prolonged silence, like twelve years, can lead to temporary loss of speech, causing practitioners to \"babble like babies\" upon release, but two or three years cause no such disability. He also recounted wandering through woods at night during his initiation, encountering wild beasts unharmed, as they \"cannot harm the initiated.\"\n\nCurrently, at home, he lives a secluded life largely absorbed in trance, with his main external focus being teaching those drawn to him. When undertaking practical work, he applies \"Master\"-like power and concentration, a natural outcome of healthy abstraction. Gurus typically gather small circles of disciples who receive instruction and attend to their needs, sometimes spending entire nights reading sacred texts and meditating. Notably, Elukhanam's mother became his pupil, progressing well. One day, she calmly informed him she would die that night, despite not being ill. When asked about her body, she indifferently replied, \"tie a rope to it and throw it out into the street\"—a powerful statement considering caste regulations. That night, at 3 a.m., while sitting with others reading sacred books, she peacefully passed away.\n\nIn Ceylon, despite his temporary dwelling and a servant, the Teacher displayed animated, vigorous, and hours-long concentrated discourse when teaching. However, immediately after such external engagement, his interest would vanish, and he would revert to his normal state of deep interior meditation and absorption in the inner world.",

        "content": "I was in fact struck, and perhaps a little shocked, by the want of interest in things and persons around him displayed by the great man—not that, as I have said, he was not very helpful and considerate in special cases—but evidently that part of his nature which held him to the actual world was thinning out; and the personalities of attendants and of those he might have casual dealings with, or even the scenes and changes of external nature, excited in him only the faintest response. As I have said he seemed to spend the greater part of the twenty-four hours wrapt in contemplation, and this not in the woods, but in the interior of his own apartment. As a rule he only took a brief half-hour’s walk mornings and evenings, just along the road and back again, and this was the only time he passed out of doors. Certainly this utter independence of external conditions—the very small amount of food and exercise and even of sleep that he took, combined with the great vigor that he was capable of putting forth on occasion both bodily and mentally, and the perfect control he had over his faculties—all seemed to suggest the idea of his having access to some interior source of strength and nourishment. And indeed the general doctrine that the gñáni can thus attain to independence and maintain his body from interior sources alone (eat152 of the “hidden manna”) is one much cherished by the Hindus, and which our friend was never tired of insisting on. Finally, his face, while showing the attributes of the seer, the externally penetrating quick eye, and the expression of illumination—the deep mystic light within—showed also the prevailing sentiment of happiness behind it. Sandósiam, Sandósiam eppótham—“Joy, always joy”—was his own expression, oft repeated. Perhaps I have now said enough to show—what of course was sufficiently evident to me—that, however it may be disguised under trivial or even in some cases repellent coverings, there is some reality beneath all these—some body of real experience, of no little value and importance, which has been attained in India by a portion at any rate of those who have claimed it, and which has been handed down now through a vast number of centuries among the Hindu peoples as their most cherished and precious possession.",

        "content": "The question is, What is this experience? or rather—since an experience can really only be known to the person who experiences it—we may ask, “What is the nature of this experience?” And in trying to indicate an answer of some kind to this question I feel considerable diffidence, just for the very reason (for one) already mentioned—namely that it is so difficult or impossible for one person to give a true account of an experience which has occurred to another. If I could give the exact words of the teacher, without any bias derived either from myself or the interpreting friend, the case might be different; but that I cannot pretend to do; and if I could, the old-world scientific forms in which his thoughts were cast would probably only prove a stumbling-block and a source of confusion, instead of a help, to the reader. Indeed, even in the case of the sacred books, where we have a good deal of accessible and authoritative information, Western critics though for the most part agreeing that there is some real experience underlying, are sadly at variance as to what that experience may be. For these reasons I prefer not to attempt or pretend to give the exact teaching, unbiassed, of the Indian Gurus, or their experiences; but only to154 indicate as far as I can, in my own words, and in modern thought-forms, what I take to be the direction in which we must look for this ancient and world-old knowledge which has had so stupendous an influence in the East, and which indeed is still the main mark of its difference from the West. And first let me guard against an error which is likely to arise. It is very easy to assume, and very frequently assumed, in any case where a person is credited with the possession of an unusual faculty, that such person is at once lifted out of our sphere into a supernatural region, and possesses every faculty of that region. If for instance he or she is or is supposed to be clairvoyant, it is assumed that everything is or ought to be known to them; or if the person has shown what seems a miraculous power at any time or in any case, it is asked by way of discredit why he or she did not show a like power at other times or in other cases. Against all such hasty generalisations it is necessary to guard ourselves. If there is a higher form of consciousness attainable by man than that which he for the most part can claim at present, it is probable, nay certain, that it is evolving and will evolve but slowly, and with many a slip and hesitant pause by the way. In the far past of man and the animals consciousness of sensation and consciousness of self have been successively evolved—each of these mighty growths with innumerable branches and branchlets continually spreading. At any point in this vast experience, a new growth, a new form of consciousness, might well have seemed miraculous. What could be more marvelous than the first revealment155 of the sense of sight, what more inconceivable to those who had not experienced it, and what more certain than that the first use of this faculty must have been fraught with delusion and error? Yet there may be an inner vision which again transcends sight, even as far as sight transcends touch. It is more than probable that in the hidden births of time there lurks a consciousness which is not the consciousness of sensation and which is not the consciousness of self—or at least which includes and entirely surpasses these—a consciousness in which the contrast between the ego and the external world, and the distinction between subject and object, fall away. The part of the world into which such a consciousness admits us (call it supramundane or whatever you will) is probably at least as vast and complex as the part we know, and progress in that region at least equally slow and tentative and various, laborious, discontinuous, and uncertain. There is no sudden leap out of the back parlor onto Olympus; and the routes, when found, from one to the other, are long and bewildering in their variety. And of those who do attain to some portion of this region, we are not to suppose that they are at once demi-gods, or infallible. In many cases indeed the very novelty and strangeness of the experiences give rise to phantasmal trains of delusive speculation. Though we should expect, and though it is no doubt true on the whole, that what we should call the higher types of existing humanity are those most likely to come into possession of any new faculties which may be flying about, yet it is not always so;156 and there are cases, well recognised, in which persons of decidedly deficient or warped moral nature attain powers which properly belong to a high grade of evolution, and are correspondingly dangerous thereby. All this, or a great part of it, the Indian teachers insist on. They say—and I think this commends the reality of their experience—that there is nothing abnormal or miraculous about the matter; that the faculties acquired are on the whole the result of long evolution and training, and that they have distinct laws and an order of their own. They recognise the existence of persons of a demonic faculty, who have acquired powers of a certain grade without corresponding moral evolution; and they admit the rarity of the highest phases of consciousness and the fewness of those at present fitted for its attainment. With these little provisos then established I think we may go on to say that what the Gñáni seeks and obtains is a new order of consciousness—to which for want of a better we may give the name universal or cosmic consciousness, in contradistinction to the individual or special bodily consciousness with which we are all familiar. I am not aware that the exact equivalent of this expression “universal consciousness” is used in the Hindu philosophy; but the Sat-chit-ánanda Brahm to which every yogi aspires indicates the same idea: sat, the reality, the all pervading; chit, the knowing, perceiving; ánanda, the blissful—all these united in one manifestation of Brahm.",
        "target_summary": "The author expresses considerable diffidence in precisely defining a profound experience, likely a higher form of consciousness. Due to the inherent difficulty of accurately conveying another's experience, and the potential for ancient forms of expression to confuse modern readers, they prefer to indicate the \"direction\" of this ancient knowledge in contemporary terms.\n\nThey first caution against the common error of assuming that individuals with unusual faculties are automatically supernatural, infallible, or possess every advanced ability. Instead, the author posits that if a higher form of consciousness is attainable, it evolves slowly and with many hesitations, much like the past evolution of sensation and self-consciousness. Any new growth in consciousness might seem miraculous, as the first revelation of sight would have appeared to those without it, yet it is a natural progression.\n\nThis emerging consciousness transcends both sensation and self, dissolving the contrast between the ego and the external world, and the distinction between subject and object. This \"supramundane\" realm is likely vast and complex, with progress within it being slow, tentative, and discontinuous, without sudden leaps to perfection. Those who gain access to this region are not necessarily infallible, and the newness of such experiences can even lead to delusive speculation. While higher types of humanity are generally more likely to attain new faculties, individuals with morally deficient natures can also acquire significant powers, which can be dangerous.\n\nIndian teachers corroborate many of these points, emphasizing that these faculties are neither abnormal nor miraculous but are the result of long evolution and training, operating under distinct laws. They acknowledge the existence of \"demonic faculty\"—powers acquired without corresponding moral evolution—and the rarity of the highest phases of consciousness. The author therefore suggests calling this new order of awareness \"universal or cosmic consciousness,\" contrasting it with individual bodily consciousness, and notes that this concept aligns with the Hindu philosophical aspiration for Sat-chit-ánanda Brahm—the unity of reality, knowing, and bliss.",

        "content": "The West seeks the individual consciousness—the157 enriched mind, ready perceptions and memories, individual hopes and fears, ambitions, loves, conquests—the self, the local self, in all its phases and forms—and sorely doubts whether such a thing as an universal consciousness exists. The East seeks the universal consciousness, and in those cases where its quest succeeds individual self and life thin away to a mere film, and are only the shadows cast by the glory revealed beyond. The individual consciousness takes the form of Thought, which is fluid and mobile like quicksilver, perpetually in a state of change and unrest, fraught with pain and effort; the other consciousness is not in the form of Thought. It touches, sees, hears, and is these things which it perceives—without motion, without change, without effort, without distinction of subject and object, but with a vast and incredible Joy. The individual consciousness is specially related to the body. The organs of the body are in some degree its organs. But the whole body is only as one organ of the cosmic consciousness. To attain this latter one must have the power of knowing one’s self separate from the body, of passing into a state of ecstasy in fact. Without this the cosmic consciousness cannot be experienced. It is said:—“There are four main experiences in initiation, (1) the meeting with a Guru, (2) the consciousness of Grace, or Arul (which may perhaps be interpreted as the consciousness of a change—even of a physiological change—working within one), (3) the vision of Siva (God), with which the knowledge of one’s self as distinct from the body is closely158 connected, (4) the finding of the universe within.” “The wise,” it is also said, “when their thoughts cease to move perceive within themselves the Absolute consciousness, which is Sarva sakshi, Witness of all things.” Great have been the disputes among the learned as to the meaning of the word Nirwana—whether it indicates a state of no-consciousness or a state of vastly enhanced consciousness. Probably both views have their justification: the thing does not admit of definition in the terms of ordinary language. The important thing to see and admit is that under cover of this and other similar terms there does exist a real and recognisable fact (that is a state of consciousness in some sense), which has been experienced over and over again, and which to those who have experienced it in ever so slight a degree has appeared worthy of lifelong pursuit and devotion. It is easy of course to represent the thing as a mere word, a theory, a speculation of the dreamy Hindu; but people do not sacrifice their lives for empty words, nor do mere philosophical abstractions rule the destinies of continents. No, the word represents a reality, something very basic and inevitable in human nature. The question really is not to define the fact—for we cannot do that—but to get at and experience it. It is interesting at this juncture to find that modern Western science, which has hitherto—without much result—been occupying itself with mechanical theories of the universe, is approaching from its side this idea of the existence of another form of consciousness. The extraordinary phenomena159 of hypnotism—which no doubt are in some degree related to the subject we are discussing, and which have been recognised for ages in the East—are forcing Western scientists to assume the existence of the so-called secondary consciousness in the body. The phenomena seem really inexplicable without the assumption of a secondary agency of some kind, and it every day becomes increasingly difficult not to use the word consciousness to describe it. Let it be understood that I am not for a moment assuming that this secondary consciousness of the hypnotists is in all respects identical with the cosmic consciousness (or whatever we may call it) of the Eastern occultists. It may or may not be. The two kinds of consciousness may cover the same ground, or they may only overlap to a small extent. That is a question I do not propose to discuss. The point to which I wish to draw attention is that Western science is envisaging the possibility of the existence in man of another consciousness of some kind, beside that with whose working we are familiar. It quotes (A. Moll) the case of Barkworth who “can add up long rows of figures while carrying on a lively discussion, without allowing his attention to be at all diverted from the discussion”; and asks us how Barkworth can do this unless he has a secondary consciousness which occupies itself with the figures while his primary consciousness is in the thick of argument. Here is a lecturer (F. Myers) who for a whole minute allows his mind to wander entirely away from the subject in hand, and imagines himself to be sitting beside a friend in the audience160 and to be engaged in conversation with him, and who wakes up to find himself still on the platform lecturing away with perfect ease and coherency. What are we to say to such a case as that? Here again is a pianist who recites a piece of music by heart, and finds that his recital is actually hindered by allowing his mind (his primary consciousness) to dwell upon what he is doing. It is sometimes suggested that the very perfection of the musical performance shows that it is mechanical or unconscious, but is this a fair inference? and would it not seem to be a mere contradiction in terms to speak of an unconscious lecture, or an unconscious addition of a row of figures?",
        "target_summary": "The excerpt contrasts the Western pursuit of individual consciousness—focused on the enriched mind, personal experiences, hopes, and ambitions, and doubting universal consciousness—with the Eastern quest for universal consciousness, which can diminish the individual self. Individual consciousness is depicted as fluid, mobile thought, full of change, unrest, pain, and effort, and intrinsically linked to the body's organs. In contrast, universal consciousness is beyond thought; it perceives and *is* what it perceives, operating without motion, change, effort, or distinction between subject and object, and is characterized by vast joy. It views the entire body as merely one organ.\n\nAttaining this universal state requires the ability to separate one's self from the body, achieving a state of ecstasy. This process is often marked by four initiation experiences: encountering a Guru, experiencing \"Grace\" or *Arul* (possibly a physiological change), having a vision of Siva (God) while recognizing one's self as distinct from the body, and discovering the universe within. It is believed that the wise perceive this Absolute consciousness (*Sarva sakshi*, the Witness of all things) when their thoughts cease.\n\nThe meaning of *Nirwana* is debated, interpreted variously as a state of no-consciousness or vastly enhanced consciousness, with the author suggesting both views might hold truth given its resistance to ordinary definition. Crucially, *Nirwana* is presented as a real, recognizable state of consciousness, repeatedly experienced and deemed worthy of lifelong devotion, not merely an empty word or philosophical abstraction. It represents a fundamental and inevitable aspect of human nature, best understood through direct experience rather than definition.\n\nIntriguingly, modern Western science, traditionally focused on mechanical explanations, is now beginning to approach the idea of other forms of consciousness. Phenomena like hypnotism are compelling scientists to posit a \"secondary consciousness\" in the body. Examples such as Barkworth simultaneously performing complex calculations and engaging in lively conversation, a lecturer continuing coherently while their mind wanders, or a pianist finding conscious thought hinders their performance, suggest a secondary agency at work. While the author does not claim this \"secondary consciousness\" is identical to the Eastern \"cosmic consciousness,\" its emergence in Western scientific thought signifies an increasing openness to the existence of other forms of awareness in humans beyond our familiar primary consciousness.",

        "content": "Many actions and processes of the body, e.g. swallowing, are attended by distinct personal consciousness; many other actions and processes are quite unperceived by the same; and it might seem reasonable to suppose that these latter at any rate were purely mechanical and devoid of any mental substratum. But the later developments of hypnotism in the West have shown—what is well known to the Indian fakirs—that under certain conditions consciousness of the internal actions and processes of the body can be obtained; and not only so, but consciousness of events taking place at a distance from the body and without the ordinary means of communication. Thus the idea of another consciousness, in some respects of wider range than the ordinary one, and having methods of perception of its own, has been gradually infiltrating itself into Western minds. There is another idea, which modern science has161 been familiarising us with, and which is bringing us towards the same conception—that namely of the fourth dimension. The supposition that the actual world has four space-dimensions instead of three makes many things conceivable which otherwise would be incredible. It makes it conceivable that apparently separate objects, e.g. distinct people, are really physically united; that things apparently sundered by enormous distances of space are really quite close together; that a person or other object might pass in and out of a closed room without disturbance of walls, doors, or windows, etc.; and if this fourth dimension were to become a factor of our consciousness it is obvious that we should have means of knowledge which to the ordinary sense would appear simply miraculous. There is much apparently to suggest that the consciousness attained to by the Indian gñánis in their degree, and by hypnotic subjects in theirs is of this fourth-dimensional order. As a solid is related to its own surfaces, so, it would appear, is the cosmic consciousness related to the ordinary consciousness. The phases of the personal consciousness are but different facets of the other consciousness; and experiences which seem remote from each other in the individual are perhaps all equally near in the universal. Space itself, as we know it, may be practically annihilated in the consciousness of a larger space of which it is but the superficies; and a person living in London may not unlikely find that he has a backdoor opening quite simply and unceremoniously out in Bombay. “The true quality of the soul,” said the Guru one162 day, “is that of space, by which it is at rest, everywhere. But this space (Akása) within the soul is far above the ordinary material space. The whole of the latter, including all the suns and stars, appears to you then as it were but an atom of the former”—and here he held up his fingers as though crumbling a speck of dust between them. “At rest everywhere,” “Indifference,” “Equality.” This was one of the most remarkable parts of the Guru’s teaching. Though (for family reasons) maintaining many of the observances of Caste himself, and though holding and teaching that for the mass of the people caste rules were quite necessary, he never ceased to insist that when the time came for a man (or woman) to be “emancipated” all these rules must drop aside as of no importance—all distinction of castes, classes, all sense of superiority or self-goodness—of right and wrong even—and the most absolute sense of Equality must prevail towards every one, and determination in its expression. Certainly it was remarkable (though I knew that the sacred books contained it) to find this germinal principle of Western democracy so vividly active and at work deep down beneath the innumerable layers of Oriental social life and custom. But so it is; and nothing shows better the relation between the West and the East than this fact. This sense of Equality, of Freedom from regulations and confinements, of Inclusiveness, and of the Life that “rests everywhere,” belongs of course more to the cosmic or universal part of man than to the individual part. To the latter it is always a stumbling-block and an offence. It is easy to show that men163 are not equal, that they cannot be free, and to point the absurdity of a life that is indifferent and at rest under all conditions. Nevertheless to the larger consciousness these are basic facts, which underlie the common life of humanity, and feed the very individual that denies them. Thus repeating the proviso that in using such terms as cosmic and universal consciousness we do not commit ourselves to the theory that the instant a man leaves the personal part of him he enters into absolutely unlimited and universal knowledge, but only into a higher order of perception—and admitting the intricacy and complexity of the region so roughly denoted by these terms, and the microscopical character of our knowledge about it—we may say once more, also as a roughest generalisation, that the quest of the East has been this universal consciousness, and that of the West the personal or individual consciousness. As is well known the East has its various sects and schools of philosophy, with subtle discriminations of qualities, essences, god-heads, devilhoods, etc., into which I do not propose to go, and which I should feel myself quite incompetent to deal with. Leaving all these aside, I will keep simply to these two rough Western terms, and try to consider further the question of the methods by which the Eastern student sets himself to obtain the cosmic state, or such higher order of consciousness as he does encompass.",
        "target_summary": "The excerpt explores the concept of expanded consciousness beyond ordinary perception. It notes that while some bodily functions are consciously perceived, others are not. However, both Western hypnotism and practices by Indian fakirs demonstrate that individuals can gain awareness of internal bodily processes and even distant events without conventional means. This suggests a \"wider consciousness\" with its own methods of perception, a concept gradually entering Western thought.\n\nThis idea is paralleled by the scientific concept of a \"fourth dimension,\" which posits that the world has four spatial dimensions. This makes seemingly impossible phenomena conceivable, such as apparently separate objects being physically united, vast distances becoming negligible, or objects passing through solid barriers. If this fourth-dimensional consciousness were accessible, it would grant extraordinary knowledge, which the author links to the experiences of Indian gñánis and hypnotic subjects. In this \"cosmic consciousness,\" personal experiences are facets of a universal whole, and conventional space can be transcended, allowing for immediate connection between distant locations.\n\nA Guru's teachings further elaborate on these ideas, describing the soul's true nature as a superior \"space\" (Akása) that encompasses the entire material universe as a mere atom. He also emphasized \"Equality,\" \"Indifference,\" and \"Rest everywhere.\" Crucially, he taught that while societal rules like caste are necessary for the general populace, an \"emancipated\" individual must shed all distinctions—of caste, class, superiority, and even conventional right and wrong—to embrace absolute equality. The author highlights this \"germinal principle of Western democracy\" found deep within Eastern thought as a significant East-West connection.\n\nThis profound sense of Equality, freedom, and universal connection emanates from humanity's cosmic or universal aspect, often conflicting with the individual self. Despite individual resistance, these are fundamental truths for the larger consciousness. The author clarifies that \"cosmic consciousness\" implies a *higher order of perception*, not immediate unlimited knowledge, acknowledging the complexity of this domain. Broadly, the East has pursued this universal consciousness, while the West has focused on individual consciousness. The text intends to further examine Eastern methods for attaining this higher state, using Western terminology and avoiding intricate philosophical details.",

        "title": "METHODS OF ATTAINMENT",
        "content": "The subject of the methods used by the yogis for the attainment of another order of consciousness has its physical, its mental, and its moral sides—and doubtless other sides as well. Beginning with the physical side, it is probable that the discounting or repression of the physical brain—or of that part of it which is the seat of the primary consciousness—is the most important: on the theory that the repression of the primary consciousness opens the way for the manifestation of any other consciousness that may be present. Thus hypnotism lulls or fatigues the ordinary brain into a complete torpor—so allowing the phenomena connected with the secondary consciousness to come out into the greater prominence. It need not be supposed that hypnotism induces the secondary consciousness, but only that it removes that other consciousness which ordinarily conceals or hinders its expression. Some of the methods adopted by the yogis are undoubtedly of this hypnotic character, such as the sitting or standing for long periods absolutely fixed in one position; staring at the sun or other object; repeating a word or phrase over and over again for thousands of times, etc.; and the clairvoyant and other results produced seem in many165 respects very similar to the results of Western hypnotism. The yogi however by immense persistence in his practices, and by using his own will to effect the change of consciousness, instead of surrendering himself into the power of another person, seems to be able to transfer his “I” or ego into the new region, and to remember on his return to ordinary consciousness what he has seen there; whereas the hypnotic subject seems to be divided into a double ego, and as a rule remembers nothing in the primary state of what occurred to him in the secondary. Others of the yogis adopt prolonged fasting, abstinence from sleep, self-torture and emaciation, with the same object, namely the reduction of the body, and apparently with somewhat similar results—though in these cases not only insight is supposed to be gained, but added powers over nature, arising from the intense forces of control put forth and educed by these exercises. The fact that the Siddhi or miraculous powers can be gained in this way is so universally accepted and taken for granted in India that (even after making all allowances) it is difficult not to be carried away on the stream of belief. And indeed when one considers the known powers of the will—cultivated as it is to but a feeble degree amongst most of us—there seems to be an inherent probability in the case. The adepts however as a rule, though entirely agreeing that the attainment of the Siddhi powers is possible, strongly condemn the quest of them by these methods—saying with great justice that the mere fact of a quest of this kind is a breach of the law of Indifference and166 Trust, and that the quest being instigated by some desire—ambition, spiritual pride, love of gain, or what not—necessarily ends either by stultifying itself, or by feeding the desire, and, if some powers are gained, by the devotion of them to evil ends. Thus the methods that are mainly physical produce certain results—clairvoyances and controls—which are largely physical in their character, and are probably for the most part more or less morbid and dangerous. They are however very widely spread among the inferior classes of yogis all over India, and the performances which spring from them, by exciting the fear and wonder of the populace, often become—as in the case of mesmeric performances in the West—a source of considerable gain to the chief actor. There remain two other classes of methods—the mental and the moral. Of the mental no doubt the most important is the Suppression of Thought—and it is not unlikely that this may have, when once understood, a far-reaching and important influence on our Western life—over-ridden and dominated as it is by a fever of Thought which it can by no means control. Nothing indeed strikes one more as marking the immense contrast between the East and the West than, after leaving Western lands where the ideal of life is to have an almost insanely active brain and to be perpetually on the war-path with fearful and wonderful projects and plans and purposes, to come to India and to find its leading men—men of culture and learning and accomplishment—deliberately passing beyond all these and addressing themselves167 to the task of effacing their own thoughts, effacing all their own projects and purposes, in order that the diviner consciousness may enter in and occupy the room so prepared. The effacement of projects and purposes—which comes to much the same thing as the control of desire—belongs more properly to the moral side of the question, and may be considered later on. The subjection of Thought—which obviously is very closely connected with the subjection of Desire—may however be considered here. The Gñana-yogis (so called, to distinguish them from the Karma-yogis who rely more upon the external and physical methods) adopt two practices, (1) that of intense concentration of the thoughts on a fixed object, (2) that of the effacement of thought altogether. (1) The thoughts may be fixed on a definite object, for instance, on one’s own breathing—the inflow and outflow of the atmosphere through the channels of the physical body. The body must be kept perfectly still and motionless for a long period—so that it may pass entirely out of consciousness—and the thoughts fixed on the regulated calm tide of respiration, to the complete exclusion of every other subject. Or the name of an object—a flower for instance—may be repeated incessantly—the image of the object being called up at the same time—till at last the name and the image of the object blend and become indistinguishable in the mind. Such practices have their literal and their spiritual sides. If carried out merely as formulæ, they evidently partake of a mesmeric (self-mesmeric)168 character, and ultimately induce mesmeric states of consciousness.4 If carried out with a strong sense of their inner meaning—the presence of the vast cosmic life in the breathing, the endeavor to realise Brahma himself in the flower or other object contemplated—they naturally induce a deeper sense of the universal life and consciousness than that which belongs to the mesmeric state. Anyhow they teach a certain power and control over the thoughts; and it is a doctrine much insisted on by the Gurus that in life generally the habit of the undivided concentration of the mind on that which one is doing is of the utmost importance. The wandering of the mind, its division and distraction, its openness to attack by brigand cares and anxieties, its incapacity to heartily enjoy itself in its work, not only lame and cripple and torment it in every way, but are a mark of the want of that faith which believes in the Now as the divine moment, and takes no thought for the Morrow. To concentrate at all times wholly and unreservedly in what you are doing at the moment is, they say, a distinct step in Gñánam.",
        "target_summary": "Yogic methods for achieving altered states of consciousness encompass physical, mental, and moral dimensions. The physical approach aims to repress primary brain consciousness to allow other forms of awareness to manifest, similar to how hypnotism removes ordinary consciousness to reveal secondary states. Yogis utilize hypnotic-like techniques such as holding fixed postures for long periods, staring at objects, or repeating words thousands of times, yielding results like clairvoyance comparable to Western hypnotism. However, yogis differ by using their own will to induce the change, transferring their ego, and remembering their experiences upon returning to normal consciousness. Other physical methods include prolonged fasting, sleep deprivation, self-torture, and emaciation, intended to reduce the body. These practices are believed to grant not only insight but also \"Siddhi\" or miraculous powers over nature, a belief widely accepted in India. Despite this, advanced yogis (adepts) strongly advise against seeking Siddhi through such methods, deeming it a breach of \"Indifference and Trust,\" driven by desire, which can lead to negative outcomes or misuse of powers. Consequently, these largely physical methods are often considered morbid and dangerous, predominantly practiced by lower-class yogis for financial gain.\n\nThe mental methods, particularly the Suppression of Thought, contrast sharply with the Western emphasis on an incessantly active mind. In India, influential thinkers deliberately efface their thoughts and intentions to facilitate the emergence of a \"diviner consciousness.\" Gñana-yogis practice two key techniques: intense concentration on a fixed object and the complete effacement of thought. Concentration involves focusing on something like one's breathing while keeping the body still, or incessantly repeating an object's name until its image and name merge mentally. These practices can be self-mesmeric, inducing altered states, or, when imbued with spiritual meaning (e.g., realizing cosmic life), can lead to a deeper sense of universal consciousness. Gurus stress the importance of cultivating undivided concentration in daily life for thought control, preventing distraction, and embracing the present moment (\"Now\"), which is considered a vital step in Gñánam.",

        "content": "The next step, the effacement of Thought, is a much more difficult one. Only when the power of concentration has been gained can this be attempted with any prospect of success. The body must be kept, as before, perfectly motionless, and in a quiet169 place free from disturbance; not in an attitude of ease or slumber, but sitting or standing erect with muscles tense. All will-power is required, and the greatest vigilance. Every thought must be destroyed on the instant of its appearance. But the enemy is subtle, and failure—over a long period—inevitable. Then when success seems to be coming and Thought is dwindling, Oblivion, the twin-foe, appears and must also be conquered. For if Thought merely give place to Sleep, what is there gained? After months, but more probably years, of intermittent practice the power of control grows; curious but distinct physiological changes take place; one day the student finds that Thought has gone; he stands for a moment in Oblivion; then that veil lifts, and there streams through his being a vast and illumined consciousness, glorious, that fills and overflows him, “surrounding him so that he is like a pot in water, which has the liquid within it and without.” In this consciousness there is divine knowledge but no thought. It is Samádhi, the universal “I Am.” Whatever people may think of the reality of this “Samádhi,” of the genuineness or the universality of the consciousness obtained in it, etc. (and these are questions which of course require examination), it is incontestable that for centuries and centuries it has been an object of the most strenuous endeavor to vast numbers even of the very acutest and most capable intellects of India. Earthly joys paled before this ecstasy; the sacred literatures are full of its praise. That there lurks here some definite and important fact of experience is I think obvious—though it is quite probable that it is not yet really170 understood, either by the East that discovered it or the West that has criticised it. Leaving however for the present the consideration of this ultimate and transcendent result of the effacement of Thought, and freely admitting that the Eastern devotees have in the ardor of their pursuit of it been often led into mere absurdities and excesses—that they have in some cases practically mutilated their thinking powers—that they have refrained from speech for such prolonged years that at last not only the tongue but the brain itself refused to act—that they have in instances reduced themselves to the condition of idiots and babbling children, and rendered themselves incapable of carrying on any kind of work ordinarily called useful—admitting all this, it still remains true I think that even in its lower aspects this doctrine is of vast import to-day in the West. For we moderns, while we have dominated Nature and external results in the most extraordinary way through our mechanical and other sciences, have just neglected this other field of mastery over our own internal mechanism. We pride ourselves on our athletic feats, but some of the performances of the Indian fakirs in the way of mastery over the internal processes of the body—processes which in ordinary cases have long ago lapsed into the region of the involuntary and unconscious—such as holding the breath over enormous periods, or reversing the peristaltic action of the alimentary canal throughout its entire length—are so astonishing that for the most part the report of them only excites incredulity among us, and we can hardly believe—what I take it171 is a fact—that these physiological powers have been practised till they are almost reduced to a science. And if we are unwilling to believe in this internal mastery over the body, we are perhaps almost equally unaccustomed to the idea of mastery over our own inner thoughts and feelings. That a man should be a prey to any thought that chances to take possession of his mind is commonly among us assumed as unavoidable. It may be a matter of regret that he should be kept awake all night from anxiety as to the issue of a lawsuit on the morrow, but that he should have the power of determining whether he be kept awake or not seems an extravagant demand. The image of an impending calamity is no doubt odious, but its very odiousness (we say) makes it haunt the mind all the more pertinaciously—and it is useless to try to expel it. Yet this is an absurd position—for man, the heir of all the ages, to be in: hag-ridden by the flimsy creatures of his own brain. If a pebble in our boot torments us we expel it. We take off the boot and shake it out. And once the matter is fairly understood it is just as easy to expel an intruding and obnoxious thought from the mind. About this there ought to be no mistake, no two opinions. The thing is obvious, clear, and unmistakable. It should be as easy to expel an obnoxious thought from your mind as to shake a stone out of your shoe; and till a man can do that, it is just nonsense to talk about his ascendancy over Nature, and all the rest of it. He is a mere slave, and a prey to the bat-winged phantoms that flit through the corridors of his own brain. 172 Yet the weary and careworn faces that we meet by thousands, even among the affluent classes of civilisation, testify only too clearly how seldom this mastery is obtained. How rare indeed to meet a man! How common rather to discover a creature hounded on by tyrant thoughts (or cares or desires), cowering wincing under the lash—or perchance priding himself to run merrily in obedience to a driver that rattles the reins and persuades him that he is free—whom we cannot converse with in careless tête-à-tête because that alien presence is always there, on the watch. It is one of the most prominent doctrines of the Gñánis that the power of expelling thoughts, or if need be of killing them dead on the spot, must be attained. Naturally the art requires practice; but like other arts, when once acquired there is no more mystery or difficulty about it. And it is worth practice. It may indeed fairly be said that life only begins when this art has been acquired. For obviously when instead of being ruled by individual thoughts, the whole flock of them in their immense multitude and variety and capacity is ours to direct and despatch and employ where we list (“for He maketh the winds his messengers and the flaming fire his minister”), life becomes a thing so vast and grand compared with what it was before that its former condition may well appear almost antenatal.",
        "target_summary": "The effacement of Thought, a much more challenging endeavor, requires intense concentration, a perfectly still body in a quiet place (not for ease but with tense muscles), and immense willpower and vigilance. Every thought must be instantly destroyed, a process where initial failure is inevitable. Once thought dwindles, \"Oblivion\" (sleep) emerges as a twin-foe that must also be conquered, as merely falling asleep achieves nothing. After months or years of intermittent practice, control grows, leading to distinct physiological changes. Eventually, thoughts vanish, followed by a moment of Oblivion, which then lifts to reveal a vast, \"illumined consciousness\"—Samádhi. This state is characterized by glorious, divine knowledge without thought, described as the universal \"I Am,\" permeating and overflowing the practitioner.\n\nRegardless of debates about Samádhi's reality, it has been the object of strenuous pursuit for centuries by India's sharpest intellects, with earthly joys paling in comparison to its ecstasy and sacred texts praising it extensively. This suggests it represents a profound, definite fact of experience, even if not fully understood by East or West.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Eastern devotees, in their ardent pursuit, sometimes went to extremes—mutilating thinking powers, rendering themselves incapable of speech or useful work, and even reducing themselves to an idiotic state—the author argues that even the \"lower aspects\" of this doctrine hold vast import for the West today. Modern Westerners have spectacularly mastered external nature through science but have neglected mastery over their own internal mechanisms. The incredible feats of Indian fakirs, such as prolonged breath-holding or reversing peristaltic action—mastery over processes usually involuntary—are often met with disbelief in the West, yet these physiological powers are practically a science to them.\n\nSimilarly, Western society is largely unaccustomed to the idea of mastering inner thoughts and feelings, often assuming it's unavoidable to be \"prey to any thought.\" For instance, being kept awake by anxiety is accepted, but the power to *choose* not to be anxious is seen as an extravagant demand. The author calls this an \"absurd position\" for humanity to be \"hag-ridden by the flimsy creatures of its own brain.\" He contends that just as one expels a tormenting pebble from a shoe, one should be able to expel an intruding and obnoxious thought from the mind. Failure to do so renders any talk of \"ascendancy over Nature\" meaningless, reducing a person to a mere slave to their own thoughts.\n\nThe widespread \"weary and careworn faces\" in society attest to how rarely this internal mastery is achieved. The Gñánis teach that the power to expel or \"kill\" thoughts is essential. This art, like others, requires practice but becomes effortless once acquired. The author concludes that \"life only begins when this art has been acquired,\" as directing and employing one's thoughts at will transforms existence into something \"vast and grand\" compared to the prior state of being ruled by them.",

And it not only frees a man from mental torment (which is nine-tenths at least of the torment of life),173 but it gives him a concentred power of handling mental work absolutely unknown to him before. The two things are correlative to each other. As already said this is one of the principles of Gñánam. While at work your thought is to be absolutely concentrated in it, undistracted by anything whatever irrelevant to the matter in hand—pounding away like a great engine, with giant power and perfect economy—no wear and tear of friction, or dislocation of parts owing to the working of different forces at the same time. Then when the work is finished, if there is no more occasion for the use of the machine, it must stop equally absolutely—stop entirely—no worrying (as if a parcel of boys were allowed to play their devilments with a locomotive as soon as it was in the shed)—and the man must retire into that region of his consciousness where his true self dwells. I say the power of the thought-machine itself is enormously increased by this faculty of letting it alone on the one hand and of using it singly and with concentration on the other. It becomes a true tool, which a master-workman lays down when done with, but which only a bungler carries about with him all the time to show that he is the possessor of it. Then on and beyond the work turned out by the tool itself is the knowledge that comes to us apart from its use: when the noise of the workshop is over, and mallet and plane laid aside—the faint sounds coming through the open window from the valley and the far seashore: the dim fringe of diviner knowledge, which begins to grow, poor174 thing, as soon as the eternal click-clack of thought is over—the extraordinary intuitions, perceptions, which, though partaking in some degree of the character of thought, spring from entirely different conditions, and are the forerunners of a changed consciousness. At first they appear miraculous, but it is not so. They are not miraculous, for they are always there. (The stars are always there.) It is we who are miraculous in our inattention to them. In the systemic or secondary or cosmic consciousness of man (I daresay all these ought to be distinguished, but I lump them together for the present) lurk the most minute and varied and far-reaching intuitions and perceptions—some of them in their swiftness and subtlety outreaching even those of the primary consciousness—but to them we do not attend because Thought like a pied piper is ever capering and fiddling in front of us. And when Thought is gone, lo! we are asleep. To open your eyes in that region which is neither Night nor Day is to behold strange and wonderful things.",
        "target_summary": "The ability to consciously halt one's thoughts at will is immensely valuable. This power liberates individuals from most mental torment and concurrently grants an unparalleled capacity for focused mental work, as these benefits are deeply intertwined. During a task, thought must be absolutely concentrated, functioning like a powerful, efficient engine free from any irrelevant distractions or internal friction. Once the work concludes, this \"thought-machine\" must cease entirely, preventing idle worrying and allowing the individual to retreat into their true self. This dual faculty—of intensely focused use and complete cessation—significantly enhances the thought-machine's power, making it a true tool that a master workman employs and then lays aside, rather than a constant burden.\n\nBeyond the output of this mental tool, a profound \"diviner knowledge\" emerges when the incessant \"click-clack\" of thought subsides. This manifests as extraordinary intuitions and perceptions, distinct from ordinary thought, that arise from different conditions and foreshadow a changed consciousness. These insights are not miraculous; they are always present, but our inattention makes them appear so. Within humanity's deeper, \"cosmic consciousness,\" lie minute, varied, and far-reaching intuitions and perceptions, some even swifter and subtler than those of primary consciousness. However, we typically fail to attend to them because thought, like a pied piper, constantly distracts us, and when it stops, we often remain \"asleep\" to these deeper realities.

        "content": "As already said the subjection of Thought is closely related to the subjection of Desire, and has consequently its specially moral as well as its specially intellectual relation to the question in hand. Nine-tenths of the scattered or sporadic thought with which the mind usually occupies itself when not concentrated on any definite work is what may be called self-thought—thought of a kind which dwells on and exaggerates the sense of self. This is hardly realised in its full degree till the effort is made to175 suppress it; and one of the most excellent results of such an effort is that with the stilling of all the phantoms which hover round the lower self, one’s relations to others, to one’s friends, to the world at large, and one’s perception of all that is concerned in these relations come out into a purity and distinctness unknown before. Obviously while the mind is full of the little desires and fears which concern the local self, and is clouded over by the thought-images which such desires and fears evoke, it is impossible that it should see and understand the greater facts beyond and its own relation to them. But with the subsiding of the former the great Vision begins to dawn; and a man never feels less alone than when he has ceased to think whether he is alone or not. It is in this respect that the subjection of desire is really important. There is no necessity to suppose that desire, in itself, is an evil; indeed it is quite conceivable that it may fall into place as a useful and important element of human nature—though certainly one whose importance will be found to dwindle and gradually disappear as time goes on. The trouble for us is, in our present state, that desire is liable to grow to such dimensions as to overcloud the world for us, emprison, and shut us out from inestimable Freedom beneath its sway. Under such circumstances it evidently is a nuisance and has to be dominated. No doubt certain sections of the Indian and other ascetic philosophies have taught the absolute extinction of desire, but we may fairly regard these as cases—so common in the history of all traditional teaching—of undue176 prominence given to a special detail, and of the exaltation of the letter of the doctrine above the spirit. The moral element (at which we have now arrived) in the attainment of a higher order of consciousness is of course recognised by all the great Indian teachers as of the first importance. The sacred books, the sermons of Buddha, the discourses of the present-day Gurus, all point in the same direction. Gentleness, forbearance towards all, abstention from giving pain, especially to the animals, the recognition of the divine spirit in every creature down to the lowest, the most absolute sense of equality and the most absolute candor, an undisturbed serene mind, free from anger, fear, or any excessive and tormenting desire—these are all insisted on. Thus, though physical and mental conditions are held—and rightly—to be important, the moral conditions are held to be at least equally important. Nevertheless, in order to guard against misconception which in so complex a subject may easily arise, it is necessary to state here—what I have hinted before—that different sections and schools among the devotees place a very different respective value upon the three sets of conditions—some making more of the physical, others of the mental, and others again of the moral—and that as may be easily guessed the results attained by the various schools differ considerably in consequence. The higher esoteric teachers naturally lay the greatest stress on the moral, but any account of their methods would be defective which passed over or blinked the fact that they go beyond the moral—because177 this fact is in some sense of the essence of the Oriental inner teaching. Morality, it is well understood, involves the conception of one’s self as distinct from others, as distinct from the world, and presupposes a certain antagonism between one’s own interests and those of one’s fellows. One “sacrifices” one’s own interests to those of another, or “goes out of one’s way” to help him. All such ideas must be entirely left behind, if one is to reach the central illumination. They spring from ignorance and are the products of darkness. On no word did the “Grammarian” insist more strongly than on the word Non-differentiation. You are not even to differentiate yourself in thought from others; you are not to begin to regard yourself as separate from them. Even to talk about helping others is a mistake; it is vitiated by the delusion that you and they are twain. So closely does the subtle Hindu mind go to the mark! What would our bald commercial philanthropy, our sleek æsthetic altruism, our scientific isophily, say to such teaching? All the little self-satisfactions which arise from the sense of duty performed, all the cheese-parings of equity between oneself and others, all the tiny wonderments whether you are better or worse than your neighbor, have to be abandoned; and you have to learn to live in a world in which the chief fact is not that you are distinct from others, but that you are a part of and integral with them. This involves indeed a return to the communal order of society, and difficult as this teaching is for us in this day to realise, yet there is no doubt that it must lie at the heart of the Democracy of the future, as it has lain, germinal, 178 all these centuries in the hidden womb of the East. Nor from Nature. You are not to differentiate yourself from Nature. We have seen that the Guru Tilleináthan spoke of the operations of the external world as “I,” having dismissed the sense of difference between himself and them. It is only under these, and such conditions as these, that the little mortal creature gradually becomes aware of What he is.",
        "target_summary": "The author asserts that subduing thought is closely tied to controlling desire, bearing both moral and intellectual significance. The majority of our unfocused thought is \"self-thought,\" which exaggerates the ego. Suppressing this self-preoccupation clarifies one's relationships with others and the world, revealing a distinct purity of perception. While the mind is clouded by self-centered desires and fears, it cannot grasp greater truths; their subsiding allows \"the great Vision\" to dawn.\n\nDesire, though not intrinsically evil, currently tends to overwhelm perception and restrict freedom, necessitating its domination. While some ascetic philosophies advocate its total extinction, this may be an overemphasis on a detail. Indian teachers, including Buddha and Gurus, consistently emphasize the moral element as crucial for higher consciousness. This includes virtues like gentleness, forbearance, non-harming (especially animals), recognizing the divine in all beings, absolute equality, candor, and a serene mind free from anger, fear, or excessive desire.\n\nHowever, while moral conditions are vital, higher esoteric teachings ultimately transcend conventional morality. Morality, by definition, involves conceiving of oneself as distinct from others, implying antagonism or sacrifice. To achieve \"central illumination,\" these ideas must be abandoned, as they stem from ignorance. The core principle is \"Non-differentiation\": one must not even think of oneself as separate from others, or from nature. Concepts like \"helping others\" are flawed if they presuppose a separation between individuals. One must relinquish self-satisfaction derived from duty or comparisons and learn to live as an integral part of the whole. This holistic perspective is seen as essential for a future communal society and for an individual to become truly aware of their nature.",

        "content": "This non-differentiation is the final deliverance. When it enters in the whole burden of absurd cares, anxieties, duties, motives, desires, fears, plans, purposes, preferences, etc., rolls off and lies like mere lumber on the ground. The winged spirit is free, and takes its flight. It passes through the veil of mortality and leaves that behind. Though I say this non-differentiation is the final deliverance (from the bonds of illusion) I do not say it is the final experience. Rather I should be inclined to think it is only the beginning of many experiences. As, in the history of man and the higher animals, the consciousness of self—the local self—has been the basis of an enormous mass of perceptions, intuitions, joys, sufferings, etc., incalculable and indescribable in multitudinousness and variety, so in the history of man and the angels will the consciousness of the cosmic and universal life—the true self underlying—become the basis of another and far vaster knowledge. There is one respect in which the specially Eastern teaching commonly appears to us Westerners—and on the whole I am inclined to think justly—defective;179 and that is in its little insistence on the idea of Love. While, as already said, a certain gentleness and forbearance and passive charity is a decided feature of Indian teaching and life, one cannot help noting the absence—or less prominence at any rate—of that positive spirit of love and human helpfulness which in some sections of Western society might almost be called a devouring passion. Though with plentiful exceptions no doubt, yet there is a certain quiescence and self-inclusion and absorbedness in the Hindu ideal, which amounts almost to coldness; and this is the more curious because Hindu society—till within the last few years at any rate—has been based upon the most absolutely communal foundation. But perhaps this fact of the communal structure of society in India is just the reason why the social sentiment does not seek impetuously for expression there; while in Europe, where existing institutions are a perpetual denial of it, its expression becomes all the more determined and necessary. However that may be, I think the fact may be admitted of a difference between the East and the West in this respect. Of course I am not speaking of those few who may attain to the consciousness of non-differentiation—because in their case the word love must necessarily change its meaning; nor am I speaking of the specially individual and sexual and amatory love, in which there is no reason to suppose the Hindus deficient; but I am rather alluding to the fact that in the West we are in the habit of looking on devotion to other humans (widening out into the social passion) as the most natural way of losing one’s self-limitations and180 passing into a larger sphere of life and consciousness; while in the East this method is little thought of or largely neglected, in favor of the concentration of one’s self in the divine, and mergence in the universal in that way. I think this contrast—taking it quite roughly—may certainly be said to exist. The Indian teachers, the sacred books, the existing instruction, centre consciously or unconsciously round the development of Will-power. By will to surrender the will; by determination and concentration to press inward and upward to that portion of one’s being which belongs to the universal, to conquer the body, to conquer the thoughts, to conquer the passions and emotions; always will, and will-power. And here again we have a paradox, because in their quiescent, gentle, and rather passive external life—so different from the push and dominating energy of the Western nations—there is little to make one expect such force. But while modern Europe and America has spent its Will in the mastery of the external world, India has reserved hers for the conquest of inner and spiritual kingdoms. In their hypnotic phenomena too, the yogis exhibit the force of will, and this differentiates their hypnotism from that of the West—in which the patient is operated upon by another person. In the latter there is a danger of loss of will-power, but in the former (auto-hypnotism) will-power is no doubt gained, while at the same time hypnotic states are induced. Suggestion, which is such a powerful agent in hypnotism, acts here too, and helps to knit the body together, pervading it with a healing influence, and bringing the lower self181 under the direct domination of the higher; and in this respect the Guru to some extent stands in the place of the operator, while the yogi is his subject. Thus in the East the Will constitutes the great path; but in the West the path has been more specially through Love—and probably will be. The great teachers of the West—Plato, Jesus, Paul—have indicated this method rather than that of the ascetic will; though of course there have not been wanting exponents of both sides. The one method means the gradual dwindling of the local and external self through inner concentration and aspiration, the other means the enlargement of the said self through affectional growth and nourishment, till at last it can contain itself no longer. The bursting of the sac takes place; the life is poured out, and ceasing to be local becomes universal. Of this method Whitman forms a signal instance. He is egotistic enough in all conscience; yet at last through his immense human sympathy, and through the very enlargement of his ego thus taking place, the barriers break down and he passes out and away. But such expressions as these—in which the passion of humanity wraps the speaker into another sphere of existence—are not characteristic of the East, and are not found in the Indian scriptures. When its time comes the West will probably adopt this method of the liberation of the human soul—through love—rather than the specially Indian method—of the Will; though doubtless both have to be, and will be in the future, to a large extent concurrently used. Different races and peoples incline according to their idiosyncrasies to different ways; each individual even—as is quite recognised by the present-day Gurus—has his special line of approach to the supreme facts. It is possible that when the Western races once realise what lies beneath this great instinct of humanity, which seems in some ways to be their special inspiration, they will outstrip even the Hindus in their entrance to and occupation of the new fields of consciousness.",
        "target_summary": "Non-differentiation is presented as a profound, liberating state that sheds mundane anxieties and frees the spirit. While it's the \"final deliverance\" from illusion, it is considered only the *beginning* of many experiences. Just as self-consciousness formed the basis for vast human perceptions and sufferings, the consciousness of the cosmic and universal life – the true self – will become the foundation for an even vaster knowledge.\n\nHowever, the author notes a perceived deficiency in Eastern (specifically Indian) teachings when viewed from a Western perspective: a lesser emphasis on \"Love.\" While a certain gentleness, forbearance, and passive charity are evident in Indian life, there's a noticeable absence of the active, positive spirit of love and human helpfulness that can become a \"devouring passion\" in some Western societies. This might stem from India's historically communal social structure, which perhaps lessens the impetuous need for explicit social sentiment, in contrast to Europe where institutions often deny it, making its expression more determined. This critique isn't directed at those who achieve non-differentiation (where love's meaning transforms) or individual/sexual affection. Instead, it highlights the Western tendency to view devotion to other humans, expanding into a social passion, as a natural path to transcend self-limitations and enter a broader consciousness—a method largely neglected in the East, which favors self-concentration on the divine and merging with the universal.\n\nThe Indian approach, reflected in teachers and scriptures, consciously or unconsciously centers on developing \"Will-power.\" This involves using will to surrender will, employing determination and concentration to reach the universal part of one's being, and conquering the body, thoughts, and emotions. This focus on internal will is paradoxical given the outwardly quiescent Eastern life, which contrasts with the West's energetic drive. While modern Europe and America have directed their Will towards mastering the external world, India has reserved hers for conquering inner, spiritual kingdoms. Yogis' self-hypnosis further illustrates this by demonstrating gained will-power to induce healing states, differing from Western hypnotism where a patient is acted upon by another. Here, the Guru can also act in place of the operator, guiding the yogi.\n\nThus, \"Will\" constitutes the great path in the East, while \"Love\" has been, and likely will remain, the predominant path in the West. Prominent Western teachers like Plato, Jesus, and Paul have advocated this method over ascetic will. The Will-based method involves the gradual dwindling of the local self through inner focus. Conversely, the Love-based method entails the expansion of the self through affectional growth, eventually leading to its dissolution and a universal life, exemplified by Walt Whitman's immense human sympathy. Such expressions of enveloping humanity are uncommon in Eastern scriptures. The author suggests that when the West fully grasps this powerful instinct of humanity, it may adopt this love-driven liberation, potentially surpassing even the Hindus. Ultimately, both methods—Will and Love—are crucial and will likely be used concurrently in the future, as different individuals and cultures naturally gravitate towards distinct paths to supreme realization.",

From the question whether Jesus and Paul were initiates in the Eastern mysteries—as the modern Gurus claim that they were, and as I think there can be no184 doubt that they were, either by tradition or by spontaneous evolution; through the question of the similarity and differences of their teaching; the various schools of early Christianity; the Egyptian influences; the Gnostic sects and philosophy; the formation and history of the Church, its organisations, creeds and doctrines; mediæval Christianity and its relation to Aristotle; the mystic teachers of the 13th and 14th centuries; the ascetic and monastic movements; the belief in alchemy and witchcraft; the miracles of the Saints; the Protestant movement and doctrines, etc., etc.; down to the innumerable petty sects of to-day and all their conflicting views on the atonement and the sacraments and the inspiration of the Bible, and all the rest of it—who would be so bold as to announce the gist and resume of it all in a few brief sentences? Yet the great Indian evolution of religious thought—while historically more ancient—is at least equally vast and complex and bewildering in its innumerable ramifications. I should feel entirely incompetent to deal with it as a whole—and here at any rate am only touching upon the personality and utterances of one teacher, belonging to a particular school, the South Indian. This Guru was, as I have said, naturally one of those who insisted largely—though not by any means exclusively—on the moral and ultra-moral sides of the teaching; and from this point of view his personality was particularly remarkable. His gentleness and kindliness, combined with evident power; and inflexibility and intensity underlying; his tense eyes, as of the seer, and gracious lips and185 expression, and ease and dignity of figure; his entire serenity and calm—though with lots of vigor when needed; all these were impressive. But perhaps I was most struck—as the culmination of character and manhood—by his perfect simplicity of manner. Nothing could be more unembarrassed, unselfconscious, direct to the point in hand, free from kinks of any kind. Sometimes he would sit on his sofa couch in the little cottage, not unfrequently, as I have said, with bare feet gathered beneath him; sometimes he would sit on a chair at the table; sometimes in the animation of discourse his muslin wrap would fall from his shoulder, unnoticed, showing a still graceful figure, thin, but by no means emaciated; sometimes he would stand for a moment, a tall and dignified form; yet always with the same ease and grace and absence of self-consciousness that only the animals and a few among human beings show. It was this that made him seem very near to one, as if the ordinary barriers which divide people were done away with; and if this was non-differentiation working within, its external effect was very admirable. I dwell perhaps the more on these points of character, which made me feel an extraordinary rapprochement and unspoken intimacy to this man, because I almost immediately found on acquaintance that on the plane of ordinary thought and scientific belief we were ever so far asunder, with only a small prospect, owing to difficulties of language, etc., of ever coming to an understanding. I found—though this of course gave a special interest to his conversation—that his views of astronomy, physiology, 186 chemistry, politics and the rest, were entirely unmodified by Western thought and science—and that they had come down through a long line of oral tradition, continually reinforced by references to the sacred books, from a most remote antiquity. Here was a man who living in a native principality under an Indian rajah, and skilled in the learning of his own country, had probably come across very few English at all till he was of mature years, had not learned the English language, and had apparently troubled himself but little about Western ideas of any kind. I am not a stickler for modern science myself, and think many of its conclusions very shaky; but I confess it gave me a queer feeling when I found a man of so subtle intelligence and varied capacity calmly asserting that the earth was the centre of the physical universe and that the sun revolved about it! With all seriousness he turned out the theory (which old Lactantius Indicopleustes introduced from the East into Europe about the 3rd century A.D.)—namely that the earth is flat, with a great hill, the celebrated Mount Meru, in the north, behind which the sun and moon and other heavenly bodies retire in their order to rest. He explained that an eclipse of the moon (then going on) was caused by one of the two “dark planets,” Ráku or Kétu (which are familiar to astrology), concealing it from view. He said (and this is also an ancient doctrine) that there were 1, 008 solar or planetary systems similar to ours, some above the earth, some below, and some on either hand. As to the earth itself it had been destroyed and recreated many times in successive æons, but there187 had never been a time when the divine knowledge had not existed on it. There had always been an India (gñána bhumi, or Wisdom-land, in contradistinction to the Western bhoga bhumi, or land of pleasure), and always Vedas or Upanishads (or books corresponding) brought by divine teachers. (About modern theories of submerged continents and lower races in the far past he did not appear to know anything or to have troubled his head, nor did he put forth any views on this subject of the kind mentioned by Sinnett in his Esoteric Buddhism. Many of his views however were very similar to those given in that book.)",
        "target_summary": "The author shifts focus from general spiritual experiences to the formal teachings of a specific South Indian Guru, aiming to highlight the unique character of Eastern thought and its differences from modern Western thinking. He cautions against accepting any statement without reserve or generalizing from specific details, illustrating the vast complexity of Indian religious thought by comparing it to the difficulty of concisely summarizing Christianity. Therefore, he will only discuss the personality and teachings of this one particular Guru.\n\nThis Guru, emphasizing moral and ultra-moral aspects, possessed a remarkable personality. His impressive blend of gentleness, power, serenity, and vigor, alongside perfect simplicity and an utter lack of self-consciousness, created a profound sense of intimacy and connection, making him seem free from typical social barriers.\n\nDespite this personal rapport, the author quickly discovered a vast intellectual divergence. The Guru's views on subjects like astronomy, physiology, and politics were entirely untouched by Western thought or science, having descended through ancient oral tradition reinforced by sacred texts. Living in a native principality with little exposure to English or Western ideas until mature age, this subtly intelligent man calmly asserted traditional cosmologies: a flat, geocentric Earth where the sun revolves around it and Mount Meru, a great northern hill, serves as a resting place for celestial bodies. He explained lunar eclipses as being caused by \"dark planets\" (Ráku or Kétu) and spoke of 1,008 other planetary systems. He believed the Earth had been repeatedly destroyed and recreated over eons, but divine knowledge, manifesting as Vedas or Upanishads, had always existed in India, which he called a \"Wisdom-land.\" While some of his views aligned with those in *Esoteric Buddhism*, he was unaware of modern theories regarding ancient submerged continents.",

        "content": "His general philosophy appeared to be that of the Siddhantic system, into which I do not propose to go in any detail—as it may be found in the books; and all such systems are hopelessly dull, and may be said to carry their own death-warrants written on their faces. The Indian systems of philosophy bear a strong resemblance to the Gnostic systems of early Christian times—which latter were no doubt derived from the East. They all depend upon the idea of emanation—which is undoubtedly an important idea, and corresponds to some remarkable facts of consciousness; but the special forms in which the idea is cast in the various systems are not very valuable. The universe in the Siddhantic system is composed of five elements—(1) ether, (2) air, (3) fire, (4) water, and (5) earth; and to get over the obvious difficulties which arise from such a classification, it is explained that these are not the gross ether, air, fire, water and earth that we know, but188 subtle elements of the same name—which are themselves perfectly pure but by their admixture produce the gross elements. Thus the air we know is not a true element, but is formed by a mixture of the subtle air with small portions of the subtle ether, subtle fire, subtle water, and subtle earth; and so on. This explains how it is there may be various kinds of air or of water or of earth. Then the five subtle elements give rise to the five forms of sensation in the order named—(1) Sound, (2) Touch, (3) Form, (4) Taste, (5) Smell; and to the five corresponding organs of sense. Also there are five intellectual faculties evolved by admixture from the subtle elements, namely, (1) The inner consciousness, which has the quality of ether or space, (2) Thought (manas) which has the quality of aerial agitation and motion, (3) Reason (buddhi) which has the quality of light and fire, (4) Desire (chittam) which has the emotional rushing character of water, (5) The I-making faculty (ahankára), which has the hardness and resistance of the earth. Also the five organs of action, the voice, the hands, the feet, the anus, and the penis in the same order; and the five vital airs which are supposed to pervade the different parts of the body and to impel their action. This is all very neat and compact. Unfortunately it shares the artificial character which all systems of philosophy have, and which makes it quite impossible to accept any of them. I think our friend quite recognised this; for more than once he said, and quoted the sacred books to the same effect, that “Everything which can be thought is untrue.” In this respect the Indian philosophy189 altogether excels our Western systems (except the most modern). It takes the bottom out of its own little bucket in the most impartial way. Nevertheless, whatever faults they may have, and however easy it may be to attack their thought-forms, the great Indian systems (and those of the West the same) are no doubt based upon deep-lying facts of consciousness, which it must be our business some time to disentangle. I believe there are facts of consciousness underlying such unlikely things as the evolution of the five subtle elements, even though the form of the doctrine may be largely fantastic. The primal element, according to this doctrine, is the ether or space (Akása), the two ideas of space and ether being curiously identified, and the other elements, air, fire, etc., are evolved in succession from this one by a process of thickening or condensation. Now this consciousness of space—not the material space, but the space within the soul—is a form of the supreme consciousness in man, the sat-chit-ánanda Brahm—Freedom, Equality, Extension, Omnipresence—and is accompanied by a sense which has been often described as a combination of all the senses, sight, hearing, touch, etc., in one; so that they do not even appear differentiated from each other. In the course of the descent of the consciousness from this plane to the plane of ordinary life (which may be taken to correspond to the creation of the actual world) the transcendent space-consciousness goes through a sort of obscuration or condensation, and the senses become differentiated into separate and distinct faculties. This—or something like it—is a190 distinct experience. It may well be that the formal doctrine about the five elements is merely an attempt—necessarily very defective, since these things cannot be adequately expressed in that way—to put the thing into a form of thought. And so with other doctrines—some may contain a real inhalt, others may be merely ornamental thought-fringes, put on for the sake of logical symmetry or what not. In its external sense the doctrine of the evolution of the other elements successively by condensation from the ether is after all not so far removed from our modern scientific ideas. For the chief difference between the air, and other such gases, and the ether is supposed by us to be the closeness of the particles in the former; then in the case of fire, the particles come into violent contact, producing light and heat; in fluids their contact has become continuous though mobile; and in the earth and other solids their contact is fixed. However, whatever justification the formal analysis of man and the external world into their constituent parts may have or require, the ultimate object of the analysis in the Indian philosophy is to convince the pupil that He is a being apart from them all. “He whose perception is obscured mistakes the twenty-six tatwas (categories or ‘thats’) for himself, and is under the illusions of ‘I’ and ‘mine.’ To be liberated by the grace of a proper spiritual teacher from the operation of this obscuring power and to realise that these are not self, constitute ‘deliverance.’” Here is the ultimate fact of consciousness—which is the same, and equally true, whatever the analysis of the tatwas may be. 191 “The true quality of the Soul is that of space, by which it is at rest, everywhere. Then,” continued the Guru, “comes the Air quality—by which it moves with speed from place to place; then the Fire-quality, by which it discriminates; then the Water-quality, which gives it emotional flow; and then the Earth or self-quality, rigid and unyielding. As these things evolve out of the soul, so they must involve again, into it and into Brahm.” To go with the five elements, etc., the system expounded by the Guru supposes five shells enclosing the soul. These, with the soul itself, and Brahm, the undifferentiated spirit lying within the soul, form seven planes or sections—as in the Esoteric Buddhism of Sinnett and the Theosophists. The divisions however are not quite identical in the two systems, which appear to be respectively North Indian and South Indian. In the North Indian we have (1) the material body, (2) the vitality, (3) the astral form, (4) the animal soul, (5) the human soul, (6) the soul proper, and (7) the undifferentiated spirit; in the South Indian we have (1) the material shell, (2) the shell of the vital airs, (3) the sensorial shell, (4) the cognitional shell, (5) the shell of oblivion and bliss in sleep, (6) the soul, and (7) the undifferentiated spirit. The two extremes seem the same in the two systems, but the intermediate layers differ. In some respects the latter system is the more effective; it has a stronger practical bearing than the other, and appears to be specially designed as a guide to action in the work of emancipation. In some respects the other system has a wider application. Neither of course have any particular192 value except as convenient forms of thought for their special purposes, and as very roughly embodying in their different degrees various experiences which the human consciousness passes through in the course of its evolution. “It is not till all the five shells have been successively peeled off that consciousness enters the soul and it sees itself and the universal being as one. The first three are peeled off at each bodily death of the man, but they grow again out of what remains. It is not enough to pass beyond these, but beyond the other two also. Then when that is done the student enters into the fulness of the whole universe; and with that joy no earthly joy can for a moment be compared.”",
        "target_summary": "The author discusses a philosophy akin to the Siddhantic system, noting its resemblance to Gnostic systems and shared reliance on the idea of emanation, which corresponds to significant facts of consciousness. While finding such systems often dull and artificial, the author acknowledges they stem from profound conscious experiences.\n\nIn the Siddhantic system, the universe comprises five *subtle* elements—ether, air, fire, water, and earth. These pure, subtle elements intermix to form the *gross* elements we perceive, explaining their variety. From these subtle elements derive:\n1.  Five forms of sensation (sound, touch, form, taste, smell) and their respective sense organs.\n2.  Five intellectual faculties, each linked to an elemental quality: inner consciousness (ether/space), thought (aerial agitation), reason (light/fire), desire (water's emotional rush), and the I-making faculty (earth's hardness).\n3.  Five organs of action (voice, hands, feet, anus, penis).\n4.  Five vital airs that animate the body.\n\nDespite its compact structure, the system's artificiality renders it ultimately unacceptable. The author suggests even its proponents recognized this limitation, citing sacred texts stating, \"Everything which can be thought is untrue.\" This self-critical stance, where Indian philosophy \"takes the bottom out of its own little bucket,\" sets it apart from many Western systems. Nevertheless, these elaborate thought-forms, however flawed, originate from fundamental facts of consciousness awaiting deeper understanding.\n\nThe doctrine posits ether or space (Akása) as the primal element, from which others like air and fire evolve via thickening or condensation. This \"consciousness of space\" (internal, not material) is a manifestation of supreme consciousness (sat-chit-ánanda Brahm—Freedom, Equality, Extension, Omnipresence), characterized by a unified sensory experience. As consciousness descends to ordinary life, this transcendent space-consciousness condenses, and senses differentiate into distinct faculties. This \"distinct experience\" is what the formal doctrine attempts, albeit imperfectly, to capture. This concept of elemental evolution by condensation even bears resemblance to modern scientific understanding of matter's states.\n\nThe ultimate aim of Indian philosophical analysis is to lead individuals to realize their separate existence from the constituent categories, or \"tatwas.\" Liberation is achieved by understanding that \"these are not self.\" A Guru further explains the soul's primary quality as space (rest, omnipresent), from which air (motion), fire (discrimination), water (emotional flow), and earth (rigid self-quality) qualities evolve, destined to re-involve into the soul and Brahm.\n\nTo further elucidate the soul's journey, the system describes seven planes or sections, consisting of five \"shells\" enclosing the soul, the soul itself, and Brahm (the undifferentiated spirit). While comparable to Esoteric Buddhism, the specific divisions differ between North Indian and South Indian systems. The North Indian model includes the material body, vitality, astral form, animal soul, human soul, soul proper, and undifferentiated spirit. The South Indian model lists a material shell, shells of vital airs, sensorial, cognitional, and oblivion/bliss, followed by the soul and undifferentiated spirit. Both systems are considered merely \"convenient forms of thought,\" embodying human conscious experiences during evolution for specific purposes, rather than possessing intrinsic ultimate value.\n\nTrue consciousness, a state of unity with the universal being, is attained only after shedding all five shells. The first three shells are shed at each bodily death but regrow. Permanent liberation requires transcending all five, leading to an experience of the \"fulness of the whole universe\" and unparalleled joy.",

        "content": "“Death,” he continued, “is usually great agony, as if the life was being squeezed out of every part—like the juice out of a sugar-cane; only for those who have already separated their souls from their bodies is it not so. For them it is merely a question of laying down the body at will, when its karma is worked out, or of retaining it, if need be, to prolonged years.” (It is commonly said that Vasishta who first gave the sacred knowledge to mankind, is still living and providing for the earth; and Tilleináthan Swámy is said to have seen Tiruválluvar, the pariah priest who wrote the Kurral over 1,000 years ago.) “In ordinary cases the last thoughts that cling to the body (‘the ruling passion strong in death’) become the seed of the next ensuing body.” In this system the outermost layer of that portion of the human being which survives death is the shell of thought (and desire). As the body is modified in every-day life by the action of the thought-forms193 within and grows out of them—so the new body at some period after death grows out of the thought-forms that survive. “The body is built up by your thought—and not by your thought in this life only, but by the thought of previous lives.” Of the difficult question about hereditary likeness, suggesting that the body is also due to the thought of the parents, he gave no very detailed account,—only that the atomic soul is carried at some period after death (by universal laws, or by its own affinities) into a womb suitable for its next incarnation, where finding kindred thought-forms and elements it assimilates and grows from them, with the result of what is called family likeness. Some of his expositions of Astrology were very interesting to me—particularly to find this world-old system, with all its queer formalities and deep under lying general truths still passively (though I think not actively) accepted and handed down by so able an exponent—but I cannot record them at any length. The five operations of the divine spirit, namely (1) Grace, (2) Obscuration, (3) Destruction, (4) Preservation and (5) Creation, correspond to the five elements, space, air, fire, water and earth, and are embodied in the nine planets, thus: (1) Ráku and Kétu, (2) Saturn, (3) the Sun and Mars, (4) Venus, Mercury and the Moon, (5) Jupiter. It is thus that the birth of a human being is influenced by the position of the planets, i.e. the horoscope. The male semen contains the five elements, and the composition of it is determined by the attitude of the nine planets in the sky! There seems here to be a glimmering embodiment of the deep-lying truth that194 the whole universe conspires in the sexual act, and that the orgasm itself is a flash of the universal consciousness; but the thought-forms of astrology are as indigestible to a mind trained in Western science, as I suppose the thought-forms of the latter are to the philosopher of the East! When I expostulated with the Guru about these, to us, crudities of Astrology, and about such theories as that of the flat earth, the cause of eclipses, etc., bringing the most obvious arguments to attack his position—he did not meet me with any arguments, being evidently unaccustomed to deal with the matter on that plane at all; but simply replied that these things had been seen “in pure consciousness,” and that they were so. It appeared to me pretty clear however that he was not speaking authentically, as having seen them so himself, but simply recording again the tradition delivered in its time to him. And here is a great source of difficulty; for the force of tradition is so tremendous in these matters, and blends so, through the intimate relation of teacher and pupil, with the pupil’s own experience, that I can imagine it difficult in some cases for the pupil to disentangle what is authentically his own vision from that which he has merely heard. Besides—as may be easily imagined—the whole system of teaching tends to paralyse activity on the thought-plane to such a degree that the spirit of healthy criticism has been lost, and things are handed down and accepted in an otiose way without ever being really questioned or properly envisaged. And lastly there is a cause which I think acts sometimes in the same direction, namely that195 the yogi learns—either from habit or from actual experience of a superior order of consciousness—so to despise matters belonging to the thought-world, that he really does not care whether a statement is true or false, in the mundane sense—i.e. consistent or inconsistent with other statements belonging to the same plane. All these causes make it extremely difficult to arrive at what we should call truth as regards matters of fact—appearances alleged to have been seen, feats performed, or the occurrence of past events; and though there may be no prejudice against the possibility of them, it is wise—in cases where definite and unmistakable evidence is absent, to withhold the judgment either way, for or against their occurrence. With regard to these primitive old doctrines of Astronomy, Astrology, Philology, Physiology, etc., handed down from far-back times and still embodied in the teaching of the Gurus, though it is impossible to accept them on the ordinary thought-plane, I think we may yet fairly conclude that there is an element of cosmic consciousness in them, or at any rate in many of them, which has given them their vitality and seal of authority so to speak. I have already explained what I mean, in one or two cases. Just as in the old myths and legends (Andromeda, Cupid and Psyche, Cinderella and a great many more) an effort was made to embody indirectly, in ordinary thought-forms, things seen with the inner eye and which could not be expressed directly—so was the same process carried out in the old science. Though partly occupied with things of the Thought-plane, it was also partly occupied in giving expression196 to things which lie behind that plane—which we in our Western sciences have neither discerned nor troubled ourselves about. Hence, though confused and defective and easily impugnable, it contains an element which is yet of value. Take the theory of the flat earth for instance, already mentioned, with Mount Meru in the north, behind which the sun and moon retire each day. At first it seems almost incredible that a subtle-brained shrewd people should have entertained so crude a theory at all. But it soon appears that while being a rude explanation of external facts and one which might commend itself to a superficial observer, it is also and in reality a description of certain internal phenomena seen. There are a sun and moon within, and there is a Mount Meru (so it is said) within, by which they are obscured. The universe within the soul and the universe without correspond and are the similitudes of each other, and so (theoretically at any rate) the language which describes one should describe the other.",
        "target_summary": "The Guru taught that death is usually an agonizing process unless the soul is already detached from the body; for such individuals, it's a conscious decision to release or retain the body when its karma is complete (citing examples like Vasishta and Tiruválluvar). He explained that one's final thoughts before death form the \"seed\" for the subsequent body, which grows from surviving \"thought-forms\" of past lives. Hereditary likeness occurs when the \"atomic soul\" is drawn to a suitable womb, assimilating kindred thought-forms to develop.\n\nThe Guru's astrological teachings linked five divine operations (Grace, Obscuration, Destruction, Preservation, Creation) to five elements and nine planets, influencing human birth (horoscope) and semen composition. The author found this ancient system interesting, noting its deep truths despite its \"queer formalities,\" acknowledging a universal connection in the sexual act. However, he found astrological concepts incompatible with Western scientific thought.\n\nWhen the author challenged the Guru on astrological \"crudities\" and theories like the flat earth, the Guru simply stated these were seen \"in pure consciousness,\" offering no arguments. The author believed the Guru was relaying tradition, not personal insight, and identified several issues hindering the ascertainment of truth in these teachings: the overwhelming power of tradition blurring personal vision, the stifling of critical thinking, and yogis' potential disregard for mundane accuracy.\n\nDespite these problems and the scientific inconsistencies of ancient doctrines (Astronomy, Astrology, Physiology), the author concluded they held an \"element of cosmic consciousness\" or expressed inner truths. He proposed that, similar to myths, ancient sciences might use ordinary thought-forms to convey indirectly perceived inner realities. For instance, the \"flat earth\" theory, though a crude external explanation, could actually describe internal phenomena like an inner sun, moon, and Mount Meru, reflecting a correspondence between the inner and outer universes.",

        "content": "It is well known that much of the mediæval alchemy had this double signification—the terms used indicated two classes of facts. Sometimes the inner meaning preponderated, sometimes the outer; and it is not always easy to tell in the writings of the Alchemists which is specially intended. This alchemical teaching came into Europe from the East—as we know; yet it was not without a feeling of surprise that I heard the Guru one day expounding as one of the ancient traditions of his own country a doctrine that I seemed familiar with as coming from Paracelsus or some such author—that of the transmutation197 of copper into gold by means of solidified mercury. There is a method he explained, preserved in mystic language in some of the ancient books, by which mercury can be rendered solid. This solid mercury has extraordinary properties: it is proof against the action of fire; if you hold a small piece of it in your mouth, arrows and bullets cannot harm you; and the mere touch of it will turn a lump of copper into gold. Now this doctrine has been recognised by students of the mediæval alchemy to have an esoteric meaning. Quicksilver or mercury—as I think I have already mentioned—is an image or embodiment of Thought itself, the ever-glancing, ever-shifting; to render quicksilver solid is to fix thought, and so to enter into the transcendent consciousness. He who does that can be harmed neither by arrows nor by bullets; a touch of that diviner principle turns the man whose nature is but base copper into pure gold. The Guru however expounded this as if in a purely literal and external sense; and on my questioning him it became evident that he believed in some at any rate of the alchemical transmutations in this sense—though what evidence he may have had for such belief did not appear. I remember very well the evening on which this conversation took place. We were walking along an unfrequented bit of road or by-lane; the sky was transparent with the colors of sunset, the wooded hills a few miles off looked blue through the limpid air. He strode along—a tall dark figure with coal-black eyes—on raised wooden sandals or clogs—his white wrapper loosely encircling him—with198 so easy and swift a motion that it was quite a consideration to keep up with him—discoursing all the while on the wonderful alchemical and medical secrets preserved from ages back in the slokas of the sacred books—how in order to safeguard this arcane knowledge, and to render it inaccessible to the vulgar, methods had been adopted of the transposition of words, letters, etc., which made the text mere gibberish except to those who had the key; how there still existed a great mass of such writings, inscribed on palm and other leaves, and stored away in the temples and monasteries—though much had been destroyed—and so forth; altogether a strange figure—something uncanny and superhuman about it. I found it difficult to believe that I was in the end of the nineteenth century, and not three or four thousand years back among the sages of the Vedic race; and indeed the more I saw of this Guru the more I felt persuaded (and still feel) that in general appearance, dress, mental attitude, and so forth, he probably resembled to an extraordinary degree those ancient teachers whose tradition he still handed down. The more one sees of India the more one learns to appreciate the enormous tenacity of custom and tradition there, and that the best means to realise its past may be to study its present life in the proper quarters. His criticisms of the English, of English rule in India, and of social institutions generally, were very interesting—to me at any rate—as coming from a man so perfectly free from Western “taint” and modern modes of thought, and who yet had had considerable experience of state policy and administration199 in his time, and who generally had circled a considerable experience of life. He said—what was quite a new idea to me, but in the most emphatic way—that the rule of the English in the time of the East India Company had been much better than it had become since under the Crown. Curiously enough his charge was that “the Queen” had made it so entirely commercial. The sole idea now, he said, is money. Before ’57 there had been some kind of State policy, some idea of a large and generous rule, and of the good of the people, but in the present day the rule was essentially feeble, with no defined policy of any kind except that of the money bag. This criticism impressed me much, as corroborating from an entirely independent source the growth of mere commercialism in Britain during late years, and of the nation-of-shopkeepers theory of government. Going on to speak of government generally, his views would I fear hardly be accepted by the schools—they were more Carlylean in character. “States,” he said, “must be ruled by Justice, and then they will succeed.” (An ancient doctrine, this, but curiously neglected all down history.) “A king should stand and did stand in old times as the representative of Siva (God). He is nothing in himself—no more than the people—his revenue is derived from them—he is elected by them—and he is in trust to administer justice—especially criminal justice. In the courtyard of the palace at Tanjore there hung at one time a bell which the rajah placed there in order that any one feeling himself aggrieved might come and ring it, and so claim redress or200 judgment. Justice or Equality,” he continued, “is the special attribute of God; and he who represents God, i.e. the king, must consider this before all things. The same with rich people—they are bound to serve and work for the poor from whom their riches come.” This last sentence he repeated so often, at different times and in different forms, that he might almost have been claimed as a Socialist—certainly was a Socialist in the heart of the matter; and at any rate this teaching shows how near the most ancient traditions come to the newest doctrines in these respects, and how far the unclean commercialism out of which we are just passing stands from either. As to the English people he seemed to think them hopelessly plunged in materialism, but said that if they did turn to “sensible pursuits” (i.e. of divine knowledge) their perseverance and natural sense of justice and truth would, he thought, stand them in good stead. The difficulties of the gnosis in England were however very great; “those who do attain some degree of emancipation there do not know that they have attained; though having experience they lack knowledge.” “You in the West,” he continued, “say O God, O God! but you have no definite knowledge or methods by which you can attain to see God. It is like a man who knows there is ghee (butter) to be got out of a cow (pasu, metaph. for soul). He walks round and round the cow and cries, O Ghee, O Ghee! Milk pervades the cow, but he cannot find it. Then when he has learned to handle the teat, and has obtained the milk, he still201 cannot find the ghee. It pervades the milk and has also to be got by a definite method. So there is a definite method by which the divine consciousness can be educed from the soul, but it is only in India that complete instruction exists on this point—by which a man who is ‘ripe’ may systematically and without fail attain the object of his search, and by which the mass of the people may ascend as by a ladder from the very lowest stages to such ‘ripeness.’”",
        "target_summary": "This book excerpt explores the dual nature of medieval alchemy and presents the teachings of an Indian Guru on various subjects, including spiritual and political philosophy. The narrator recalls learning from the Guru about an ancient tradition, similar to European alchemists like Paracelsus, concerning the transmutation of copper into gold using solidified mercury. The Guru described mystic methods to solidify mercury, imbuing it with extraordinary properties: it becomes fireproof, offers protection from physical harm like arrows and bullets, and can instantly turn copper into gold by touch. However, scholars of medieval alchemy recognize an esoteric meaning behind this doctrine, interpreting mercury as an embodiment of ever-shifting thought. To solidify mercury, therefore, symbolizes fixing thought to achieve transcendent consciousness. This \"diviner principle\" is what spiritually transforms a base individual (copper) into pure \"gold\" and grants true immunity, rather than literal physical protection or material transmutation. The Guru, however, presented this doctrine in a purely literal sense, evidently believing in the physical transmutations, though his evidence remained undisclosed.\n\nThe conversation occurred during a sunset walk with the Guru, a tall, dark figure in traditional attire who moved with striking ease. He discoursed on ancient alchemical and medical secrets preserved in sacred Indian texts (slokas). He explained that this arcane knowledge was intentionally safeguarded from the \"vulgar\" by methods like word and letter transposition, making the texts incomprehensible without the correct key. Many such writings, inscribed on palm leaves, were still stored in temples and monasteries, despite much being destroyed. The narrator was profoundly struck by the Guru's ancient appearance and mental attitude, feeling transported back thousands of years and recognizing his resemblance to the ancient Vedic teachers whose traditions he upheld, illustrating India's remarkable tenacity of custom.\n\nThe Guru, unaffected by Western thought, also offered incisive criticisms of English rule in India. He emphatically stated that the East India Company's administration (pre-1857) was far better than the subsequent Crown rule, which he accused of becoming \"entirely commercial.\" He argued that the Crown's governance was solely focused on money, lacking the broader vision for state policy and the people's welfare that existed previously. His views on government, which the narrator deemed \"Carlylean,\" emphasized justice as paramount. He believed kings, as representatives of Siva (God), were elected by the people, derived their revenue from them, and were primarily entrusted to administer justice, particularly criminal justice, citing historical examples like a bell at Tanjore palace for citizens to claim redress. Furthermore, he frequently reiterated that the wealthy were obligated to serve the poor, a principle the narrator considered essentially socialist.\n\nRegarding the English people, the Guru perceived them as largely materialistic but believed their perseverance and innate sense of justice and truth could serve them well if they turned to \"divine knowledge.\" He highlighted the considerable difficulties of spiritual gnosis in England, noting that even those who achieve some emancipation often lack the knowledge to recognize it, despite having the experience. He criticized Westerners for merely crying \"O God!\" without possessing definite methods to truly attain divine vision. He illustrated this with an analogy: just as knowing ghee comes from a cow is insufficient without the specific method to extract milk and then process it into ghee, Westerners lack the systematic process to elicit divine consciousness from the soul. He asserted that definite methods exist for this, but complete and systematic instruction for achieving this \"ripeness\"—for both individuals and the general populace to ascend spiritually—is uniquely preserved and available only in India.",

        "content": "India, he said, was the divine land, and the source from which the divine knowledge had always radiated over the earth. Sanskrit and Tamil were divine languages—all other languages being of lower caste and origin. In India the conditions were in every way favorable to attainment, but in other lands not so. Some Mahomedans had at different times adopted the Indian teaching and become Gñánis, but it had always been in India, and not in their own countries that they had done so. Indeed the Mahomedan religion, though so different from the Hindu, had come from India, and was due to a great Rishi who had quarrelled with the Brahmans and had established forms and beliefs in a spirit of opposition to them. When I asked him what he thought of Christ, he said he was probably an adept in gñánam, but his hearers had been the rude mass of the people and his teaching had been suited to their wants. Though these views of his on the influence of India and its wisdom-religion on the world may appear, and probably are in their way, exaggerated; yet they are partly justified by two facts which appear to me practically certain: (1) that in every202 age of the world and in almost every country there has been a body of doctrine handed down, which, with whatever variations and obscurations, has clustered round two or three central ideas, of which perhaps that of emancipation from self through repeated births is the most important; so that there has been a kind of tacit understanding and freemasonry on this subject between the great teachers throughout history—from the Eastern sages, down through Pythagoras, Plato, Paul, the Gnostic schools, the great mediæval Alchemists, the German mystics and others, to the great philosophers and poets of our own time; and that thousands of individuals on reaching a certain stage of evolution have corroborated and are constantly corroborating from their own experience the main points of this doctrine; and (2) that there must have existed in India, or in some neighboring region from which India drew its tradition, before all history, teachers who saw these occult facts and understood them probably better than the teachers of historical times, and who had themselves reached a stage of evolution at least equal to any that has been attained since. If this is so then there is reason to believe that there is a distinct body of experience and knowledge into which the whole human race is destined to rise, and which there is every reason to believe will bring wonderful and added faculties with it. From whatever mere formalities or husks of tradition or abnormal growths have gathered round it in India, this has to be disentangled; but it is not now any more to be the heritage of India alone, but for the whole world. If however any one should seek it203 for the advantage or glory to himself of added powers and faculties, his quest will be in vain, for it is an absolute condition of attainment that all action for self as distinct from others shall entirely cease.",
        "target_summary": "The speaker asserted India was the divine land and source of all divine knowledge, viewing Sanskrit and Tamil as divine languages superior to others. He claimed India offered uniquely favorable conditions for spiritual attainment, noting that even Mahomedans who adopted Indian teachings did so only in India. He further suggested the Mahomedan religion originated in India from a great Rishi who opposed the Brahmans. Regarding Christ, the speaker believed he was an adept in *gñánam*, but tailored his teachings for a common populace.\n\nThe author acknowledges these views might be exaggerated but finds them partially justified by two facts. Firstly, a universal doctrine, centered on emancipation from self through repeated births, has been consistently transmitted across diverse cultures and historical periods—from ancient sages to modern philosophers—and is corroborated by individuals' experiences. Secondly, ancient teachers in India (or a neighboring region) likely possessed a deeper understanding of these occult facts and reached higher stages of evolution than those in historical times.\n\nThis suggests humanity is destined to attain a distinct body of elevated experience and knowledge, promising new faculties. This wisdom, needing to be disentangled from India's traditional \"husks,\" is meant for the entire world, not just India. However, its attainment strictly requires the complete cessation of all self-serving actions.",

        "content": "Leaving Colombo by steamer one evening in the later part of January, I landed on the sandy flat shores of Tuticorin the next day about noon. The deck was crowded with 250 of the poorest class of Tamils, coolies mostly, with women and children, lying in decent confusion heaped upon one another, passively but sadly enduring the evil motion of the ship and the cold night air. One man, nameless, unknown, and abjectly thin, died in the night and was cast overboard. I was the only Englishman on board beside the captain and officers. Said the second officer, “Well, I would rather have these fellows than a lot of English emigrants. The lowest class of English are the damnedest, dirtiest, etceteraest etceteras in the world.” Tuticorin is a small place with a large cotton mill, several Roman Catholic churches and chapels, relics of Portuguese times, and a semi-christianised semi-wage-slaving native population. From there to Madras is about two days by rail through the great plains of the Carnatic, which stretch between the sea-shore and the Ghauts—long stretches of sand and scrub, scattered bushes and small trees, and the kittool palm; paddy at intervals where the land is moister, and considerable quantities of cotton on the210 darker soil near Tuticorin; mud and thatch villages under clumps of coco-palm (not such fine trees as in Ceylon); and places of village worship—a portico or shrine with a great clay elephant or half-circle of rude images of horses facing it; the women working in the fields or stacking the rice-straw in stacks similar to our corn-stacks; the men drawing water from their wells to run along the irrigation channels, or in some cases actually carrying the water in pots to pour over their crops! These plains, like the plains of the Ganges, have been the scene of an advanced civilization from early times, and have now for two thousand years at any rate been occupied by the Tamil populations. Fergusson in his History of Architecture speaks of thirty great Dravidian temples to be found in this region, “any one of which must have cost as much to build as an English cathedral.” I visited three, those of Mádura, Tanjore, and Chidámbaram; which I will describe, taking that at Tanjore first, as having the most definite form and plan. I have already (chap. VII.) given some account of a smaller Hindu temple. The temples in this region are on the same general plan. There is no vast interior as in a Western cathedral, but they depend for their effect rather upon the darkness and inaccessibility of the inner shrines and passages, and upon the gorgeous external assemblage of towers and porticos and tanks and arcades brought together within the same enclosure. At Mádura the whole circumference of the temple is over 1, 000 yards, and at Sri Rungam each side of the enclosure is as much as half a mile long. In every case there has211 no doubt been an original shrine of the god, round which buildings have accumulated, the external enclosure being thrown out into a larger and larger circumference as time went on; and in many cases the later buildings, the handsome outlying gateways or gópuras and towers, have by their size completely dwarfed the shrine to which they are supposed to be subsidiary, thus producing a poor artistic effect.",
        "target_summary": "In late January, the author traveled by steamer from Colombo to Tuticorin, arriving at noon. The crowded deck held 250 poor Tamil coolies, women, and children, one of whom died overnight and was cast overboard. The author, the only Englishman besides the crew, overheard the second officer express a preference for these Tamils over \"the lowest class of English emigrants.\" Tuticorin was a small town with a large cotton mill, Roman Catholic churches from Portuguese times, and a \"semi-christianised semi-wage-slaving\" native population.\n\nFrom Tuticorin, the author took a two-day rail journey to Madras, crossing the great plains of the Carnatic. This region featured stretches of sand and scrub, scattered bushes, small trees, kittool palms, and paddy fields where the land was moist, with considerable cotton cultivation on darker soils near Tuticorin. Villages of mud and thatch were nestled under coco-palms, with local worship places featuring clay elephants or rude horse images. Women worked in fields or stacked rice-straw, while men drew or carried water for irrigation.\n\nThese plains, historically the site of advanced civilizations, have been continuously occupied by Tamil populations for at least two thousand years. Fergusson's *History of Architecture* noted thirty great Dravidian temples in this region, each comparable in building cost to an English cathedral. The author visited three: Mádura, Tanjore, and Chidámbaram, intending to describe Tanjore first. Unlike Western cathedrals with vast interiors, these Hindu temples rely on the darkness and inaccessibility of their inner shrines, combined with a magnificent external complex of towers, porticos, tanks, and arcades within a single enclosure. Their scale is immense, with Madura's temple circumference exceeding 1,000 yards and Sri Rungam's enclosure sides measuring half a mile. Temples typically evolved from an original shrine, with surrounding buildings and larger enclosures accumulating over time. Often, later, grander outlying gateways (gópuras) overshadowed the original shrine, producing a \"poor artistic effect.\"",

        "content": "In the temple at Tanjore the great court is 170 yards long by 85 wide. You enter through a gateway forming a pyramidal structure 40 or 50 feet high, ornamented with the usual carved figures of Siva and his demon doorkeepers, and find yourself in a beautiful courtyard, flagged, with an arcade running round three sides, the fourth side being occupied by priests’ quarters; clumps of coco-palms and other trees throw a grateful shade here and212 there; in front of you rises the great pyramidal tower, or pagoda, 190 feet high, which surmounts the main shrine, and between the shrine and yourself is an open portico on stone pillars, beneath which reposes a huge couchant bull, about six yards long and four yards high, said to be cut from a solid block of syenite brought 400 miles from the quarries. This bull is certainly very primitive work, and is quite brown and saturated with constant libations of oil; but whether it is 2,700 years old, as the people here say, is another question. The difficulty of determining dates in these matters is very great; historical accuracy is unknown in this land; and architectural style gives but an uncertain clue, since it has probably changed but little. Thus we have the absurdity that while natives of education and intelligence are asserting on the one hand that some of these temples are five or even ten thousand years old, the Western architects assert equally strongly that they can find no work in them of earlier date than 1000 A.D., while much of it belongs to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Probably the architects are in the main right. It is quite probable however that the inner shrines in most of these cases are extremely old, much older than 1000 A.D.; but they are so buried beneath later work, and access to them is so difficult, and if access were obtained their more primitive style would so baffle chronology, that the question must yet remain undetermined. Close to the bull is the kampam or flagstaff, and then, beyond, a flight of steps leading up to the main sanctuary and the tower or pagoda. The sanctuary is all fine and simple work of red sandstone213 in which horizontal lines predominate. At its far end and under the pagoda would be no doubt the inner shrine or holy of holies—the vimana or womb of the temple, a cubical chamber, in which the lingam would be placed. Into these mysteries we did not penetrate, but contented ourselves with looking at the pagoda from the outside. It is a very dignified and reposeful piece of work, supposed by Fergusson to belong to the early part of the fourteenth century; ninety-six feet square at the base, with vertical sides for about fifty feet, and then gradually drawing in narrower through thirteen stories to the summit (see plate at head of this chapter). The red sandstone walls at the base are finely and quietly paneled, with statues of Siva—not grotesque, but dignified and even graceful—in the niches. Higher up in the pyramidal part the statues are fewer, and are mingled with couchant bulls and flame-like designs composed of multitudinous cobras and conches and discs (symbols of the god—who is lord of Time, the revolving disc, and of Space, represented by the sounding conch) in tiers of continually diminishing size to the summit, where a small dome—said to be also a single massive block of stone—is surmounted by a golden pinnacle. The natural red of the stone which forms the lower walls is artificially deepened in the panels, and the traces of blue and green tints remaining, together with silvery and brown incrustations of lichen in the upper parts, give a wonderful richness to the whole. I am afraid however that the pyramidal structure is not stone, but brick covered with plaster. The frequency of the bull everywhere throughout this214 and other Saivite temples reminds one of the part played by the same animal in Persian and Egyptian worship, and of the import of the Zodiacal sign Taurus as a root-element of the solar religions. The general structure and disposition of these buildings might I should think also recall the Jewish and Egyptian temples. All round the base of the great sanctuary and in other parts of the temple at Tanjore are immense inscriptions—in Telugu, says one of the Brahmans, but I cannot tell—some very fresh and apparently modern, others nearly quite obliterated. The absolute incapacity shown by the Hindus for reasoned observation in religious matters was illustrated by my guide—who did not in other respects appear to be at all a stickler for his religion. When he first called my attention to the pagoda he said, adding to his praise of its beauty, “Yes, and it never casts a shadow, never any shadow.” Of course I did not trouble to argue such a point, and as we were standing at the time on the sunlit side of the building there certainly was no shadow visible there. Presently however—after say half an hour—we got round to the other side, and were actually standing in the shadow, which was then quite extensive, it being only about 9 a.m., and the sun completely hidden from us by the pagoda; I had forgotten all about the matter; when the guide said again and with enthusiasm, “And it has no shadow.” Then seeing my face (!) he added, “No, this is not the shadow.” “But,” said I, “it is.” “No,” he repeated, “this is not the shadow of the pagoda, for that never casts any shadow”—and then he turned215 for corroboration to an old half-naked Brahman standing by, who of course repeated the formula—and with an air of mechanical conviction which made me at once feel that further parley was useless. It might seem strange to any one not acquainted with the peculiarities of human nature that people should go on perhaps for centuries calmly stating an obvious contradiction in terms like that, without ever so to speak turning a hair! But so it is, and I am afraid even we Westerners can by no means claim to be innocent of the practice. Among the Hindus, however, in connection with religion this feature is really an awkward one. Acute and subtle as they are, yet when religion comes on the field their presence of mind forsakes them, and they make the most wild and unjustifiable statements. I am sorry to say I have never witnessed a real good thungeing miracle myself. We have all heard plenty of stories of such things in India, and I have met various Hindus of ability and culture who evidently quite believed them, but (although quite willing and ready-equipped to believe them myself) I have always felt, since that experience of the shadow, that one “couldn’t be too careful.” On either side of the great pagoda, and standing separate in the courtyard, are two quite small temples dedicated, one to Ganésa and the other to Soubramániya, very elegant, both of them; and one or two stone pandals or porticos for resting places of the gods in processions. One can imagine what splendid arenas for processions and festivals these courts must afford, in which enormous crowds sometimes216 assemble to take part in ceremonials similar to that which I have described in chapter VII. Owing however to former desecrations by the French (who in 1777 fortified the temple itself), and present treatment by the British Government, this Tanjore temple is not so much frequented as it used to be. The late Rajah of Tanjore, prior to 1857, supported the place of course with handsome funds; but the British Government only undertakes necessary repairs and allows a pension of four rupees a month to the existing temple servants. They are therefore in a poor way. The arcade at the far end and down one side of the court is frescoed with the usual grotesque subjects—flying elephants trampling on unbelievers, rajahs worshiping the god, women bathing, etc., and is furnished the whole way with erect stone lingams—there must be at least a hundred of them. These lingams are cylindrical stones a foot and a half high or so, and eight or nine inches thick, some bigger, some smaller, standing in sort of oval troughs, which catch the oil which is constantly poured over the lingams. Women desiring children pay their offerings here, of flowers and oil, and at certain festivals these shrines are, notwithstanding their number, greatly in request.",
        "target_summary": "The great court of the Tanjore temple, measuring 170 by 85 yards, is entered through a 40-50 foot high pyramidal gateway (gopuram) adorned with carvings of Siva and demon doorkeepers. Inside, a flagged courtyard features an arcade, priests' quarters, and coco-palms, leading to the main 190-foot high pyramidal tower (pagoda) surmounting the shrine. An open portico houses a massive, couchant syenite bull, about six yards long and four yards high, said to be cut from a block brought 400 miles. This primitive, oil-saturated bull, claimed to be 2,700 years old, raises questions about dating, as historical accuracy is poor in India, and architectural styles offer uncertain clues. While natives assert temples are millennia old, Western architects find no work earlier than 1000 A.D., much of it from the 16th-17th centuries; though inner shrines might be far older, their inaccessibility and primitive style hinder chronology.\n\nBeyond the bull and a flagstaff, steps ascend to the sanctuary, a simple, fine red sandstone structure with horizontal lines. The cubical inner shrine, or vimana, intended for the lingam, was not visited. The pagoda itself is a dignified and reposeful structure, dated by Fergusson to the early 14th century. It is 96 feet square at the base, rising vertically for fifty feet before tapering through thirteen stories to a summit crowned by a small dome and golden pinnacle. Its red sandstone base features finely paneled walls with dignified Siva statues. Higher up, the pyramidal sections have fewer statues, mingled with couchant bulls and flame-like designs composed of cobras, conches, and discs (symbols of Siva as lord of Time and Space), diminishing in size. The stone's natural red is artificially deepened, with traces of blue/green tints and silvery lichen adding richness, although the pyramidal structure is likely brick covered in plaster. The ubiquitous bull in Saivite temples recalls its role in Persian/Egyptian worship and the Zodiacal Taurus; the temple's general layout might also reflect Jewish and Egyptian designs.\n\nLarge, varied inscriptions, some fresh, some obliterated, cover the sanctuary base. The author recounts an incident illustrating the \"incapacity for reasoned observation in religious matters\" among Hindus: his guide repeatedly insisted the pagoda cast no shadow, even as they stood fully within its shade, dismissing the visible shadow as \"not the shadow.\" This mechanical conviction, echoed by another Brahman, highlighted the difficulty of logical discourse in religious contexts for Hindus and made the author cautious about \"miracles.\"\n\nThe courtyard also contains two elegant smaller temples dedicated to Ganésa and Soubramániya, and stone pandals for gods during processions. However, the temple is less frequented now due to 1777 French desecrations and the British Government's limited support (only repairs and small pensions), contrasting with the former Rajah's generous patronage. The arcade features frescoes of grotesque subjects and is lined with at least a hundred cylindrical stone lingams, about 1.5 feet high, in troughs. These receive constant oil offerings from women seeking children and are especially popular during festivals.",

        "content": "The ancient city of Mádura, though with a population of 60,000, is even more humble in appearance than Tanjore. At first sight it looks like a mere collection of mud cabins—though of course there are English bungalows on the outskirts, and a court-house and a church and an American mission-room and school, and the rest. The weavers are a strong caste here; they weave silk (and cotton) saris, though with failing trade as against the incoming machine-products of capitalism—and you see their crimson-dyed pieces stretched on frames in the streets. The choultrie leading up to one of the temple gates is a colonnade 110 yards long, a central walk and two aisles, with carven monolithic columns—a warrior sitting on a rearing horse trampling shields of soldiers and slaying men or tigers, or a huge218 seated king or god, in daring crudeness—and great capitals supporting a stone roof. Choultries were used as public feeding-halls and resting-places for Brahmans, as well as for various ceremonies, and in old days when the Brahmans were all-powerful such places were everywhere at their service, and they had a high old time. This choultrie has however been turned into a silk and cotton market, and was gay, when I saw it, with crowds of people, and goods pinned up to the columns. Emerging from it, the eastern gate of the temple stands on the opposite side of the road—a huge gópura, pagoda form, fifteen stories or so high, each tier crowded with figures—Siva hideous with six arms and protruding eyes and teeth, Siva dancing, Siva contemplative, Siva and Sakti on the bull, demon doorkeepers, etc.—the whole picked out in the usual crude reds, yellows, greens, blues, and branching out at top into grotesque dragon-forms—a strange piece of work, yet having an impressive total effect, as it rises 200 feet into the resplendent sky over the little mud and thatch cottages—its crude details harmonised in the intense blaze, and its myriad nooks of shadow haunted by swallows, doves and other birds. There are nine such gópuras or gate-towers in all in this temple, all on much the same plan, ranging from 40 to 200 feet in height, and apparently used to some extent as dwelling-places by priests, yogis, and others. These, together with the various halls, shrines, tanks, arcades, etc., form a huge enclosure 280 yards long by nearly 250 wide. On entering the huge doorway of the eastern219 gópura one finds oneself immediately in a wilderness of columns—the hall of a thousand columns—besides arcades, courts, and open and covered spaces,—a labyrinth full of people (for this temple is much frequented)—many of whom are selling wares, but here more for temple use, flowers for offerings, cakes of cowdung ashes for rubbing on the forehead, embroidered bags to put these in, money-changers, elephants here and there, with bundles of green stuff among the columns, elephant-keepers, the populace arriving with offerings, and plentiful Brahmans going to and fro. The effect of the numerous columns—and there are fully a thousand of them, fifteen feet high or so—is very fine—the light and shade, glimpses of sky or trees through avenues of carved monsters, or cavernous labyrinths of the same ending in entire darkness: grotesque work and in detail often repulsive, but lending itself in the mass to the general effect—Siva dancing again, or Ganésa with huge belly and elephant head, or Parvati with monstrous breasts—“all out of one stone, all out of one stone,” the guide keeps repeating: feats of marvelous patience (e.g. a chain of separate links all cut from the same block), though ugly enough very often in themselves. And now skirting round the inner sanctuary to the left, we come into a sort of cloister opening on a tank some fifty yards square, from whence we get a more general view of the place, and realise its expanse. The five or six gópuras visible from our standpoint serve to indicate this—all painted in strong color but subdued by distance, roofs of various portions of the temple, clumps of palm and220 other trees, two gold-plated turrets shining brilliantly in the sun, the tank itself with handsome stone tiers and greenish waters where the worshipers wash their feet, the cloisters frescoed with elaborate legendary designs, and over all in the blue sky flocks of birds—swallows, doves, and bright green parrots chattering. Once more we plunge into dark galleries full of hungry-eyed Brahmans, and passing the shrine of Minakshi, into which we cannot gain admittance, come into the very sombre and striking corridor which runs round the entire inner shrine. The huge monoliths here are carven with more soberness and grace, and the great capitals bear cross-beams which in their turn support projecting architraves. Hardly a soul do we meet as we make the circuit of the three sides. The last turn brings us to the entrance of the inner sanctuary itself; and here is the gold-plated kambam which I have already described (chap. VII.), and close behind it the bull Nandi and the gloom of the interior lit only by a distant lamp or two. To these inner parts come only those who wish to meditate in quiet; and in some secluded corner may one occasionally be seen, seated on the floor with closed eyes and crossed legs, losing or endeavoring to lose himself in samádhi. Outside the temple in the streets of Mádura we saw three separate Juggernath cars, used on occasions in processions. These cars are common enough even in small Hindu towns. They are unwieldy massive things, often built in several tiers, and with solid wooden wheels on lumbering wooden axles, which look as if they were put on221 (and probably are) in such a way as to cause the maximum of resistance to motion. At Streevelliputhur there is a car thirty feet high, with wheels eight feet in diameter. The people harness themselves to these things literally in thousands; the harder the car is to move, the greater naturally is the dignity of the god who rides upon it, and the excitement becomes intense when he is at last fairly got under weigh. But I have not witnessed one of these processions.",

The cloisters are frescoed with elaborate designs, and various birds fill the sky. Further into dark galleries, past the inaccessible Minakshi shrine, a sombre corridor encircles the inner shrine. Here, huge monoliths are carved with more sobriety and grace, and few people are encountered. The final turn leads to the innermost sanctuary, featuring a gold-plated *kambam*, the bull Nandi, and a dimly lit interior. This secluded area is for quiet meditation, where individuals seek *samádhi*.\n\nOutside the temple, Juggernath cars are seen, massive, multi-tiered structures used for processions. Their solid wooden wheels are designed to maximize resistance to motion, and thousands of people harness themselves to them. The greater the difficulty in moving the car, the higher the perceived dignity of the god and the more intense the excitement when it finally begins to move.",

        "content": "The temple of Chidámbaram is in some respects more interesting than those of Tanjore and Mádura. It is in fact more highly thought of as a goal of pilgrimage and a place of festival than any other South Indian temple, and may be said to be the Benares of South India. The word Chidámbaram means region of pure consciousness, and Siva is worshiped here under his most excellent name of Nátarája, lord of the dance. “O thou who dancest thy illimitable dance in the heaven of pure consciousness.” There is a little railway station of Chidámbaram, but it is two or three miles from the temple and the town; and though the town itself numbers some 20,000 to 30,000 inhabitants, there is not a single Englishman resident in the place or within some miles of it, the only white-faced inhabitant being a Eurasian druggist who keeps a shop there. When I was there the whole temple was in course of repair, and the Brahmans were such a nuisance that I really did not get so good an idea of the place as I could have wished. These gentry swarm here, and222 descend upon one like birds of prey, in quest of tips; indeed the physiognomy of a great many of them suggests the kite family—sharp eyes, rather close together, and a thin aquiline nose; this with their large foreheads looking all the larger on account of the shaven head does not give a very favorable impression. The ascendancy of the Brahman caste is certainly a very remarkable historical fact. It is possible that at one time they really resembled the guardians of Plato’s ideal republic—teachers and rulers who themselves possessed nothing and were supported by the contributions of the people; but before so many centuries had gone by they must have made the first part of their functions subsidiary to the second, and now—though a good many of them ply trades and avocations of one kind or another—the majority are mere onhangers of the temples, where they become sharers of the funds devoted to the temple services, and bleed the pockets of pious devotees. When a Hindu of any worldly substance approaches one of these places, he is immediately set upon by five or six loafers of this kind—each of whom claims that his is the Brahman family which has always done the priestly services for the visitor’s family (and indeed they do keep careful note of these matters), and that he therefore should conduct the visitor to the proper quarter of the temple, take his offerings to the god, and receive his reward accordingly. This temple is I should think about the same size as that at Mádura, but more open like the Tanjore temple. There are four gópuras of about equal223 size—120 feet high or so—at the four points of the compass. On entering by the eastern one the hall of a thousand columns stands away in the court to the right, and gives the idea of a complete temple in itself. The sides and back end are closed in, but the front forms a sort of portico, and columns similar to those of the portico—every one a monolith—extend through the entire interior. There is a lane or aisle down the middle, and then on each side they stand thick, in rows perhaps ten feet apart. As you go in the gloom gets deeper and deeper. Only here and there a gap in the external wall throws a weird light. The whole suggests a rock cave cut in multitudinous pillars to support the overlying weight, or a gloomy forest of tree-trunks. But the columns are commonplace in themselves, and their number and closeness together under a flat roof of no great weight is not architecturally admirable. When you reach the interior sanctum, where you might expect to find the god at home, you discover a mere bare cavity, so dark that you cannot see the roof, and occupied by innumerable bats who resent your intrusion with squeaks and shrieks. But my guide explained to me that twice a year the god does come to dwell there, and then they clean the place up and decorate it with lamps for a season. A large tank stands just west of this hall—a tank 200 feet long I should think—in which men (and women) were washing their feet and clothes. These tanks are attached to every temple. At Mádura there is a very beautiful one, “the golden lotus tank,” two miles away from the temple, with a224 pagoda on an island in the midst of it—to which they resort at the Taypúsam festival. Also at Mylapore, Madras, there is a handsome tank with pagoda just outside the temple; but mostly they are within the precincts.",
        "target_summary": "The Chidámbaram temple is considered more significant than Tanjore or Mádura, ranking as South India's foremost pilgrimage and festival site—its \"Benares.\" Its name, meaning \"region of pure consciousness,\" reflects the worship of Siva as Nátarája, \"lord of the dance,\" embodying an \"illimitable dance in the heaven of pure consciousness.\" The town, with 20,000-30,000 inhabitants, has a railway station a few miles from the temple, but notably, no Englishmen reside there; the only white-faced person is a Eurasian druggist.\n\nDuring the author's visit, the temple was under repair, and the pervasive presence of Brahmans, constantly seeking tips, proved to be a significant nuisance, impairing the experience. These Brahmans are described as \"swarming\" and \"descend[ing] upon one like birds of prey.\" Their \"kite family\" physiognomy—sharp, close-set eyes, thin aquiline noses, and large foreheads accentuated by shaven heads—left an unfavorable impression. The author reflects on the historical ascendancy of the Brahman caste, suggesting they might once have resembled Plato's guardians—teachers and rulers who owned nothing and were community-supported. However, over centuries, many have become mere \"on-hangers\" of temples, sharing funds and perceived as \"bleeding the pockets of pious devotees.\" They aggressively approach wealthy visitors, claiming inherited priestly service to the visitor's family (a fact they meticulously track) to guide them through the temple, handle offerings, and secure their rewards.\n\nArchitecturally, the Chidámbaram temple is comparable in size to Mádura's but features a more open layout, similar to the Tanjore temple. It boasts four substantial gópuras, each approximately 120 feet high, situated at the cardinal points. Entering the eastern gopura leads to the \"hall of a thousand columns\" in the right-hand court, which appears as a complete temple within the complex. This hall has enclosed sides and back, a portico front, and an interior filled with monolith columns. These are arranged with a central aisle, flanked by thick rows of columns about ten feet apart. The interior becomes progressively gloomy, with only occasional light from external wall gaps creating an eerie ambiance, evoking a rock cave with carved pillars or a somber forest. Despite this, the columns themselves are deemed commonplace, and their sheer number and proximity under a relatively light flat roof are not architecturally admired.\n\nThe inner sanctum, surprisingly, is a \"mere bare cavity,\" so dark that the roof is invisible, and inhabited by innumerable bats that squeak and shriek at intrusion. The guide explained that the god only dwells there twice a year, at which times the space is cleaned and illuminated. Just west of this hall is a large tank, estimated at 200 feet long, used by both men and women for washing. Such tanks are common at temples; Mádura has a beautiful \"golden lotus tank\" with an island pagoda two miles from its temple, used for the Taypúsam festival, and Mylapore also features a handsome tank and pagoda near its temple, though most are within temple precincts.",

        "content": "Entering the inner inclosure at Chidámbaram you come to various arcades and shrines, where Brahmans and chetties raged. The chetties have great influence at Chidámbaram; their caste supplies I believe the main funds of the temple—which is practically therefore in their hands. I was presented with flower garlands and a lime, and expected to make my money-offering in front of a little temple, of Vishnu I think, which they seasonably explained to me was to be roofed with gold! On the other225 hand—to the left—was a temple to Siva—both these forms being worshiped here. Into the shrine of Parvati I did not penetrate, but it looked ancient and curious. Fergusson says that this shrine belongs to the 14th or 15th centuries, and the inner sanctuaries to somewhere about 1000 A.D., while the hall of the thousand columns—which shows Mahomedan influence—is as late as the 17th century. An elderly stoutish man, half naked, but with some authority evidently—who proved afterwards to be the head of the chetties—announced in a loud voice that I was to be treated with respect and shown as much as possible—which only meant that I was to give as large an offering as possible. Then an excited-looking fellow came up, a medium-sized man of about forty, and began talking cockney English as fluently and idiomatically as if he had been born by the Thames, rattling off verses and nursery rhymes with absurd familiarity. The rest said he was a cranky Brahman with an insane gift for language—knew Sanskrit and ever so many tongues. Escaping from these I left the temple and went into the village to see the goldsmiths who are employed (by the chetties) on work connected with its restoration. Found a large workshop where they were making brass roof-pinnacles, salvers, pedestals for images, etc., and plating the same with gold leaf or plates—also store of solid gold things—armlets and breastplates for the gods, etc.—another touch remindful of Greek life. The gold leaf was being beaten out between thin membranes—many leaves at once—with a hammer. All handwork, of course. 226 My guide—who is the station clerk and a Brahman, while his station-master is a Sudra (O this steam-engine!)—told me on the way back that the others at the station often advised him to give up his caste practices; but he had plenty of time in the middle of the day, between the trains, to go through his ablutions and other ceremonies, and he did not see why he should not do so. As we walked along the road we met two pilgrims—with orange-colored cloths—coming along. One of them, a hairy, wild, and obstinate-looking old man, evidently spotted the hated Englishman from afar, and as he passed put his tongue gently but firmly out at me!",
        "target_summary": "Entering the inner enclosure of Chidámbaram temple, the author observed various arcades and shrines, where Brahmans and chetties held significant influence. The chetties were particularly powerful, supplying the main funds and effectively controlling the temple. The author was presented with flower garlands and a lime, then expected to make an offering at a Vishnu temple that was to be roofed with gold. A Siva temple was also present, and the ancient Parvati shrine, though not entered, was noted for its age; Fergusson dated it to the 14th or 15th centuries, the inner sanctuaries to around 1000 A.D., and the Mahomedan-influenced hall of a thousand columns to the 17th century. The head of the chetties, an elderly, half-naked man, loudly proclaimed the author should be treated with respect and shown much, which the author understood as a demand for a substantial offering.

        "content": "ndia beggars description—the interminable races, languages, creeds, colors, manners, costumes. The streets of Madras (Blacktown) are a blaze of color—predominant white, but red, orange, brilliant green and even blue cloths and turbans meet the eye in every direction. Blacktown reminds one of Pompeii—as it may have been in its time—mostly one-storied buildings, stuccoed brick with little colonnades or lean-to thatches in front, cool dark stone interiors with little or no furniture—a bit of a court somewhere inside, with a gleam of the relentless sun—a few mango leaves over the door in honor of the Pongal festival (now going on), and saffron smeared on doorposts; a woman standing half lost in shadow, men squatting idling in a verandah, a brahman cow with a bright brass necklace lying down just in the street—(sometimes in the verandah itself); a Hindu temple with its queer creepy images fronting on the street, and a Juggernath car under a tall thatch, waiting for its festival; or a white arabesqued and gimp-arched mosque with tall minarets pinnacled with gold spiring up into the blue; absurd little stalls with men squatted among their baskets and piled grains228 and fruits; and always this wonderful crowd going up and down between. I should think half the people have religious marks on their foreheads—black, white, or red spots on the frontal sinus—horizontal lines (Saivite), vertical lines (Vaishnavite)—sometimes two vertical white marks joined at the base with a red mark between, sometimes a streak of color all down the ridge of the nose—and so forth. It is as if every little sect or schism of the Christian Church declared itself by a symbol on the brow. How different from Ceylon! There is a certain severity about India, both climate and people. The dry soil, the burning sun (for though so much farther north the sun has a more wicked quality about it here), are matched by a certain aridity and tension in the people. Ceylon is idyllic, romantic—the plentiful foliage and shade everywhere, the easy-going nature of the Cinghalese themselves, the absence of caste—even the English are softened towards such willing subjects. But here, such barriers, such a noli-me-tangere atmosphere!—the latent feud between Hindu and Mussulman everywhere, their combined detestation of the English springing out upon you from faces passing; rigid orthodoxies and superiorities; the Mahomedans (often big and moderately well-conditioned men) looking down with some contempt upon the lean Hindu; the Hindus equally satisfied in their own superiority, comforting themselves with quotations from Shastras and Puranas. As to the boatmen and drivers and guides and servants generally, they torment one like gadflies;229 not swindling one in a nice open riant way like the Italians of the same ilk, but with smothered dodges and obsequious craft. The last hotel I was at here was odious—a lying Indian manager, lying and cringing servants, and an idiotic old man who acted as my “boy” and tormented my life out of me, fiddling around with my slippers on pretence of doing something, or holding the towel in readiness for me while I was washing my face. On my leaving, the manager—as he presented his bill with utmost dignity and grace—asked for a tip; so did the head-waiter, and all the servants down to the bath-man; then there were coolies to carry my luggage from the hotel steps (where the servants of course left it) to the cab, and then when I had started, the proprietor of the cab ran after it, stopped it, and demanded a larger fare than I had agreed to! On one occasion (in taking a boat) I counted eleven people who put in a claim for bakshish. Small change cannot last for ever, and even one’s vocabulary of oaths is liable to be exhausted in time! It requires a little tact to glide through all this without exposing oneself to the enemy. Good old John Bull pays through the nose for being ruler of this country. He overwhelms the people by force, but they turn upon him—as the weaker is prone to do—through craft; and truly they have their revenge. Half believing in the idea that as sahib and ruler of the country he must live in such and such style, have so many servants, etc., or he would lose his prestige, he acquiesces in a system of impositions; he is pestered to death, and hates it all, but he must submit. And the worst is one is conscious all the230 time of being laughed at for one’s pains. But British visitors must not commit the mistake—so commonly made by people in a foreign country—of supposing that the classes created in India by our presence, and who in some sense are the reflection of our own sins, are or represent the normal population—even though we naturally see more of them than we do of the latter. There are however in the great cities of India little hotels kept and frequented by English folk where one is comparatively safe from importunities; and if you are willing to be altogether a second-rate person, and go to these places, travel second class by train, ride in bullock-hackeries, and “undermine the empire” generally by doing other such undignified things, you may travel with both peace of mind and security of pocket.",

Madras's \"Blacktown\" is a vibrant spectacle of color, with people in brilliant red, orange, green, and blue attire contrasting with predominant white buildings. The architecture, reminiscent of Pompeii, features mostly one-storied, stuccoed brick buildings with colonnades or thatched lean-tos, housing cool, dark interiors. Street life is vivid: cows with brass necklaces, Hindu temples with \"queer creepy images,\" mosques with gold-pinnacled minarets, and stalls bustling with vendors. This tableau unfolds amidst a constant, colorful crowd, many bearing distinct religious marks on their foreheads—Saivite (horizontal lines) or Vaishnavite (vertical)—symbolizing various sects, akin to Christian denominations.\n\nThis India contrasts sharply with Ceylon's idyllic nature. India exhibits a \"severity\" in both its climate—with dry soil and a \"wicked\" burning sun—and its people, characterized by an \"aridity and tension.\" In contrast, Ceylon is idyllic and romantic, with abundant foliage, easy-going Cinghalese, and an absence of caste, which even softens the English. India is marked by pervasive social barriers, including a \"latent feud\" between Hindus and Muslims, their shared \"detestation\" of the English, and rigid orthodoxies where each group asserts superiority—Mahomedans often looking down on Hindus, who in turn find satisfaction in their own traditions.\n\nThe narrator finds interaction with local service providers—boatmen, drivers, guides, and servants—exasperating. They are described as \"gadflies\" who \"torment\" with \"obsequious craft\" and \"smothered dodges,\" rather than open swindling, constantly demanding tips (\"bakshish\") and overcharging. The narrator recounts numerous exasperating experiences: a hotel manager and all staff demanding tips, a cab proprietor chasing down the vehicle for an increased fare, and once, eleven individuals claiming \"bakshish\" for a single boat trip. Such relentless demands quickly exhaust both patience and resources.\n\nThe British \"sahib,\" believing they must maintain prestige through a lavish lifestyle and numerous servants, unwittingly acquiesces to a system of impositions. They are \"pestered to death,\" detesting the situation but feeling compelled to submit, often with the humiliating awareness of being laughed at. The author advises British visitors not to mistake these opportunists—a class created by the British presence—for the true Indian population. Instead, by embracing a \"second-rate\" travel style—using simpler English-frequented hotels, second-class trains, and local transport like bullock-hackeries—one can avoid importunities, ensure peace of mind, save money, and, effectively, \"undermine the empire's\" artificial demands.",

        "content": "Madras generally is a most straggling, dull, and (at night) ill-lighted place. Blacktown, already described, and which lies near the harbor, is the chief centre of native life; but the city generally, including other native centres, plexuses of commercial life, knots of European hotels and shops, barracks, hospitals, suburban villas and bungalows, stretches away with great intervals of dreary roads between for miles and miles, over a dead flat on whose shore the surf beats monotonously. Adyar, where the Theosophists have their headquarters—and which is still only a suburb of Madras—is seven miles distant from the harbor. The city however, though shorn of its former importance as far as the British are concerned, and slumbering on its memories231 of a hundred years ago, is a great centre of native activity, literary and political; the National Indian Congress receives some of its strongest support from it; many influential oysters reside here; papers like the Hindu, both in English and vernacular, are published here, and a great number of books printed, in Tamil and other South Indian languages. At Adyar I saw Bertram Keightley and one or two others, and had some pleasant chats with them. Col. Olcott was absent just at the time. The Theosophist villa, with roomy lecture-hall and library, stands pleasantly among woods on the bank of a river and within half a mile of the sea. Passing from the library through sandalwood doors into an inner sanctum I was shown a variety of curios connected with Madame Blavatsky, among which were a portrait, apparently done in a somewhat dashing style—just the head of a man, surrounded with clouds and filaments—in blue pigment on a piece of white silk, which was “precipitated” by Madame Blavatsky in Col. Olcott’s presence—she simply placing her two hands on the white silk for a moment. Keightley told me that Col. Olcott tested a small portion of the silk so colored, but found the pigment so fast in the fibre that it could not by any means be washed out. There were also two oil portraits—heads, well framed and reverently guarded behind a curtain—of the now celebrated Kout Houmi, Madame Blavatsky’s Guru, and of another, Col. Olcott’s Guru—both fine-looking men, apparently between forty and fifty years of age, with shortish beards and (as far as I could see, for the daylight232 was beginning to fail) dark brown hair; and both with large eyes and what might be called a spiritual glow in their faces. Madame Blavatsky knew Col. Olcott’s Guru as well as her own, and the history of these two portraits (as told me by Keightley) is that they were done by a German artist whom she met in the course of her travels. Considering him competent for the work—and he being willing to undertake it—she projected the images of the two Gurus into his mind, and he painted from the mental pictures—she placing her hand on his head during the operation. The German artist medium accounted for the decidedly mawkish expression of both faces, as well as for the considerable likeness to each other—which considering that Kout Houmi dates from Cashmere, and the other (I think) from Thibet, might not have been expected. All the same they are fine faces, and it is not impossible that they may be, as I believe Madame Blavatsky and Col. Olcott considered them, good likenesses. Keightley was evidently much impressed by the “old lady’s” clairvoyant power, saying that sometimes in her letters from England she displayed a knowledge of what was going on at Adyar, which he could not account for. Altogether I had an interesting conversation with him. Among other places in Madras I visited one of the little Pompeiian houses in Blacktown, which I have already described—where a Hindu acquaintance, a small contractor, is living: a little office, then a big room divided in two by a curtain—parlor in front and domestic room behind—all cool and dark and devoid of furniture, and little back premises233 into which I did not come. He is an active-minded man, and very keen about the Indian Congress to which he was delegate last year, sends hundreds of copies of the Hindu and other “incendiary” publications about the country each week, and like thousands and hundreds of thousands of his fellow-countrymen to-day, has learnt the lessons taught him by the British Government so well that the one thing he lives for is to see electoral and representative institutions embedded into the life of the Indian peoples, and the images of Vishnu and Siva supplanted in the temples by those of John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer. While I was there two elderly gentlemen of quite the old school called—innocent enough of Herbert Spencer and of cloth coats and trousers—with their white muslins round their bodies, and red shawls over their shoulders, and grey-haired keen narrow faces and bare shins and horny feet, which they tucked up onto their chairs as they sat; but with good composed unhurried manners, as all Easterns of the old school seem to have. This habit of the mild Hindu, of tucking his feet under him, is his ever-present refuge in time of trouble or weariness; at the railway station or in any public place you may see him sitting on a seat, and beneath him, in the place where his feet ought to be, are his red slippers; but of visible connection between them and his body there is none—as if he had already severed connection with the earth and was on the way toward heaven. Calcutta.—Arrived 6th Feb., about 4 p.m.—steaming all day since dawn up the Hooghly, 130234 miles from the light-boat at its mouth to Calcutta—a dismal river, with dismal flat shores, sandy and dry in places and only grown with scrub, in others apparently damp, to judge by the clumps of bamboo; landscape often like Lincolnshire, trees of similar shape, stacks of rice-straw looking just like our stacks, mud and thatch villages; in other places the palmyra and coco-nut palm; and doubtless in parts wild tangles and jungles haunted by tigers; aboriginal boats going up and down; and the Hooghly narrowing at last from four or five miles near its mouth to half a mile at the Howrah bridge of boats. Nearing Calcutta brick-kilns and the smoky tall chimneys of civilisation appear along the banks, and soon we find ourselves among docks and wharfs, and a forest of shipping alongside of a modern-looking city (that part of it). Calcutta is built on a dead flat. There is a considerable European quarter of five-storied buildings, offices, warehouses, law-courts, hotels, shops, residences, wide streets and open spaces, gardens, etc.; after which the city breaks away into long straggling lines of native dwellings—small flat-roofed tenements and shops, crowded bazaars and tram-lines—embedding almost aboriginal quarters, narrow lanes with mere mud and tile cabins—labyrinths where a European is stared at.",
        "target_summary": "Madras is described as a sprawling, dull, and poorly lit city, stretching for miles across flat terrain with significant distances between areas like Blacktown (the primary native hub), European centers, and suburban villas. Although its importance to the British has waned, Madras thrives as a hub of native literary and political activity, strongly supporting the National Indian Congress, publishing influential papers like the Hindu, and printing numerous books in various South Indian languages.\n\nAt Adyar, seven miles from the harbor, the narrator visited the Theosophical Society headquarters, meeting Bertram Keightley. He explored the pleasant villa, which included a lecture hall and library. In an inner sanctum, he viewed curios related to Madame Blavatsky, including a portrait of a man's head (surrounded by clouds) in blue on silk, which Blavatsky allegedly \"precipitated\" by simply touching the fabric. Col. Olcott had tested the silk, confirming the pigment's permanent fastness. Also displayed were two oil portraits of Blavatsky's Guru, Kout Houmi, and Col. Olcott's Guru—both fine-looking men with spiritual countenances. Keightley explained that Blavatsky had met a German artist and, by placing her hand on his head, projected the Gurus' images into his mind for him to paint. Keightley also affirmed his belief in Blavatsky's clairvoyant abilities, noting her uncanny knowledge of Adyar events from England.\n\nIn Blacktown, the narrator visited a Hindu acquaintance, a small contractor, in his simple, cool, and sparsely furnished Pompeiian-style house. This active-minded individual, a delegate to the Indian Congress, was passionate about promoting electoral and representative institutions in India, even suggesting they should replace traditional religious figures like Vishnu and Siva. During the visit, two elderly gentlemen of the \"old school\" called, dressed in traditional muslins and shawls, embodying composed, unhurried Eastern manners, and characteristically sitting with their feet tucked up.\n\nThe narrator then details his arrival in Calcutta on February 6th, after an all-day, 130-mile journey up the dismal Hooghly River, characterized by flat shores of varied vegetation. As the river narrowed, brick-kilns and chimneys signaled the city's approach, leading to docks and shipping. Calcutta itself is built on flat ground, featuring a significant European quarter with five-storied buildings, wide streets, and gardens. This contrasts sharply with the sprawling, crowded native quarters, comprising small tenements, bustling bazaars, and narrow, maze-like lanes, some described as almost \"aboriginal,\" where Europeans are closely observed.",

        "content": "The white dome of the Post Office, like a small St. Paul’s, dominates the whole riverside city with its crowded shipping and animated quays—fit symbol of modern influences. Round no temple or mosque or minster does the civilising Englishman group his city, but round the G.P.O. It would235 almost seem, here in Calcutta, as if the mere rush of commercial interests had smashed up the native sanctions of race and religion. The orderly rigor of caste, which is evident in Madras, is not seen; dress is untidy and unclean, the religious marks if put on at all are put on carelessly; faces are low in type, lazy, cunning, bent on mere lucre. The Bengali is however by nature a versatile flexile creature, sadly wanting in backbone, and probably has succumbed easily to the new disorganising forces. Then the mere mixture of populations here may have a good deal to do with it. A huge turmoil throngs the bazaars, not only Bengalis, but Hindustanis, Mahomedans, Chinese, and seedy-looking Eurasians—in whom one can discern no organising element or seed-form of patriotism, religion, or culture (with the exception perhaps of the Chinese). It seems to be a case of a dirty Western commercialism in the place of the old pharisaism of caste and religion, and it is hard to say which may be the worst. Sunday (the 8th) was a great day for bathing in the river. I did not know that the Hooghly was for such purposes considered to be a part of the Ganges, but it appears that it is; and owing to an important and rare astronomical conjunction, announced in the almanacs, bathing on that day was specially purificatory. In the morning the waterside was thronged with people, and groups of pilgrims from a distance could be seen coming in along the roads. Wherever the banks shelved down to the water, or the quays and river-walls allowed, huge crowds (here mostly dressed in unbleached236 cotton, with little color) could be seen preparing to bathe, or renewing themselves afterwards—beggars at all the approaches spreading their cloths on the ground to catch the scanty handfuls of rice thrown to them; everywhere squatted, small vendors of flowers for offerings, or of oil, or sandalwood paste for smearing the body with after the bath, or of colored pigments for painting sect-marks on the forehead; strings of peasants followed by their wives and children; old infirm people piloted by sons and daughters; here a little old woman, small like a child, drawn in a clumsy wooden barrow to the waterside; there a horrible blind man with matted hair, squatted, yelling texts from the holy books; here family groups and relatives chatting together, or cliques and clubs of young men coming up out of the water—brass pots glancing, and long hair uncurled in the wind. If you imagine all this taking place on a fine summer’s day somewhere a little below London Bridge, the scene would hardly be more incongruous than it is here by the handsome wharfs of Calcutta Strand, under the very noses of the great black-hulled steamships which to-day perhaps or to-morrow are sailing for the West. The evening before the festival I went with Panna Lall B. to a European circus which happened to be in the place—same absurd incongruity—dense masses of “oysters” perched or sitting cross-legged on their benches—their wraps drawn round them, for the night was really cold—watching under the electric light the lovely and decidedly well-developed Miss Alexandra in tights performing on the trapeze, or little “Minnie” jumping through rings of flame.237 Considering that, except among the poorest classes (peasants, etc.), the Bengalis keep their women closely shut up, and that it is a rare thing to see a female (unless it be a child or old woman) in the streets of Calcutta—a scene of this kind at the circus must cause a sufficient sensation; and indeed the smile which curled the lips of some of these rather Mephistophelean spectators was something which I shall not easily forget. But the mass of the people of India must be wretchedly poor. These half-starved peasants from the surrounding country wandering about—their thin thin wives and daughters trailing after them, holding on to the man’s unbleached and scanty cotton cloth—over the maidan, through the Asiatic Museum, through the streets, by the riverside—with gaping yet listless faces—are a sad and touching sight; yet it only corroborates what I have seen in other parts. “Wide and deepening poverty all over the land, such as the world has never before seen on so vast a scale,” says Digby; and with some testimony to show that the people in the native states are in a better condition than those under our organisation. Even if the poverty is not increasing (and this is a matter on which it is most difficult to form a definite opinion), there seems to be no evidence to show that it is decreasing. The famines go on with at least undiminished severity, and the widespread agricultural paralysis is by no means really compensated by a fallacious commercial prosperity, which in the larger centres is enriching the few at the expense of the many. After watching these pathetic crowds on Sunday,238 I went the next day to a meeting of the Countess of Dufferin’s Fund for the Medical Education of Indian Women—a well-meant movement, which after being launched with all advantages and éclat has only met with moderate success. A very varied spectacle of dress and nationality. Rajahs and native chiefs of all sorts of hues and costumes; yellow silk tunics figured with flowers, flowing purple robes, dainty little turbans over dark mustachioed faces, sprays and feathers of diamonds; English ladies in the pink of fashion, military uniforms, and the Viceroy and Lady Lansdowne in the centre in quiet morning costume. The English speakers belauded the native chiefs present, and the native chiefs complimented the English ladies; but after the spectacle of the day before the general congratulations fell rather flat upon me, nor did they appear to be justified by the rather melancholy and inefficient appearance of the bevy of native women students and nurses present. Sir Chas. Elliott, the Lieut.-Governor, made a kindly speech, which left on one the unpleasant impression that one sometimes gets from those big-brained doctrinaire persons whose amiability is all the more hard and narrow-minded because it is so well-intentioned. Lord Lansdowne underneath an exterior (physical and mental) of decadent aristocracy seems to have just a spark of the old English high-caste ruling quality about him—which was certainly good in its time, but will be of little use I fear to the half-starved peasants of to-day.",
        "target_summary": "The white-domed Post Office, likened to a small St. Paul's, symbolizes Calcutta's modern commercial influences, which the author suggests have \"smashed up the native sanctions of race and religion.\" Unlike Madras, the city lacks the orderly rigor of caste; its population is described as untidy, unclean, and driven by \"mere lucre,\" with \"low in type, lazy, cunning\" faces. Bengalis, seen as versatile but \"sadly wanting in backbone,\" are believed to have easily succumbed to these new disorganizing forces. The city's \"huge turmoil\" of diverse populations—including Hindustanis, Mahomedans, Chinese, and \"seedy-looking Eurasians\" who exhibit no \"organising element\" of culture—results in what the author calls \"dirty Western commercialism\" replacing the \"old pharisaism of caste and religion,\" an outcome he finds difficult to judge as better or worse.\n\nA significant Sunday bathing festival in the Hooghly River, considered part of the Ganges, drew immense crowds due to a rare and important astronomical conjunction, making bathing specially purificatory. The waterside was thronged with people and distant pilgrims in \"unbleached cotton,\" preparing to bathe or renewing themselves. Beggars spread cloths for rice offerings, while vendors sold flowers, oil, or sandalwood paste. The scene was rich with specific details: strings of peasants with families, old infirm people, a \"little old woman...drawn in a clumsy wooden barrow,\" and a \"horrible blind man...yelling texts.\" This ancient, vibrant ritual unfolded incongruously against Calcutta's \"handsome wharfs,\" under the very noses of \"great black-hulled steamships\" bound for the West.\n\nThe evening prior, the author attended a European circus, noting the \"absurd incongruity\" of \"dense masses of 'oysters'\" (Bengali men) watching under electric light as \"the lovely and decidedly well-developed Miss Alexandra\" performed.

        "content": "I fancy, with all respect to the genuine good intention shown in these zenana missions, medical239 education funds, etc., there must be something rather comical to the natives themselves in philanthropic efforts of this kind, made by a people who understand the country so little as the English do; just as there is something rather comical to the masses at home in the toy “charities” and missions of the lady and gentleman here, and suggestive of an old parable about a mote and a beam. In a lecture given by the Maharajah of Benares, in July, 1888, he chaffed these philanthropists somewhat—recounting how one such lady “actually regretted that the peasant cultivators could not provide themselves with boots! while another had a long conversation with a Rani on the ill effects of infant marriage, and was surprised to hear that the Rani had been married at the age of seven, and had sons and grandsons, all of whom were happy and contented. The Rani then turned to the lady, and observing that her hair was turning grey, inquired whether no one had ever offered her proposals of marriage, and suggested that the English laws required some modification to insure ladies against remaining so long in a state of single blessedness.” But the most interesting people, to me, whom I have met here, are a little côterie of Bengalis who live quite away in the native part of the city. Chundi Churn B. is a schoolmaster, and keeps a small school of thirty or forty boys, which lies back in a tangle of narrow lanes and alleys, but is quite a civilised little place with benches and desks just like an English school—except that like all the schools in this part of the world it is quite open to the street (with trellised sides in this case), so that240 passers-by can quite easily see and be seen. Chundi Churn told me that he started the school on purely native lines, but had poor success until he introduced the English curriculum—English history, science, Euclid, Algebra, etc.—when he soon got as many boys as he wanted. As in all the Indian schools they work what appear to us frightfully long hours, 7–9 a.m.; then an hour for breakfast; 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and then an hour for dinner; and again from 3 till 6. I fancy they must take it fairly easy; and then it is certain that the native boys—though they have active little brains—are much more quiescent than the English, are content to sit still, and the master has little trouble in keeping order. I have been round several evenings after school241 hours and chatted with Chundi Churn and his brother and various friends that dropped in—an intelligent little community. Two of them are Brahman fellows of about thirty, with the eager tense look that the Brahmans mostly have, but good imaginative faces. We discuss the Indian Congress, English and Indian customs, the child-marriage question (which is raging just now), and the great question of Caste. They insist on my eating various sweet cakes of native preparation, but will not eat with me; and they smoke hubble-bubble pipes, which they pass round—but the Brahmans must have a hubble-bubble to themselves! At the same time they are careful to explain that “no one believes in all this now”; but as they are at home, and only trellis-work between us and the lane, it would not do to violate the rules. And this, I believe, is largely the state of affairs. The anglicising population, for the sake of parents’ feelings (and they are tender on this point), or respectability, or commercial connection, keep up a show of caste rules which they have ceased or are ceasing to believe in; and it is an open secret that Brahman gentlemen of high standing in their caste, not unfrequently when traveling, or in places where they are not known, resort to British hotels and have a high feed of beefsteaks and champagne! One of the Brahmans is clerk in a mercantile establishment in the English part of Calcutta, and some of the others are students at the Metropolitan College. Western education is going on at a tremendous rate—so much so that there will soon be an educated proletariat (what Grant Duff calls “the worst242 of evils”) in the great cities of India. Two or three of the party are very quick at mathematics—which seems to be a subject in which the Bengalis excel—and readily picked up the key to one or two little problems which I presented to them. They all seem to be much impressed with the greatness of Western civilisation—for the present at any rate, but will react probably before so very long. Finding I knew something of astronomy they pelted me with questions about the stars, and insisted on going out at night and trying to hunt up the ecliptic among the constellations! Then after a time they would relapse into tale-telling and music. The fellows still show a truly Oriental love of long stories, and would listen with rapt attention to one of their party relating some ancient yarn about the child of a king who was exposed in the woods and ultimately came back after many convolutions of adventure and claimed his kingdom—just as if they had not heard it before; or about the chaste Draupatha (in the Mahabhárata) who—when Duriyodhana, desiring to insult her before a large assembly, gave orders that she should be stripped of her cloth—thought of Vishnu, and her cloth went on lengthening and unwinding indefinitely—their stories lengthening and unwinding like Draupatha’s cloth, in a way that would have delighted the heart of William Morris.",
        "target_summary": "The author suggests that British philanthropic efforts in India, such as zenana missions and medical funds, likely appear comical and ill-informed to the natives due to a profound lack of cultural understanding, akin to the \"mote and beam\" parable. The Maharajah of Benares playfully highlighted this, noting a lady's concern for peasants lacking boots, and another's surprise at a Rani happily married at seven, leading the Rani to humorously inquire about the lady's single status and English laws.\n\nThe narrative shifts to an intelligent Bengali community in the native city, focusing on Chundi Churn B., a schoolmaster. His small school, initially unsuccessful with a native curriculum, flourished after adopting English subjects like history, science, Euclid, and Algebra. Students work exceptionally long hours but are generally quiescent and well-behaved.\n\nDuring discussions with this group, which includes Brahmans, a mercantile clerk, and college students, on topics like the Indian Congress, child marriage, and caste, the author notes their adherence to caste rules (e.g., separate smoking, not eating with him). However, they explain these practices are maintained for social appearance, family feelings, or respectability, as they personally no longer believe in them. It is an \"open secret\" that high-caste Brahmans often disregard these rules, such as eating beefsteaks and champagne, when traveling.\n\nWestern education is rapidly advancing, with a concern for an \"educated proletariat\" emerging. The Bengalis demonstrate strong mathematical aptitude and a current appreciation for Western civilization, showing keen interest in astronomy. Despite this, they also retain a deep affection for traditional long stories and music, showcasing a blend of modern influences and enduring cultural heritage.",

        "content": "Panna Lall, Chundi Churn’s brother, is a bright-mannered youth of about twenty, of a modest affectionate disposition, and with a certain grace and dignity of bearing. He doesn’t care about books, but has a good ear and plays one or two musical instruments in an easy unstudied way; lives in quite243 primitive style with his father down in one of these back lanes—but has a tiny little room of his own where he takes me to sit and chat with friends. There is no furniture, but you squat cross-legged on the floor—so there is plenty of room for quite a party. There may be a box or two in a corner, and on the walls some shelves and a few prints. Indeed it gives one a curious sensation to see crude colored woodcuts, framed under glass and exactly resembling the pictures of the Virgin or of Christ common in Catholic countries, and then on nearer approach to find that they represent Siva or Parvati, or among the Bengalis Chaitanya, or some other incarnation of the divinity, standing or seated on a lotus flower244 and with benign head encircled by an aureole. These pictures are printed in Calcutta. Panna Lall is quite an athlete, and interested in anything in that line. He took me one day to a little bit of ground where he and some friends have their horizontal bars, etc.; they did some good tumbling and tight-rope walking, and with their golden-brown skins and muscular bodies looked well when stripped. The Bengali Babu is often of a lightish-brown colour. The people generally wear more clothing than in South India, and at this time of year throw a brown woollen shawl over their shoulders, toga fashion; their heads are almost always bare, but they have taken a great fancy lately in Calcutta to wearing narrow-toed patent-leather shoes, which look sufficiently absurd and must be fearfully uncomfortable on their well-developed broad feet. Only it is a mark of distinction and civilisation! Panna Lall every now and then, when walking, entreats me to stop and rest under a tree, and then takes off his shoes and waggles his toes about to soothe and refresh them! I am never tired of admiring the foot in its native state. It is so broad and free and full and muscular, with a good concave curve on the inner line, and the toes standing well apart from each other—so different from the ill-nourished unsightly thing we are accustomed to. I sometimes think we can never attain to a broad free and full life on our present understandings in the West. Another absurd custom of the young Babus here (I am speaking of the mass of the people) is that of putting on a Manchester cotton shirt, pure and245 simple, when they wish to appear in full dress! As they do not wear trousers, the effect (combined with the patent-leather shoes) is very naïve and touching. On the whole Calcutta does not impress me very favorably. There is the official society, and the trading and commercial ditto, and the educational and legal sections, and a considerable racing population, including a great number of jockeys and horse-trainers who come over with their girls from Australia for the season; there-is a fine zoological garden and a botanic garden, and the Asiatic Museum, and various public buildings, and two or three colleges, including a college for native women; but all these interests seem to serve chiefly in the direction of disorganizing the mass of the people and the primitive sanctions of their life. Taking it at its worst the general population is dirty, lazy and rapacious. As in our slums, a kind of listlessness and despair marks the people in the poorest quarters—who, instead of congregating as with us round a beershop, may be seen perching about on doorsteps and even on the tops of walls, sitting on their heels with knees drawn up to the chin, and a draggled garment about them—looking painfully like vultures, and generally chewing betel, that common resource against hunger. One notes however, even here, a few fine faces, and a good many very pathetic ones, of old people. Chundi Churn plays a little on the sítar—the original of our guitar I suppose—an instrument with a long neck and small belly made of a pumpkin shell, and four or five wires (originally three wires,246 from si, three, and tar, string). The frets are movable, so that keeping the same key-note you can play in major, minor, or other modes. I am beginning to understand the Indian music better now, after having heard a little in different places; but have not very much systematic knowledge about it. It appears that they divide the octave into twenty-two exactly equal parts, called sruti—each part having its own special name. An interval of four srutis may then be said to constitute a major tone, three srutis a minor tone, and two a semitone—though this is not quite exact; and out of these three intervals, major tone, minor tone, and semitone, a seven-step scale is constituted very nearly similar to ours, and having the semitones in the same places. The key-note of this scale is called Sa or Ansa, and corresponds to our Do, and though not exactly a key-note in the modern sense of the word, it is the most accentuated note and “rules the others.” By adopting any of the other six notes as key-note scales are got very nearly corresponding to the seven Gregorian scales of the old church music; and one very commonly in use, if I am not mistaken, corresponds to the Phrygian mode—i.e. that which we produce on the piano by using E as tonic and playing all the white keys. These seven scales constituted the first system of Hindu music; but they had a second system in which the notes, though preserving their names, could be, any of them, raised or dropped by a sruti; and a third system in which one or two notes being omitted, five or six-step scales were produced. Out of the hundreds (or thousands) of possible247 scales thus producible, the Oriental mind, unable to find the scientific root of the whole business, made a fantastic selection. There were six sons of Brahma and Saráswati called Rágas—the genii of the passions. Six principal scales were named after these genii and called Rags, and then each of these had five feminine sub-scales or Raginas attached to it; and so forth. Then the numbers five, six and seven became typical of divisions of the year, days of the week, the number of planets, etc., and very soon a most fanciful system was elaborated—the remains only of which have lingered to the present day. The old notation appears to have died out; but a vast number of time-honored melodies, or rather phrases, in the different modes and scales, have been preserved by tradition—and are now called rags and raginas, though these names were formerly applicable to the scales only. These rags and raginas are not what we should call tunes, but are brief or extended phrases, which have been classified as suitable for various occasions, emotions, festivals, times of day, seasons of the year, and the like; and these the musician uses and combines, within limits, to his taste; and in the hands of a skilful person they are very effective, but become abominably insipid and conventional if treated in a mechanical way. Besides the regular notes belonging to any given scale, the Hindus use the quarter tones, or srutis, a good deal in the little turns and twanks of which they are so fond; and sometimes by slurring they pass through every intermediate gradation of tone. The slur, which is congenial to the mystic vague melody of the East, and so foreign to the distinct248 articulation of Western music, is often used in singing; and on the sítar a slight slurring rise of tone is produced by drawing the string sideways along the fret—a device which recalls the clavichord of which Sebastian Bach was so fond, in which instrument the hammer which struck the string was also the bridge which defined its length, so that an increased pressure by the finger on the key after the first striking of the note raised the bridge a little, tightened the string, and so produced a plaintive rise of tone.",
        "target_summary": "Panna Lall, Chundi Churn’s bright-mannered and modest twenty-year-old brother, possesses a graceful bearing. He has a natural musical talent, playing instruments with ease despite not caring for books. He lives simply with his father in a back lane, but has a small, unfurnished private room where friends gather, sitting cross-legged on the floor amidst a few boxes, shelves, and prints. The room displays curious Calcutta-printed woodcuts, which, though resembling Catholic images of Christ or the Virgin, depict Hindu deities like Siva, Parvati, or Chaitanya on lotus flowers with aureoles.\n\nPanna Lall is also an athlete, demonstrating tumbling and tight-rope walking with friends at their makeshift outdoor gym. The author observes that Bengali Babus typically have a lightish-brown complexion and muscular builds. People generally wear more clothing than in South India, often donning a brown woollen shawl \"toga fashion,\" with heads usually bare. However, a recent Calcutta fashion trend involves narrow-toed patent-leather shoes, which the author finds absurd and uncomfortable on their broad feet, yet they are seen as a mark of distinction. Panna Lall frequently removes his for comfort, leading the author to admire the natural, broad, muscular form of the native foot, contrasting it with the \"ill-nourished unsightly thing\" common in the West. Another \"absurd\" fashion among young Babus is wearing a plain Manchester cotton shirt as formal attire without trousers, creating a \"naïve and touching\" look when combined with the patent-leather shoes.\n\nThe author's overall impression of Calcutta is unfavorable. While acknowledging various societal strata (official, commercial, educational, legal, and a significant racing community) and institutions (zoological and botanic gardens, Asiatic Museum, colleges, including one for native women), these seem to \"disorganize\" the general populace and their traditional ways. The poorer population is described as dirty, lazy, and rapacious, marked by a listlessness and despair similar to Western slums. They are often seen perched on doorsteps or walls, knees drawn to chin, looking \"vulture-like\" and chewing betel, though some fine and pathetic old faces are noted.\n\nChundi Churn plays the sitar, an instrument with a long neck, a pumpkin-shell body, and four or five wires, featuring movable frets that allow playing in various modes. The author is gaining a better understanding of Indian music, noting the octave's division into twenty-two equal *srutis*, each named. A major tone is roughly four *srutis*, a minor tone three, and a semitone two, from which a seven-step scale similar to Western scales is formed, with \"Sa\" or \"Ansa\" as the key-note, analogous to \"Do.\" Using other notes as key-notes yields scales resembling Gregorian modes, with the Phrygian mode being common.\n\nHistorically, Hindu music had several systems: a first with these seven scales; a second allowing notes to be raised or lowered by a *sruti*; and a third with five or six-step scales by omitting notes. The author notes that from hundreds of possibilities, the \"Oriental mind\" made a \"fantastic selection\" without a \"scientific root.\" Six principal scales, called Rags, were named after the \"genii of the passions,\" Ragas (sons of Brahma and Saraswati), each having five \"feminine sub-scales\" or Raginas. This evolved into an elaborate system linked to numbers representing divisions of the year, days, and planets, with only remnants surviving today.\n\nThe ancient notation is lost, but numerous traditional melodies or phrases, now called Rags and Raginas (though these names originally referred to scales), persist. These are not \"tunes\" but brief or extended phrases categorized for specific occasions, emotions, festivals, times of day, or seasons. Musicians combine them artfully, creating effective music, but it becomes \"insipid\" if mechanically performed. Indian music frequently incorporates quarter tones (*srutis*) in its melodic \"turns and twanks,\" and slurring, passing through intermediate gradations of tone. This slurring, congenial to the \"mystic vague melody of the East,\" is distinct from Western music's \"articulation.\" On the sitar, a slurred rise in tone is achieved by drawing the string sideways along the fret, reminiscent of the clavichord, where finger pressure on the key raised the bridge, tightening the string for a plaintive tone.",

        "content": "All this gives the idea of a complicated system of music; and it will be seen that in the range of mere melody the Hindu music has really a greater capacity249 of subtle expression than ours. But in harmony it is deficient—the ground idea of their harmony being the use of a drone bass—which bass, though it may change not unfrequently, always seems to preserve the drone character. And of course the deficiency in harmony reacts on and limits the play of melody. The general character of the music, like that of much of the Indian life, reminds one of our own mediæval times. The monkish plain-song and the early minstrel music of Europe were probably very similar to this. There was the same tendency to work from a droning bass rather than from a key-note in our sense of the word, the same tendency to subordinate the music to the words, causing vague and not always balanced flights of intricate melody, the same love of ornamental kinks, and the same want of absolute definition in the matter of time. The instruments most commonly used, besides the Sítar and its relative the Vina, are the Manda, a horizontal harp somewhat resembling the Tyrolese zither; the Sigara, a small clarinet; a bamboo flageolet, which has a very sweet and mellow tone; the Tabala, a small kettledrum; and the Taus, a four-stringed fiddle played with a bow. This last is a very curious instrument. Beneath the four main strings are stretched a number of other fine wires, which by their vibration lightly reinforce and sustain the notes played. The effect when not played too fast is very graceful and clinging, with subtle harmonics; and I have heard some most bewitching phrasing on this instrument—a dialogue one might say between it and the voice—with accompaniment250 of the little Tabala. The Tabala itself is very charming, with its gurgling and bell-like sounds and sudden explosions and chattering accompaniments, executed by the fingers and the butt end of the hand on two drums simultaneously. The great effect of the sítar, whose tone on the whole is thin, is undoubtedly the side tension of the strings, which gives much expression to it. At its best the Indian music seems to me to produce a powerful impression—though generally either plaintive or frenzied. On the deep background of the drone are wrought these (Wagnerian) phrases, which are perfectly fluent and variable according to the subject conveyed, which are extraordinarily subtle in expression, and which generally rise in intensity and complexity as the piece progresses, till the hearers are worked into a state of cumulated excitement. When there are several instruments and voices thus figuring together over the same bass, the effect is fine. The little tambours with their gurgling notes record the time in a kind of unconscious way and keep the musicians together. The big drums and the lower strings of the vina give the required basses, the taus and sítars and voices fly up and down in delightful intricacy, quarter notes touched here and there create a plaintive discord, and even the slur judiciously used adds a weird effect as of the wind in the forest. When not at its very best however it is certainly (to me) damnably rambling, monotonous and wearisome—notwithstanding chromatic effects of admitted elegance and occasional passages of great tenderness. What the music most seems to want is251 distinct form and contrast, and the ruder rockier elements—nor is their time-system sufficiently developed to allow change of accent in successive bars, etc. They all say however that the art is not cultivated to-day, and indeed is greatly decadent and to some extent actually lost. Like all branches of learning in India, and the caste-system itself, it has been subject to intense pedantry and formalism, and has become nearly stifled amid the otiose rules which cumber it. On the other hand it is interesting to find that the Hindus call our music not only monotonous (as we call theirs, and which may be accounted for by mere unfamiliarity—as a town-bred man thinks all sheep alike), but also coarse and rude—by which I fancy they mean that our intervals are all very obvious and commonplace, and the time-system rigid—while probably our sequences of harmony are lost upon them. Panna Lall, I find, picks up our tunes quite easily; and seems to like them fairly, but always adds a lot of little kinks and twanks of his own. After all, though the vaguely-floating subtle recitative style of the Indian music has its drawbacks and makes one crave for a little more definition and articulateness, it presses upon one as possible that our music might gain something by the adoption and incorporation of some of these more subtle Eastern elements—if only at times, and as an enhancement of our range of expression by contrast with our own generic style.",
        "target_summary": "Hindu music possesses a greater capacity for subtle melodic expression than Western music but is deficient in harmony, primarily relying on a drone bass that consequently limits melodic freedom. Its character evokes European medieval music, sharing a drone-based approach, subordination to words, intricate and ornamental melodic lines, and an imprecise sense of time.\n\nKey instruments include the Sítar, Vina, Manda (a horizontal harp), Sigara (a small clarinet), a sweet-toned bamboo flageolet, the Tabala (a small kettledrum producing gurgling and bell-like sounds), and the Taus, a four-stringed fiddle featuring sympathetic strings that gracefully reinforce notes. The Sítar's side tension greatly contributes to its expression.\n\nAt its best, Indian music is powerfully impressive, often plaintive or frenzied. Subtle, fluent phrases are woven over the drone background, increasing in intensity and complexity to culminate in listener excitement. The combined effect of multiple instruments and voices—with tambours marking time, drums and vinas providing bass, and taus, sítars, and voices creating intricate lines, enhanced by quarter notes and judicious slurs—is described as fine.\n\nHowever, when not exceptional, the music can be rambling, monotonous, and wearisome, lacking distinct form, contrast, and a developed time-system for varied accents. The art is considered decadent, stifled by pedantry and rigid rules, with some aspects even lost. Conversely, Hindus find Western music monotonous, coarse, and rude, perceiving our intervals as obvious and our time system rigid, while likely not appreciating our harmonies. Despite the occasionally vague nature of Indian music, the author suggests Western music could benefit by adopting some of its subtle Eastern elements to enhance its expressive range.",

All the way from Calcutta to Delhi (and beyond) this immense plain, absolutely flat, spreads in every direction, as far as eye can see the same, dotted park-like with trees (mangos many of them), which thickening here and there into a clump of palmyra palms indicate the presence of a village. The long stretches of bare land with hardly a blade of grass, shimmering in the noonday heat; oases of barley and dhol (a shrub-like lentil) looking green at this time of year, but soon to be reaped and stowed away; patches of potatos, castor-oil plant, poppy in white flower, small guava trees, indigo, etc.; here and there a muddy pool or irrigation channel; a herd of slow ungainly buffalos or the more elegant humped cow’s, browsing miraculously on invisible herbage; a woman following them, barefoot and barehead, singing a sad-toned refrain, picking up the precious253 dung (for fuel) and storing it in a basket; long expanses of mere sand with a few scrubby trees, brown crop-lands without a crop, straggling natural roads or tracks going to the horizon—not a hedge for hundreds of miles—strings of peasants passing from distant village to village, donkeys laden with produce, and now and then a great solid-wheeled cart labouring and creaking by over the unbroken land. The villages themselves are mostly mere collections of mud huts, looking when partially broken down very like anthills; and some villages are surrounded by rude mud walls dating from older and less settled times, and having a very primitive appearance. The people on the whole (after Southern India) look rather dirty in their unbleached cotton, but here and there one meets with bright colors and animated scenes. Here are two peasants drawing water all day from the well to irrigate their rice-field; one guides the bucket down to the water, the other runs out on the long lever arm of a horizontal pole—holding on to the branches of a neighboring tree as he does so—and so brings the bucket up again. And thus they continue from earliest dawn to latest dusk, with a few hours’ rest at midday. Here is one watering his fields by hand, carrying pots and emptying them over the thirsty plants—a fearful toil! Here again is the classical picture—the two mild-eyed cows harnessed at the well mouth. The rope passes over a pulley and draws up a huge skin full of water as the cows recede from the well; then, as they remount the slight slope, the skin again falls254 to the water. To and fro go the cows; one man guides them, another empties the skins into the water channel; and so day-long the work continues. But out on the great plain you may go for hundreds of miles, and mark but little change or variation. Flocks of green parrots, or of pigeons, fly by, or lesser birds; kites perpetually wheel and float overhead; occasionally you may see an antelope or two among the wilder scrub, or a peahen and her little family; the great cloudless blue (though not by any means always cloudless) arches over to the complete circle of the horizon, the whole land trembles in the heat, a light breeze shivers and whispers in the foliage, the sun burns down, and silence (except for the occasional chatter of the parrots or the plaintive song of the peasant) reigns over the vast demesne. In many of these villages the face of a white man is seldom or never seen. Even such centres as Allahabad are mere specks in an ocean; the railway is a slender line of civilisation whose influence hardly extends beyond the sound of the locomotive whistle; over the northern borders of the plain the great snows of the Himalayas dawn into sight and fade away again mornings and evenings, and through its midst wind the slow broad-bosomed waters of the sacred Ganges.",
        "target_summary": "The vast Ganges plains, stretching roughly a thousand miles long and 200-300 miles wide, are impressive for their sheer scale, dense population, and ancient village life, all perpetually dominated by the immense powers of sun and sky. From Calcutta to Delhi and beyond, this absolutely flat expanse spreads uniformly in every direction, dotted park-like with trees, primarily mangoes, which thicken into palmyra palm groves to indicate the presence of villages.\n\nThe landscape features long stretches of bare land shimmering in the noonday heat, alongside green oases of barley and dhol (a shrub-like lentil) flourishing before harvest. Patches of potatoes, castor-oil plants, white-flowered poppies, small guava trees, and indigo add variety, often near muddy pools or irrigation channels. Herds of slow, ungainly buffalos or more elegant humped cows miraculously browse on unseen herbage, sometimes followed by barefoot, bareheaded women singing sad refrains as they collect precious dung for fuel. Vast expanses of sand, brown croplands without crops, and natural tracks stretch to the horizon, unbroken by hedges, traversed by peasants, donkeys laden with produce, and slow, creaking, solid-wheeled carts.\n\nVillages largely consist of simple mud huts, some resembling anthills, and others surrounded by primitive mud walls from older, less settled times. While the people, often in unbleached cotton, can appear dirty, glimpses of bright colors and animated scenes emerge. Rural life is characterized by ceaseless toil, vividly illustrated by peasants drawing water all day from wells to irrigate fields. One method involves two men: one guides a bucket down, while the other runs out on a long lever arm, holding a tree for balance, to raise it. Another form of labor sees a person watering fields by hand, carrying and emptying pots over thirsty plants. The classical image features two mild-eyed cows harnessed at a well mouth; as they recede, a huge skin of water is drawn up via a pulley, then falls back as they remount a slight slope. This continuous rhythm, guided by one man and emptied by another into water channels, endures from earliest dawn to latest dusk.\n\nAcross hundreds of miles, the great plain presents little variation. Flocks of green parrots or pigeons fly by, kites perpetually wheel overhead, and occasionally antelopes or peahens appear in wilder scrub. The immense, often cloudless blue sky arches over the complete horizon, the land trembles in the heat, a light breeze whispers in the foliage, and the sun burns down, with silence prevailing save for birds or peasant songs. These villages are profoundly isolated; a white man's face is rarely seen, and even centers like Allahabad are mere specks. The railway, a slender line of civilization, exerts influence hardly beyond its whistle's sound. Yet, the plains are magnificently framed by the distant, snow-capped Himalayas in the north and traversed by the slow, broad-bosomed waters of the sacred Ganges.",

        "content": "Over all this region, when night comes, floats a sense of unspeakable relief. The spirit—compressed during the day in painful self-defence against the burning sun above and the blinding glare below—expands in grateful joy. A faint odor is wafted from the reviving herbage. The flat earth—which255 was a mere horizon line in the midday light—now fades into nothingness; the immense and mystic sky, hanging over on every side like a veil, opens back into myriads and myriads of stars—and it requires but little imagination to think that this planet is only an atom in the vast dome of heaven. To the Hindu, Life is that blinding sun, that fever of desire and discomfort, and night is the blessed escape, the liberation of the spirit—its grateful passage into Nirwana and the universal. One understands (or thinks one does) how these immense plains have contributed to the speculative character of the Hindu mind. Mountains and broken ground call out energy and invention, but here there is no call upon one to leave the place where one is, or to change one’s habits of life, for the adjoining hundreds of miles present nothing new. Custom undisturbed consolidates itself; society crystallises into caste. The problem of external life once solved presents no more interest, and mechanical invention slumbers; the mind retires inward to meditate and to conquer. Hence two developments—in the best types that of the transcendental faculties, but in the worst mere outer sluggishness and lethargy. The great idea of Indifference belongs to these flat lands—in its highest form one of the most precious possessions of the human soul, in its lowest nothing better than apathy. The peasant too in these plains has for several months nothing to do. He sows his crop, waters it, and reaps it; works hard, and in a few months the rich land rewards him with a year’s subsistence; but he can do no more; the hot weather comes, and256 the green things are burnt up; agriculture ceases, and there remains nothing but to worship the gods. Hence from February to the end of May is the great time for religious festivals, marriages, and ceremonies and frolics of all kinds. That the Ganges should be sacred, and even an object of worship, is easily intelligible—not only on account of its fertilising beneficence to the land, but there is something impressive in its very appearance: its absolute tranquillity and oceanic character as it flows, from half a mile to a mile wide, slowly, almost imperceptibly, onward through the vast hot plain. The water is greenish, not too clear, charged even in the lower portions of its course with the fine mud brought from the mountains; the banks are formed by sandy flats or low cliffs cut in the alluvial soil. As you stand by the water’s edge you sometimes in the straighter reaches catch that effect—which belongs to such rivers in flat countries—of flowing broad and tranquil up to and over the very horizon—an effect which is much increased by the shimmer of heat over the surface. In the Mahabhárata Siva is god of the Himalaya range—or rather he is the Himalayas—its icy crags his brow, its forests his hair. Ganga, the beautiful Ganga, could not descend to earth till Siva consented to receive her upon his head. So impetuously then did she rush down (in rain) that the god grew angry and locked up her floods amid his labyrinthine hair—till at last he let them escape and find their way to the plains. The worship of Siva is very old—was there perhaps when the ancestors of the Brahmans first found their way into these plains—though257 we do not hear of it till about 300 B.C.—one of those far-back Nature worships in which the phenomena of earth and sky are so strangely and poetically interwoven with the deepest intimations of the human soul. On the banks of the Ganges, in the midst of the great plain, stands Benares, one of the most ancient cities of India, and the most sacred resort of Northern Hinduism. Hither come pilgrims by the hundred and the thousand all the year round, to bathe in the Ganges, to burn the bodies of their friends or cast their ashes in the stream, and to make their offerings at the 5,000 shrines which are said to exist in the city. Outside the town along the river-side and in open spots may be seen the tents of pilgrims, and camels tethered. The city itself stands on the slightest rising ground—hardly to be called a hill—and the river banks, here higher than usual, are broken and built into innumerable terraces, stairs, temples, and shrines. The scene is exceedingly picturesque, especially as seen from the river; and though taken in detail the city contains little that is effective in the way of architecture—the shrines and temples being mostly quite small, the streets narrow, and the area of the place circumscribed considering its large population—yet it is the most characteristic and interesting town of India that I have hitherto seen. The English make no show here—there are no residents, no hotels—the English quarter is four miles off, the names of the streets are not written in English characters, and you hardly see a shop sign in the same. And I must say the result of all258 this is very favorable. The sense of organic life that you immediately experience is very marked in contrast to a mongrel city like Calcutta. As you thread the narrow alleys, along which no vehicle can pass, with houses three or four storeys high forming a close lane above you, balconies and upper floors projecting in picturesque confusion not unlike the old Italian towns, you feel that the vari-colored crowd through which you elbow your way is animated by its own distinct standards and ideals. A manifold ancient industry little disturbed by modern invention is going on in the tiny shops on either hand—workshops and saleshops in one. Here is a street full of brass-workers. The elegant brass pots which the whole population uses—for holding or carrying water or oil, for pouring water over the head in bathing, for offering libations in the temples, and so forth—and which form such a feature of Indian folk-life—are here being made, from miniature sizes up to huge vessels holding several gallons. Then there are little brass images, saucers to carry flowers in, and other fancy ware of the same kind. Another street is full of sandal and leather workers; another of sweetmeat or sweet-cake confectioners; another is given to the sale of woollen and cotton wraps—which are mostly commercial products of the West; stone and marble effigies, and gems, form another branch of industry; and cookshops—innocent fortunately of the smell of meat—of course abound. There are many fine faces, both old and young, but especially old—grave peaceful penetrative faces—and among the better259 types of young men some composed, affectionate, and even spiritual faces—withal plenty of mere greed and greasy worldliness.",

The flat earth disappears into a vast, star-filled sky, making one feel like an atom in the universe. For Hindus, life is the day's discomfort, while night represents a blessed escape and liberation into Nirwana. The unchanging nature of these immense plains is believed to have shaped the Hindu mind: with no external call for action or change, customs solidified, society crystallized into caste, and mechanical invention languished. Instead, minds turned inward for meditation and conquest, leading to transcendental thought in the best, but mere sluggishness in the worst, and fostering the concept of \"Indifference\"—either a precious spiritual possession or simple apathy.\n\nDuring the hot months, from February to May, after the brief agricultural cycle of sowing, watering, and reaping, peasants have little work. This period becomes a major time for religious festivals, marriages, ceremonies, and frolics. The Ganges is sacred not just for its fertilizing beneficence but also for its impressive appearance: a tranquil, oceanic river, half a mile to a mile wide, flowing slowly and almost imperceptibly through the vast hot plain. Its greenish, muddy water and sandy banks create the illusion, especially in straight reaches and intensified by heat shimmer, of extending broadly over the horizon. Mythologically, Siva (god of the Himalayas) received the powerful torrents of Ganga on his head before releasing her to the plains. Siva's ancient worship, possibly predating the Brahmans, is a Nature worship where earthly phenomena intertwine poetically with spiritual intimations.\n\nOn the Ganges' banks, Benares (Varanasi) stands as one of India's most ancient and sacred cities, a year-round pilgrimage site for Northern Hinduism. Thousands come to bathe, perform funeral rites, and make offerings at its estimated 5,000 shrines; pilgrim tents and camels are often seen outside the town. Situated on slightly raised ground, its riverbanks are dramatically built into numerous picturesque terraces, stairs, temples, and shrines, offering a particularly striking view from the river. Despite small individual architectural elements and narrow streets, it is deemed the author's most characteristic and interesting Indian city.\n\nBenares distinctly lacks English presence—no residents, hotels, or English signage—creating a stark contrast to \"mongrel\" cities and fostering a strong sense of \"organic life.\" Its narrow, vehicle-free alleys, lined with three- or four-storey houses projecting in picturesque confusion (reminiscent of old Italian towns), buzz with a crowd animated by its own distinct standards. Ancient, diverse industries, largely undisturbed by modern invention, thrive in integrated workshops and saleshops. Streets specialize in crafts: brass-workers craft elegant pots of all sizes, used by the populace for carrying water/oil, bathing, and temple offerings—a staple of Indian folk-life—along with brass images and fancy ware. Other streets house sandal/leather workers, sweet-cake confectioners, or sell woollen and cotton wraps (many being Western commercial products). Stone and marble effigies, gems, and numerous cookshops (fortunately meat-free) are also prevalent. The city's inhabitants display many fine faces, particularly grave, peaceful, and penetrative elderly ones, and some composed, affectionate, even spiritual young men, though greed and worldliness are also evident.",

        "content": "One morning Panna Lall—who had come on with me from Calcutta—wanted to bathe at a particular ghaut (as each family or caste has its special sanctuaries), so we went off early to the river-side. He looked quite jaunty in his yellow silk coat with white nether garment and an embroidered cap on his head. As it happened, a spring festival was being celebrated, and everybody was in clean raiment and bright colors, yellow being preferred. As we approached the river the alleys began to get full of people coming up after their baths to the various temples—pretty to see the women in all shades of tawny gold, primrose, saffron, or salmon-pink, bearing their brass bowls and saucers full of flowers, and a supply of Ganges water. The ghauts were thronged. Wandering along them we presently came upon a yogi sitting under the shade of a wall—a rather fine-looking man of thirty-five, or nearing forty, with a kindly unselfconscious262 face—not at all thin or emaciated or ascetic looking, but a wild man decidedly, with his hair long and matted into a few close ringlets, black but turning brown towards his waist, a short unkempt beard, and nothing whatever on but some beads round his neck and the merest apology for a loin-cloth. He sat cross-legged before a log or two forming a small fire, which seemed grateful as the morning was quite cold, and every now and then smeared his body with the wood-ashes, giving it a white and floury appearance. For the rest his furniture was even less than Thoreau’s, and consisted apparently of only one or two logs of firewood kept in reserve, a pair of tongs, and a dry palm-leaf overhead to ward off the sun by day and the dews by night. I looked at him for some time, and he looked at me quietly in return—so I went and sat down near him, joining the circle of his admirers of whom there were four or five. He seemed pleased at this little attention and told me in reply to my questions that he had lived like this since he was a boy, and that he was very happy—which indeed he appeared to be. As to eating he said he ate plenty “when it came to him” (i.e. when given to him), and when it didn’t he could go without. I should imagine however from his appearance that he did pretty well in that matter—though I don’t think the end of his remark was mere brag; for there was that look of insouciance in his face which one detects in the faces of the animals, His friends sat round, but without much communication—at any rate while I was there—except to offer him a whiff out of their pipes every now and then, or drop a263 casual remark, to which he would respond with a quite natural and pleasant laugh. Of any conscious religion or philosophy I don’t think there was a spark in him—simply wildness, and reversion to a life without one vestige of care; but I felt in looking at him that rare pleasure which one experiences in looking at a face without anxiety and without cunning. A little farther on we came to one of the burning ghauts—a sufficiently dismal sight—a blackened hollow running down to the water’s edge, with room for three funereal pyres in it. The evening before we had seen two of these burning—though nearly burnt out—and this morning the ashes only remained, and a third fresh stack was already prepared. As we stood there a corpse was brought down—wrapped in an unbleached cloth (probably the same it wore in life) and slung beneath a pole which was carried on the shoulders of two men. Round about on the jutting verges of the hollow the male relatives (as we had seen them also the day before) sat perched upon their heels, with their cloths drawn over their heads—spectators of the whole operations. I could not help wondering what sort of thoughts were theirs. Here there is no disguise of death and dissolution. The body is placed upon the pyre, which generally in the case of the poor people who come here is insufficiently large, a scanty supply of gums and fragrant oils is provided, the nearest male relative applies the torch himself—and then there remains nothing but to sit for hours and watch the dread process, and at the conclusion if the burning is complete to collect264 the ashes and scatter them on the water, and if not to throw the charred remains themselves into the sacred river. The endurance of the Hindu is proverbial—but to endure such a sight in the case of a dear and near relative seems ultra-human. Every sense is violated and sickened; the burning-ground men themselves are the most abhorred of outcasts—and as they pass to and fro on their avocations the crowd shrinks back from the defilement of their touch. We did not stay more than a few minutes here, but passed on and immediately found ourselves again amongst an animated and gay crowd of worshipers. This was the ghaut where Panna wished to bathe—a fine pyramidal flight of stairs jutting into the water and leading up to the Durga Temple some way above us. While he was making preparations—purchasing flowers, oil, etc.—I sat down in the most retired spot I could find, under an awning, where my presence was not likely to attract attention, and became a quiet spectator of the scene. After all, there is nothing like custom. One might think that in order to induce people to bathe by thousands in muddy half-stagnant water, thick with funeral ashes and drowned flowers, and here and there defiled by a corpse or a portion of one, there must be present an immense amount of religious or other fervor. But nothing of the kind. Except in a few, very few, cases there was no more of this than there is in the crowd going to or from a popular London church on Sunday evening. Mere blind habit was written on most faces.265 There were the country bumpkins, who gazed about them a bit, and the habitués of the place; there were plenty with an eye to business, and plenty as innocent as children; but that it was necessary for some reason or other to bathe in this water was a thing that it clearly did not enter into any one’s head to doubt. It simply had to be done. The coldness of the morning air was forced on my attention by a group of women coming up, dripping and shivering, out of the river and taking their stand close to me. Their long cotton cloths clung to their limbs, and I wondered how they would dress themselves under these conditions. The steps even were reeking with wet and mud, and could not be used for sitting on. They managed however to unwind their wet things and at the same time to put on the dry ones so deftly that in a short time and without any exposure of their bodies they were habited in clean and bright attire. Children in their best clothes, stepping down one foot always first, with silver toe-rings and bangles, were a pretty sight; and aged people of both sexes, bent and tottering, came past pretty frequently; around on the various levels were groups of gossipers, and parties squatting opposite each other, shaving and being shaved. Nearly opposite to me was one of the frequent stone lingams which abound here at corners of streets and in all sorts of nooks, and I was amused by the antics of a goat and a crow, which between them nibbled and nicked off the flowers, ears of barley, and other offerings, as fast as the pious deposited them thereon.",
        "target_summary": "One morning, the narrator and Panna Lall went early to a river ghaut for a bath during a spring festival. Panna Lall was dressed jauntily in yellow silk, matching the festive atmosphere where many people wore clean, bright, yellow attire. As they approached, the alleys filled with people, particularly women in colorful garments, carrying offerings to temples after their baths. The ghauts were thronged.\n\nWandering along, they came upon a yogi under a wall. He was a fine-looking man in his late thirties, with a kindly, unselfconscious face, not ascetic but wild, with long, matted hair, a short beard, and dressed only in beads and a loincloth. He sat cross-legged by a small fire, smearing his body with ashes, with minimal possessions. The narrator joined his small group of admirers. The yogi, seeming pleased, explained he had lived this way happily since boyhood, eating when food was given and going without when it wasn't, though he appeared well-fed. The narrator observed an \"insouciance\" in his face, like animals, and felt he embodied a life without care or conscious religion, finding rare pleasure in his anxiety-free expression.\n\nA little farther on, they encountered a dismal burning ghaut—a blackened hollow by the water with space for three funeral pyres. Earlier pyres were reduced to ashes, and a fresh stack was prepared. A corpse, wrapped in cloth, was brought down, carried by two men. Male relatives sat observing. The narrator reflected on the starkness of death, noting that bodies were often placed on insufficient pyres with scanty oils, ignited by a close male relative, followed by hours of watching the cremation. Ashes were then scattered or charred remains thrown into the sacred river. He found the endurance required to witness this for a loved one \"ultra-human\" and observed the low status of the burning-ground men, from whom crowds recoiled. They left after a few minutes.\n\nImmediately, they rejoined an animated crowd at Panna's chosen bathing ghaut, a pyramidal flight of stairs leading to a Durga Temple. While Panna prepared to bathe, the narrator sat discreetly, observing. He was surprised by the apparent lack of intense religious fervor among the thousands bathing in the muddy, stagnant water, often defiled by ashes, flowers, or even corpses. Instead, most faces reflected \"mere blind habit\"—an unquestioning necessity to perform the ritual. He noted groups of shivering women deftly changing clothes, children with silver adornments, the elderly, gossiping groups, and people shaving. He was amused to see a goat and a crow picking offerings from a stone lingam nearby.",

He was a man of a little over thirty perhaps, clothed in a yellow garment—not very tall though of good figure; but his left arm was uplifted in life-long penance. There was no doubt about it; the bare limb, to some extent dwindled, went straight up from the shoulder and ended in a little hand, which looked like the hand of a child—with fingers inbent and ending in long claw-like nails, while the thumb, which was comparatively large in proportion to the fingers, went straight up between the second and third. The mans face was smeared all over with a yellow pigment (saffron), and this together with his matted hair gave him a wild and demonish appearance. One often reads of such things, yet somehow without quite realising them; certainly the sight of this deliberate and lifelong mutilation of the human body gave me a painful feeling—which was by no means removed by the expression of the face, with its stultified sadness, and brutishness not without deceit. His extended right hand demanded a coin, which I gladly gave him, and after invoking some kind of blessing he turned away through the crowd—his poor dwindled hand and half-closed fingers visible for some time over the heads of the people. Poor fellow! how little spiritual good his sufferings had done him. His heavy-browed face haunted me for some time. For the rest he was well-liking enough, and it must be said that these fellows for the267 most part make a fair living out of the pious charity of the people, though I would not be understood to say that all of them adopt this mode of life with that object. When Panna came up out of the water and had dressed himself, and I had satisfied the curiosity of one or two bystanders who wanted to know whether I had come with him all the way on this pilgrimage out of friendship, we went up to the temple above—where a little band was playing strange and grisly music, and a few devotees were chanting before an image of Siva—and having made an offering returned to our hotel.",

In some alarm you ask for the native city and find that it is four miles off! You cannot possibly walk there along the dusty roads, and there is nothing for it but to drive. If there is anything of the nature of a “sight” in the city you are of course beset by drivers; in any case you ultimately have to undergo the ignominy of being jogged through the town in a two-horse conveyance, stared at by the people, followed by guides, pestered for bakshish, and are glad to get back to the shelter of your hotel. If you go and stay with your Anglo-Indian friend in his villa-bungalow, you are only a shade worse off instead of better. He is hospitality itself and will introduce you cordially to all the other good folk, whom (and their ways) you have seen more269 than once before at Wandsworth and at Kew; but as to the people of the country, why, you are no nearer them physically, and morally you are farther off because you are in the midst of a society where it is the correct thing to damn the oyster, and all that is connected with him. The more one sees of the world the more one is impressed, I think, by the profundity and the impassibility of the gulf of race-difference. Two races may touch, may mingle, may occupy for a time the same land; they may recognise each other’s excellencies, may admire and imitate each other; individuals may even cross the dividing line and be absorbed on either side; but ultimately the gulf reasserts itself, the deepset difference makes itself felt, and for reasons which neither party very clearly understands they cease to tolerate each other. They separate, like oil and water; or break into flame and fierce conflict; or the one perishes withering from the touch of the other. There are a few souls, born travelers and such like, for whom race-barriers do not exist, and who are everywhere at home, but they are rare. For the world at large the great race-divisions are very deep, very insuperable. Here is a vast problem. The social problem which to-day hangs over the Western lands is a great one; but this looms behind it, even vaster. Anyhow in India the barrier is plain enough to be seen—more than physical, more than intellectual, more than moral—a deepset ineradicable incompatibility. Take that difference in the conception of Duty, to which I have already alluded. The central core of the orthodox Englishman, or at any rate of the270 public-school boy who ultimately becomes our most accepted type, is perhaps to be found in that word. It is that which makes him the dull, narrow-minded, noble, fearless, reliable man that he is. The moving forces of the Hindu are quite different; they are, first, Religion; and second, Affection; and it is these which make him so hopelessly unpractical, so abominably resigned, yet withal so tender and imaginative of heart. Abstract duty to the Hindu has but little meaning. He may perform his religious exercises and his caste injunctions carefully enough, but it is because he realises clearly the expediency of so doing. And what can the Englishman understand of this man who sits on his haunches at a railway station for a whole day meditating on the desirability of not being born again! They do not and they cannot understand each other. Many of the I.C.S. are very able, disinterested, hardworking men, but one feels that they work from basic assumptions which are quite alien to the Hindu mind, and they can only see with sorrow that their work takes no hold upon the people and its affections. The materialistic and commercial spirit of Western rule can never blend with the profoundly religious character of the social organisation normal to India. We undertake the most obviously useful works, the administration of justice, the construction of tanks and railways, in a genuine spirit of material expediency and with a genuine anxiety to secure a 5 per cent. return; to the Hindu all this is as nothing—it does not touch him in the least. Unfortunately, since the substitution of mere open competition for the remains of noblesse oblige, which",
        "target_summary": "It is profoundly challenging for visitors to truly experience the \"real India\" and its people. Tourists typically arrive at a railway station and are whisked away to hotels within Western-style enclaves, characterized by straight, shady avenues, villas, churches, and activities like lawn-tennis and whisky. This insulated environment, apart from the climate and single-story houses, could easily be mistaken for a European suburb. The native city is often miles away, necessitating a drive that results in an uncomfortable, superficial interaction—being stared at, hounded by guides, and solicited for bakshish—making visitors eager to return to their hotel. Even staying with Anglo-Indian friends offers no deeper connection, as their society mirrors European culture and often expresses disdain for local ways.\n\nThis observation points to a deep and seemingly insurmountable gulf of race-difference. While different races may interact, coexist, admire, and even imitate each other, and individuals might occasionally cross cultural boundaries, ultimately, this fundamental divide reasserts itself. This leads to separation, fierce conflict, or the decline of one culture by contact with another. Although a rare few, like born travelers, transcend these barriers, for the vast majority, race divisions are profoundly deep and insuperable—a problem even greater than contemporary Western social issues.\n\nIn India specifically, this barrier manifests as a deepset, ineradicable incompatibility that extends beyond physical, intellectual, or moral differences. A primary example is the contrasting understanding of \"Duty.\" For the archetypal Englishman, especially the public-school educated type, \"Duty\" forms his core, making him reliable and fearless, though sometimes perceived as dull or narrow-minded. Conversely, the Hindu is driven by \"Religion\" and \"Affection,\" which, while fostering tenderness and imagination, also contribute to an unpractical and resigned disposition. Abstract duty holds little meaning for the Hindu; religious and caste observances are performed for their clear expediency. This leads to a fundamental mutual incomprehension, exemplified by an Englishman's inability to grasp a Hindu meditating for an entire day on avoiding rebirth.\n\nConsequently, even highly capable, disinterested, and diligent I.C.S. (Indian Civil Service) officials, operating from assumptions alien to the Hindu mind, find their work fails to resonate with the people. Their initiatives, such as administering justice or constructing infrastructure like tanks and railways—undertaken with a genuine spirit of material expediency and a desire for financial return—do not connect with the affections of the Indian populace. The materialistic and commercial ethos of Western rule simply cannot blend with the profoundly religious character inherent in India's social organization.",

        "content": "The story of our world is a story that is still very imperfectly known. A couple of hundred years ago men possessed the history of little more than the last three thousand years. What happened before that time was a matter of legend and speculation. Over a large part of the civilized world it was believed and taught that the world had been created suddenly in 4004 B.C., though authorities differed as to whether this had occurred in the spring or autumn of that year. This fantastically precise misconception was based upon a too literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible, and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions connected therewith. Such ideas have long since been abandoned by religious teachers, and it is universally recognized that the universe in which we live has to all appearances existed for an enormous period of time and possibly for endless time. Of course there may be deception in these appearances, as a room may be made to seem endless by putting mirrors facing each other at either end. But that the universe in which we live has existed only for six or seven thousand years may be regarded as an altogether exploded idea. The earth, as everybody knows nowadays, is a spheroid, a sphere slightly compressed, orange fashion, with a diameter of nearly 8,000 miles. Its spherical shape has been known at least to a limited number of intelligent people for nearly 2,500 years, but before that time it was supposed to be flat, and various ideas which now seem fantastic were entertained about its relations to the sky and the stars and planets. We know now that it rotates upon its axis (which is about 24 miles shorter than its equatorial diameter) every twenty-four hours, and that this is the cause of the alternations of day and night, that it circles about the sun in a slightly distorted and slowly variable oval path in a year. Its distance from the sun varies between ninety-one and a half millions at its nearest and ninety-four and a half million miles. About the earth circles a smaller sphere, the moon, at an average distance of 239,000 miles. Earth and moon are not the only bodies to travel round the sun. There are also the planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of thirty-six and sixty-seven millions of miles; and beyond the circle of the earth and disregarding a belt of numerous smaller bodies, the planetoids, there are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune at mean distances of 141, 483, 886, 1,782, and 1,793 millions of miles respectively. These figures in millions of miles are very difficult for the mind to grasp. It may help the reader’s imagination if we reduce the sun and planets to a smaller, more conceivable scale. If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter, the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, that is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutes’ walking. The moon would be a small pea two feet and a half from the world. Between earth and sun there would be the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of one hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and fifty yards from the sun. All round and about these bodies there would be emptiness until you came to Mars, a hundred and seventy-five feet beyond the earth; Jupiter nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter; Saturn, a little smaller, two miles off; Uranus four miles off and Neptune six miles off. Then nothingness and nothingness except for small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapour for thousands of miles. The nearest star to earth on this scale would be 40,000 miles away. These figures will serve perhaps to give one some conception of the immense emptiness of space in which the drama of life goes on. For in all this enormous vacancy of space we know certainly of life only upon the surface of our earth. It does not penetrate much more than three miles down into the 4,000 miles that separate us from the centre of our globe, and it does not reach more than five miles above its surface. Apparently all the limitlessness of space is otherwise empty and dead. The deepest ocean dredgings go down to five miles. The highest recorded flight of an aeroplane is little more than four miles. Men have reached to seven miles up in balloons, but at a cost of great suffering. No bird can fly so high as five miles, and small birds and insects which have been carried up by aeroplanes drop off insensible far below that level.",
        "target_summary": "Our understanding of world history has significantly deepened. Just a couple of hundred years ago, knowledge was largely confined to the last three millennia, with the world widely believed to have been created suddenly in 4004 B.C. This \"fantastically precise misconception,\" based on a literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible, has since been abandoned. It is now universally recognized that the universe has existed for an enormous, possibly endless, period.\n\nThe Earth, a spheroid of nearly 8,000 miles in diameter, was once thought flat, but its spherical shape has been known for almost 2,500 years. It rotates on its axis every twenty-four hours, causing day and night, and completes an annual orbit around the sun in a slightly oval path, with its distance varying between 91.5 and 94.5 million miles. Orbiting the Earth is the Moon, a smaller sphere, at an average distance of 239,000 miles.\n\nBeyond Earth and Moon, other planets circle the sun: Mercury (36 million miles) and Venus (67 million miles) are closer. Further out, past a belt of planetoids, are Mars (141 million), Jupiter (483 million), Saturn (886 million), Uranus (1,782 million), and Neptune (1,793 million miles). To grasp these immense distances, imagine Earth as a one-inch ball; the sun would be a nine-foot globe 323 yards away. On this scale, the Moon would be a small pea 2.5 feet from Earth, Mercury and Venus would be 125 and 250 yards from the sun respectively, and the outer planets would stretch from Mars 175 feet beyond Earth to Neptune six miles away. The nearest star on this scale would be an astounding 40,000 miles distant, vividly illustrating the immense emptiness of space.\n\nDespite this enormous cosmic vacancy, life is certainly known only on Earth. It exists within a remarkably narrow band: penetrating no more than three miles down into the globe and reaching no more than five miles above its surface. Record ocean dredgings reach five miles, and the highest aeroplane flights are just over four miles, while men have gone up seven miles in balloons with great difficulty, showing the extreme limits of life's known physical reach.

        "title": "THE WORLD IN TIME",
        "content": "In the last fifty years there has been much very fine and interesting speculation on the part of scientific men upon the age and origin of our earth. Here we cannot pretend to give even a summary of such speculations because they involve the most subtle mathematical and physical considerations. The truth is that the physical and astronomical sciences are still too undeveloped as yet to make anything of the sort more than an illustrative guesswork. The general tendency has been to make the estimated age of our globe longer and longer. It now seems probable that the earth has had an independent existence as a spinning planet flying round and round the sun for a longer period than 2,000,000,000 years. It may have been much longer than that. This is a length of time that absolutely overpowers the imagination. Before that vast period of separate existence, the sun and earth and the other planets that circulate round the sun may have been a great swirl of diffused matter in space. The telescope reveals to us in various parts of the heavens luminous spiral clouds of matter, the spiral nebulæ, which appear to be in rotation about a centre. It is supposed by many astronomers that the sun and its planets were once such a spiral, and that their matter has undergone concentration into its present form. Through majestic æons that concentration went on until in that vast remoteness of the past for which we have given figures, the world and its moon were distinguishable. They were spinning then much faster than they are spinning now; they were at a lesser distance from the sun; they travelled round it very much faster, and they were probably incandescent or molten at the surface. The sun itself was a much greater blaze in the heavens. If we could go back through that infinitude of time and see the earth in this earlier stage of its history, we should behold a scene more like the interior of a blast furnace or the surface of a lava flow before it cools and cakes over than any other contemporary scene. No water would be visible because all the water there was would still be superheated steam in a stormy atmosphere of sulphurous and metallic vapours. Beneath this would swirl and boil an ocean of molten rock substance. Across a sky of fiery clouds the glare of the hurrying sun and moon would sweep swiftly like hot breaths of flame. Slowly by degrees as one million of years followed another, this fiery scene would lose its eruptive incandescence. The vapours in the sky would rain down and become less dense overhead; great slaggy cakes of solidifying rock would appear upon the surface of the molten sea, and sink under it, to be replaced by other floating masses. The sun and moon growing now each more distant and each smaller, would rush with diminishing swiftness across the heavens. The moon now, because of its smaller size, would be already cooled far below incandescence, and would be alternately obstructing and reflecting the sunlight in a series of eclipses and full moons. And so with a tremendous slowness through the vastness of time, the earth would grow more and more like the earth on which we live, until at last an age would come when, in the cooling air, steam would begin to condense into clouds, and the first rain would fall hissing upon the first rocks below. For endless millenia the greater part of the earth’s water would still be vaporized in the atmosphere, but there would now be hot streams running over the crystallizing rocks below and pools and lakes into which these streams would be carrying detritus and depositing sediment. At last a condition of things must have been attained in which a man might have stood up on earth and looked about him and lived. If we could have visited the earth at that time we should have stood on great lava-like masses of rock without a trace of soil or touch of living vegetation, under a storm-rent sky. Hot and violent winds, exceeding the fiercest tornado that ever blows, and downpours of rain such as our milder, slower earth to-day knows nothing of, might have assailed us. The water of the downpour would have rushed by us, muddy with the spoils of the rocks, coming together into torrents, cutting deep gorges and canyons as they hurried past to deposit their sediment in the earliest seas. Through the clouds we should have glimpsed a great sun moving visibly across the sky, and in its wake and in the wake of the moon would have come a diurnal tide of earthquake and upheaval. And the moon, which nowadays keeps one constant face to earth, would then have been rotating visibly and showing the side it now hides so inexorably. The earth aged. One million years followed another, and the day lengthened, the sun grew more distant and milder, the moon’s pace in the sky slackened; the intensity of rain and storm diminished and the water in the first seas increased and ran together into the ocean garment our planet henceforth wore. But there was no life as yet upon the earth; the seas were lifeless, and the rocks were barren.",
        "target_summary": "Scientific speculation on Earth's age and origin, while intriguing, is currently considered \"illustrative guesswork\" due to the undeveloped state of physical and astronomical sciences. However, estimations consistently point to an increasingly vast age for our planet. It now seems probable that Earth has existed independently as a spinning planet orbiting the sun for over 2 billion years, a duration \"absolutely overpowering the imagination.\"\n\nBefore this period, the sun, Earth, and other planets likely originated from a vast, rotating \"spiral nebula\" – a swirl of diffused matter in space, similar to luminous clouds observed today. Astronomers theorize this matter gradually concentrated over \"majestic æons\" into the solar system's present form. In its earliest distinguishable stages, the Earth and moon spun much faster, were closer to the sun, and were probably incandescent or molten, with the sun a \"greater blaze\" in the heavens.\n\nThis primordial Earth was a scene resembling a blast furnace or active lava flow. All water existed as superheated steam within a stormy atmosphere of sulphurous and metallic vapours, swirling above an ocean of molten rock. Fiery clouds filled a sky where the glare of the rapidly moving sun and moon swept swiftly.\n\nGradually, over millions of years, this fiery incandescence diminished. Vapours rained down, and a solidifying crust of \"slaggy cakes\" formed on the molten surface, sinking and reforming. The sun and moon became more distant, appeared smaller, and moved with decreasing swiftness. The moon, cooling faster, would have already ceased to be incandescent, creating a visible cycle of eclipses and full moons.\n\nThis \"tremendous slowness\" continued, with Earth slowly evolving towards its present form. Eventually, in the cooling air, steam condensed into clouds, and the first rain fell, hissing onto the primordial rocks. For countless millennia, much of Earth's water remained atmospheric, but hot streams began to flow over the crystallizing rocks, forming pools and lakes where sediment accumulated.\n\nEven when conditions might have allowed a person to stand on Earth, it remained a harsh, lifeless landscape of lava-like rock, devoid of soil or vegetation, under a storm-rent sky. Violent winds and torrential rains, far exceeding modern weather, carved deep gorges and canyons, carrying sediment to early seas. The visibly moving sun, along with the moon, caused daily earthquakes and upheavals. The moon, unlike today, would have visibly rotated, showing all its sides.\n\nAs millions more years passed, the day lengthened, the sun grew milder and more distant, and the moon's pace slowed. Rain and storms lessened, and the accumulating water formed the vast oceans. Yet, despite these profound changes, the Earth remained barren; the seas were lifeless, and the rocks showed no trace of living things.",

        "title": "THE BEGINNINGS OF LIFE",
        "content": "As everybody knows nowadays, the knowledge we possess of life before the beginnings of human memory and tradition is derived from the markings and fossils of living things in the stratified rocks. We find preserved in shale and slate, limestone, and sandstone, bones, shells, fibres, stems, fruits, footmarks, scratchings and the like, side by side with the ripple marks of the earliest tides and the pittings of the earliest rain-falls. It is by the sedulous examination of this Record of the Rocks that the past history of the earth’s life has been pieced together. That much nearly everybody knows to-day. The sedimentary rocks do not lie neatly stratum above stratum; they have been crumpled, bent, thrust about, distorted and mixed together like the leaves of a library that has been repeatedly looted and burnt, and it is only as a result of many devoted lifetimes of work that the record has been put into order and read. The whole compass of time represented by the record of the rocks is now estimated as 1,600,000,000 years. The earliest rocks in the record are called by geologists the Azoic rocks, because they show no traces of life. Great areas of these Azoic rocks lie uncovered in North America, and they are of such a thickness that geologists consider that they represent a period of at least half of the 1,600,000,000 which they assign to the whole geological record. Let me repeat this profoundly significant fact. Half the great interval of time since land and sea were first distinguishable on earth has left us no traces of life. There are ripplings and rain marks still to be found in these rocks, but no marks nor vestiges of any living thing. Then, as we come up the record, signs of past life appear and increase. The age of the world’s history in which we find these past traces is called by geologists the Lower Palæozoic age. The first indications that life was astir are vestiges of comparatively simple and lowly things: the shells of small shellfish, the stems and flowerlike heads of zoophytes, seaweeds and the tracks and remains of sea worms and crustacea. Very early appear certain creatures rather like plant-lice, crawling creatures which could roll themselves up into balls as the plant-lice do, the trilobites. Later by a few million years or so come certain sea scorpions, more mobile and powerful creatures than the world had ever seen before. None of these creatures were of very great size. Among the largest were certain of the sea scorpions, which measured nine feet in length. There are no signs whatever of land life of any sort, plant or animal; there are no fishes nor any vertebrated creatures in this part of the record. Essentially all the plants and creatures which have left us their traces from this period of the earth’s history are shallow-water and intertidal beings. If we wished to parallel the flora and fauna of the Lower Palæozoic rocks on the earth to-day, we should do it best, except in the matter of size, by taking a drop of water from a rock pool or scummy ditch and examining it under a microscope. The little crustacea, the small shellfish, the zoophytes and algæ we should find there would display a quite striking resemblance to these clumsier, larger prototypes that once were the crown of life upon our planet. It is well, however, to bear in mind that the Lower Palæozoic rocks probably do not give us anything at all representative of the first beginnings of life on our planet. Unless a creature has bones or other hard parts, unless it wears a shell or is big enough and heavy enough to make characteristic footprints and trails in mud, it is unlikely to leave any fossilized traces of its existence behind. To-day there are hundreds of thousands of species of small soft-bodied creatures in our world which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark for future geologists to discover. In the world’s past, millions of millions of species of such creatures may have lived and multiplied and flourished and passed away without a trace remaining. The waters of the warm and shallow lakes and seas of the so-called Azoic period may have teemed with an infinite variety of lowly, jelly-like, shell-less and boneless creatures, and a multitude of green scummy plants may have spread over the sunlit intertidal rocks and beaches. The Record of the Rocks is no more a complete record of life in the past than the books of a bank are a record of the existence of everybody in the neighbourhood. It is only when a species begins to secrete a shell or a spicule or a carapace or a lime-supported stem, and so put by something for the future, that it goes upon the Record. But in rocks of an age prior to those which bear any fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined carbon, is sometimes found, and some authorities consider that it may have been separated out from combination through the vital activities of unknown living things.",
        "target_summary": "Our understanding of life predating human memory comes from fossils and markings found in stratified rocks, such as bones, shells, tracks, and ripple marks. Piecing together this \"Record of the Rocks\" is a meticulous process, complicated by the fact that these rock layers are often crumpled and distorted, much like a damaged library.\n\nThe entire geological record is estimated to span 1.6 billion years. The earliest rocks, termed Azoic, cover at least half of this vast period (around 800 million years) and show no traces of life, despite containing evidence of ancient water. This signifies that for half of Earth's history where land and sea were distinguishable, no direct biological evidence has been found.\n\nSigns of life begin to appear and increase in the subsequent Lower Palæozoic age. Early indications point to simple, lowly marine organisms: small shellfish, zoophytes, seaweeds, sea worms, and crustacea. Notable early creatures include trilobites, which were crawling organisms capable of rolling into balls. Later, more mobile and powerful sea scorpions emerged, with some reaching up to nine feet in length. Crucially, this period shows no evidence of land life (plant or animal), fish, or vertebrates; all traces are from shallow-water and intertidal beings, comparable to the microscopic life found in a modern pond, albeit often larger.\n\nIt's important to recognize that the Lower Palæozoic rocks likely don't represent the actual dawn of life. The \"Record of the Rocks\" is inherently incomplete, as only creatures with hard parts (like shells or bones) or those large enough to leave distinct tracks tend to fossilize. Millions of soft-bodied species, both in the past and potentially during the Azoic period, may have lived and vanished without leaving any trace. However, the discovery of graphite (uncombined carbon) in some rocks predating known fossils suggests to some experts that vital activities of unknown organisms might have existed even before direct fossil evidence appears.",

        "title": "THE AGE OF FISHES",
        "content": "In the days when the world was supposed to have endured for only a few thousand years, it was supposed that the different species of plants and animals were fixed and final; they had all been created exactly as they are to-day, each species by itself. But as men began to discover and study the Record of the Rocks this belief gave place to the suspicion that many species had changed and developed slowly through the course of ages, and this again expanded into a belief in what is called Organic Evolution, a belief that all species of life upon earth, animal and vegetable alike, are descended by slow continuous processes of change from some very simple ancestral form of life, some almost structureless living substance, far back in the so-called Azoic seas. This question of Organic Evolution, like the question of the age of the earth, has in the past been the subject of much bitter controversy. There was a time when a belief in organic evolution was for rather obscure reasons supposed to be incompatible with sound Christian, Jewish and Moslem doctrine. That time has passed, and the men of the most orthodox Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Mohammedan belief are now free to accept this newer and broader view of a common origin of all living things. No life seems to have happened suddenly upon earth. Life grew and grows. Age by age through gulfs of time at which imagination reels, life has been growing from a mere stirring in the intertidal slime towards freedom, power and consciousness. Life consists of individuals. These individuals are definite things, they are not like the lumps and masses, nor even the limitless and motionless crystals, of non-living matter, and they have two characteristics no dead matter possesses. They can assimilate other matter into themselves and make it part of themselves, and they can reproduce themselves. They eat and they breed. They can give rise to other individuals, for the most part like themselves, but always also a little different from themselves. There is a specific and family resemblance between an individual and its offspring, and there is an individual difference between every parent and every offspring it produces, and this is true in every species and at every stage of life. Now scientific men are not able to explain to us either why offspring should resemble nor why they should differ from their parents. But seeing that offspring do at once resemble and differ, it is a matter rather of common sense than of scientific knowledge that, if the conditions under which a species live are changed, the species should undergo some correlated changes. Because in any generation of the species there must be a number of individuals whose individual differences make them better adapted to the new conditions under which the species has to live, and a number whose individuals whose individual differences make it rather harder for them to live. And on the whole the former sort will live longer, bear more offspring, and reproduce themselves more abundantly than the latter, and so generation by generation the average of the species will change in the favourable direction. This process, which is called Natural Selection, is not so much a scientific theory as a necessary deduction from the facts of reproduction and individual difference. There may be many forces at work varying, destroying and preserving species, about which science may still be unaware or undecided, but the man who can deny the operation of this process of natural selection upon life since its beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of life or incapable of ordinary thought. Many scientific men have speculated about the first beginning of life and their speculations are often of great interest, but there is absolutely no definite knowledge and no convincing guess yet of the way in which life began. But nearly all authorities are agreed that it probably began upon mud or sand in warm sunlit shallow brackish water, and that it spread up the beaches to the intertidal lines and out to the open waters. That early world was a world of strong tides and currents. An incessant destruction of individuals must have been going on through their being swept up the beaches and dried, or by their being swept out to sea and sinking down out of reach of air and sun. Early conditions favoured the development of every tendency to root and hold on, every tendency to form an outer skin and casing to protect the stranded individual from immediate desiccation. From the very earliest any tendency to sensitiveness to taste would turn the individual in the direction of food, and any sensitiveness to light would assist it to struggle back out of the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to wriggle back out of the excessive glare of the dangerous shallows. Probably the first shells and body armour of living things were protections against drying rather than against active enemies. But tooth and claw come early into our earthly history. We have already noted the size of the earlier water scorpions. For long ages such creatures were the supreme lords of life. Then in a division of these Palæozoic rocks called the Silurian division, which many geologists now suppose to be as old as five hundred million years, there appears a new type of being, equipped with eyes and teeth and swimming powers of an altogether more powerful kind. These were the first known backboned animals, the earliest fishes, the first known Vertebrata. These fishes increase greatly in the next division of rocks, the rocks known as the Devonian system. They are so prevalent that this period of the Record of the Rocks has been called the Age of Fishes. Fishes of a pattern now gone from the earth, and fishes allied to the sharks and sturgeons of to-day, rushed through the waters, leapt in the air, browsed among the seaweeds, pursued and preyed upon one another, and gave a new liveliness to the waters of the world. None of these were excessively big by our present standards. Few of them were more than two or three feet long, but there were exceptional forms which were as long as twenty feet. We know nothing from geology of the ancestors of these fishes. They do not appear to be related to any of the forms that preceded them. Zoologists have the most interesting views of their ancestry, but these they derive from the study of the development of the eggs of their still living relations, and from other sources. Apparently the ancestors of the vertebrata were soft-bodied and perhaps quite small swimming creatures who began first to develop hard parts as teeth round and about their mouths. The teeth of a skate or dogfish cover the roof and floor of its mouth and pass at the lip into the flattened toothlike scales that encase most of its body. As the fishes develop these teeth scales in the geological record, they swim out of the hidden darkness of the past into the light, the first vertebrated animals visible in the record.",
        "target_summary": "The early belief that plant and animal species were fixed, individually created, and only a few thousand years old profoundly changed with the discovery and study of the \"Record of the Rocks.\" This geological evidence suggested that many species had slowly changed and developed over vast ages, leading to the widely accepted concept of Organic Evolution. This theory posits that all life forms on Earth, animal and vegetable alike, descended through slow, continuous processes of change from some very simple ancestral forms, possibly even structureless living substances, far back in the ancient Azoic seas.\n\nOrganic Evolution, much like the question of the earth's age, was historically a subject of bitter controversy, with some deeming it incompatible with Christian, Jewish, and Moslem doctrines. However, that time has largely passed. Today, individuals of the most orthodox Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and Mohammedan beliefs are now generally free to accept this newer and broader view of a common origin for all living things.\n\nLife on Earth did not appear suddenly; rather, it has grown and continues to grow over immense, \"imagination-reeling\" gulfs of time, evolving from simple stirrings in intertidal slime towards greater complexity, freedom, power, and consciousness. Life consists of distinct individuals, which, unlike non-living matter, can assimilate other matter and reproduce themselves. While offspring generally resemble their parents, they invariably possess individual differences. Though science doesn't fully explain why offspring both resemble and differ, these facts are fundamental. If environmental conditions change, certain individuals with advantageous differences will be better adapted, live longer, and produce more offspring than those less suited. Consequently, over generations, the average characteristics of the species will shift in a favorable direction. This process, known as Natural Selection, is presented not merely as a scientific theory but as a necessary deduction from the observable facts of reproduction and individual variation. Denying natural selection's operation since life's beginning implies either ignorance of basic life facts or a lack of ordinary thought.\n\nWhile the precise beginning of life remains unknown and a subject of speculation rather than definite knowledge, most authorities agree it likely originated on mud or sand in warm, sunlit, shallow brackish water, subsequently spreading to intertidal zones and open waters. The harsh conditions of that early world, marked by strong tides and currents, led to the constant destruction of individuals through drying or being swept out to sea. This environment strongly favored the evolution of adaptations such as tendencies to root and hold on, outer skins or casings for protection against immediate desiccation, and sensory capabilities like taste for finding food and light sensitivity for navigating the darkness of deeps or the glare of dangerous shallows. Initial protective features, such as shells and body armor, probably served more to guard against drying than against active enemies.\n\nHowever, \"tooth and claw\" emerged early in Earth's history, with creatures like the large water scorpions dominating for long ages. Then, around 500 million years ago, in the Silurian division of the Palæozoic rocks, a new and more powerful type of being appeared: the first known backboned animals, or Vertebrata – the earliest fishes, equipped with eyes, teeth, and superior swimming powers. These fishes diversified immensely during the subsequent Devonian period, leading it to be called the \"Age of Fishes.\" These ancient fishes, including forms now extinct and ancestors of modern sharks and sturgeons, were vibrant inhabitants of the waters, rushing, leaping, browsing, and preying upon one another. Most were only two or three feet long, though exceptional forms reached up to twenty feet. The geological record doesn't reveal the direct ancestors of these fishes; zoological studies, drawing from the development of eggs of living relatives, suggest they were soft-bodied, perhaps small, swimming creatures that first developed hard parts as teeth around their mouths. These dental structures eventually extended to form flattened, tooth-like scales that encased much of their bodies, marking their visible emergence into the geological record.",

        "content": "The land during this Age of Fishes was apparently quite lifeless. Crags and uplands of barren rock lay under the sun and rain. There was no real soil—for as yet there were no earthworms which help to make a soil, and no plants to break up the rock particles into mould; there was no trace of moss or lichen. Life was still only in the sea. Over this world of barren rock played great changes of climate. The causes of these changes of climate were very complex and they have still to be properly estimated. The changing shape of the earth’s orbit, the gradual shifting of the poles of rotation, changes in the shapes of the continents, probably even fluctuations in the warmth of the sun, now conspired to plunge great areas of the earth’s surface into long periods of cold and ice and now again for millions of years spread a warm or equable climate over this planet. There seem to have been phases of great internal activity in the world’s history, when in the course of a few million years accumulated upthrusts would break out in lines of volcanic eruption and upheaval and rearrange the mountain and continental outlines of the globe, increasing the depth of the sea and the height of the mountains and exaggerating the extremes of climate. And these would be followed by vast ages of comparative quiescence, when frost, rain and river would wear down the mountain heights and carry great masses of silt to fill and raise the sea bottoms and spread the seas, ever shallower and wider, over more and more of the land. There have been “high and deep” ages in the world’s history and “low and level” ages. The reader must dismiss from his mind any idea that the surface of the earth has been growing steadily cooler since its crust grew solid. After that much cooling had been achieved, the internal temperature ceased to affect surface conditions. There are traces of periods of superabundant ice and snow, of “Glacial Ages,” that is, even in the Azoic period. It was only towards the close of the Age of Fishes, in a period of extensive shallow seas and lagoons, that life spread itself out in any effectual way from the waters on to the land. No doubt the earlier types of the forms that now begin to appear in great abundance had already been developing in a rare and obscure manner for many scores of millions of years. But now came their opportunity. Plants no doubt preceded animal forms in this invasion of the land, but the animals probably followed up the plant emigration very closely. The first problem that the plant had to solve was the problem of some sustaining stiff support to hold up its fronds to the sunlight when the buoyant water was withdrawn; the second was the problem of getting water from the swampy ground below to the tissues of the plant, now that it was no longer close at hand. The two problems were solved by the development of woody tissue which both sustained the plant and acted as water carrier to the leaves. The Record of the Rocks is suddenly crowded by a vast variety of woody swamp plants, many of them of great size, big tree mosses, tree ferns, gigantic horsetails and the like. And with these, age by age, there crawled out of the water a great variety of animal forms. There were centipedes and millipedes; there were the first primitive insects; there were creatures related to the ancient king crabs and sea scorpions which became the earliest spiders and land scorpions, and presently there were vertebrated animals. Some of the earlier insects were very large. There were dragon flies in this period with wings that spread out to twenty-nine inches. In various ways these new orders and genera had adapted themselves to breathing air. Hitherto all animals had breathed air dissolved in water, and that indeed is what all animals still have to do. But now in divers fashions the animal kingdom was acquiring the power of supplying its own moisture where it was needed. A man with a perfectly dry lung would suffocate to-day; his lung surfaces must be moist in order that air may pass through them into his blood. The adaptation to air breathing consists in all cases either in the development of a cover to the old-fashioned gills to stop evaporation, or in the development of tubes or other new breathing organs lying deep inside the body and moistened by a watery secretion. The old gills with which the ancestral fish of the vertebrated line had breathed were inadaptable to breathing upon land, and in the case of this division of the animal kingdom it is the swimming bladder of the fish which becomes a new, deep-seated breathing organ, the lung. The kind of animals known as amphibia, the frogs and newts of to-day, begin their lives in the water and breathe by gills; and subsequently the lung, developing in the same way as the swimming bladder of many fishes do, as a baglike outgrowth from the throat, takes over the business of breathing, the animal comes out on land, and the gills dwindle and the gill slits disappear. (All except an outgrowth of one gill slit, which becomes the passage of the ear and ear-drum.) The animal can now live only in the air, but it must return at least to the edge of the water to lay its eggs and reproduce its kind. All the air-breathing vertebrata of this age of swamps and plants belonged to the class amphibia. They were nearly all of them forms related to the newts of to-day, and some of them attained a considerable size. They were land animals, it is true, but they were land animals needing to live in and near moist and swampy places, and all the great trees of this period were equally amphibious in their habits. None of them had yet developed fruits and seeds of a kind that could fall on land and develop with the help only of such moisture as dew and rain could bring. They all had to shed their spores in water, it would seem, if they were to germinate. It is one of the most beautiful interests of that beautiful science, comparative anatomy, to trace the complex and wonderful adaptations of living things to the necessities of existence in air. All living things, plants and animals alike, are primarily water things. For example all the higher vertebrated animals above the fishes, up to and including man, pass through a stage in their development in the egg or before birth in which they have gill slits which are obliterated before the young emerge. The bare, water-washed eye of the fish is protected in the higher forms from drying up by eyelids and glands which secrete moisture. The weaker sound vibrations of air necessitate an ear-drum. In nearly every organ of the body similar modifications and adaptations are to be detected, similar patchings-up to meet aerial conditions. This Carboniferous age, this age of the amphibia, was an age of life in the swamps and lagoons and on the low banks among these waters. Thus far life had now extended. The hills and high lands were still quite barren and lifeless. Life had learnt to breathe air indeed, but it still had its roots in its native water; it still had to return to the water to reproduce its kind.",
        "target_summary": "During the Age of Fishes, land remained lifeless—barren rock devoid of soil, plants, earthworms, moss, or lichen; all life was confined to the sea. This desolate world experienced complex, dramatic climate changes, driven by factors like Earth's orbital shifts, pole movements, continental alterations, and solar warmth fluctuations, leading to alternating prolonged periods of cold/ice and warm climates over millions of years. Earth's history also featured \"high and deep\" ages of intense internal activity, volcanic upheavals, mountain-building, and deeper seas, which were succeeded by \"low and level\" ages of erosion, flattening mountains, filling sea beds with silt, and spreading shallow seas. This geological dynamism refutes the idea of a steadily cooling Earth, as internal temperatures ceased to affect surface conditions early on, with evidence of Glacial Ages existing even in the Azoic period.\n\nLife only successfully transitioned from water to land towards the close of the Age of Fishes, during a period characterized by extensive shallow seas and lagoons. Plants led this invasion, though earlier forms likely developed obscurely for millions of years, closely followed by animals. Plants solved two critical challenges: developing woody tissue for stiff support to withstand gravity without water's buoyancy, and for transporting water from the ground to their tissues. This adaptation led to a rapid diversification of large woody swamp plants, including tree mosses, tree ferns, and gigantic horsetails.\n\nConcurrently, a diverse array of animal forms emerged from the water, such as centipedes, millipedes, primitive insects (some very large, like 29-inch dragonflies), and creatures evolving into early spiders and land scorpions. Vertebrates also appeared, adapting to air breathing, which fundamentally requires moist surfaces for gas exchange. Adaptations included covering gills to prevent evaporation or developing internal, deeply seated breathing organs (like tubes) kept moist by secretions. For vertebrates, ancestral fish gills were unsuitable for land; instead, the fish's swimming bladder evolved into a new, deep-seated lung.\n\nAmphibians, exemplified by modern frogs and newts, begin life in water using gills. Later, a lung develops as a bag-like outgrowth from the throat (similar to the swim bladder's development), allowing the animal to move to land as gills diminish (except for a gill slit outgrowth forming the ear passage). While living in air, amphibians remained tied to water for reproduction. All air-breathing vertebrates of this era were amphibians, often newt-like and sometimes large, requiring moist, swampy environments. The period's massive trees were similarly \"amphibious,\" lacking true seeds for dry land and needing to release spores into water for germination.\n\nComparative anatomy beautifully illustrates how all living things, fundamentally aquatic, adapted to aerial conditions. For instance, higher vertebrates, including humans, exhibit gill slits during development; land animals evolved eyelids and tear glands to protect eyes from drying; and ear-drums developed to detect weaker air vibrations, among countless other bodily modifications. This Carboniferous age, characterized by amphibia, saw life concentrated in swamps and lagoons. While air breathing was established, life remained deeply rooted in water, needing it for reproduction, leaving the hills and higher lands barren and lifeless.",

        "title": "THE AGE OF REPTILES",
        "content": "The abundant life of the Carboniferous period was succeeded by a vast cycle of dry and bitter ages. They are represented in the Record of the Rocks by thick deposits of sandstones and the like, in which fossils are comparatively few. The temperature of the world fluctuated widely, and there were long periods of glacial cold. Over great areas the former profusion of swamp vegetation ceased, and, overlaid by these newer deposits, it began that process of compression and mineralization that gave the world most of the coal deposits of to-day. But it is during periods of change that life undergoes its most rapid modifications, and under hardship that it learns its hardest lessons. As conditions revert towards warmth and moisture again we find a new series of animal and plant forms established, We find in the record the remains of vertebrated animals that laid eggs which, instead of hatching out tadpoles which needed to live for a time in water, carried on their development before hatching to a stage so nearly like the adult form that the young could live in air from the first moment of independent existence. Gills had been cut out altogether, and the gill slits only appeared as an embryonic phase. These new creatures without a tadpole stage were the Reptiles. Concurrently there had been a development of seed-bearing trees, which could spread their seed, independently of swamp or lakes. There were now palmlike cycads and many tropical conifers, though as yet there were no flowering plants and no grasses. There was a great number of ferns. And there was now also an increased variety of insects. There were beetles, though bees and butterflies had yet to come. But all the fundamental forms of a new real land fauna and flora had been laid down during these vast ages of severity. This new land life needed only the opportunity of favourable conditions to flourish and prevail. Age by age and with abundant fluctuations that mitigation came. The still incalculable movements of the earth’s crust, the changes in its orbit, the increase and diminution of the mutual inclination of orbit and pole, worked together to produce a great spell of widely diffused warm conditions. The period lasted altogether, it is now supposed, upwards of two hundred million years. It is called the Mesozoic period, to distinguish it from the altogether vaster Palæozoic and Azoic periods (together fourteen hundred millions) that preceded it, and from the Cainozoic or new life period that intervened between its close and the present time, and it is also called the Age of Reptiles because of the astonishing predominance and variety of this form of life. It came to an end some eighty million years ago. In the world to-day the genera of Reptiles are comparatively few and their distribution is very limited. They are more various, it is true, than are the few surviving members of the order of the amphibia which once in the Carboniferous period ruled the world. We still have the snakes, the turtles and tortoises (the Chelonia), the alligators and crocodiles, and the lizards. Without exception they are creatures requiring warmth all the year round; they cannot stand exposure to cold, and it is probable that all the reptilian beings of the Mesozoic suffered under the same limitation. It was a hothouse fauna, living amidst a hothouse flora. It endured no frosts. But the world had at least attained a real dry land fauna and flora as distinguished from the mud and swamp fauna and flora of the previous heyday of life upon earth.All the sorts of reptile we know now were much more abundantly represented then, great turtles and tortoises, big crocodiles and many lizards and snakes, but in addition there was a number of series of wonderful creatures that have now vanished altogether from the earth. There was a vast variety of beings called the Dinosaurs. Vegetation was now spreading over the lower levels of the world, reeds, brakes of fern and the like; and browsing upon this abundance came a multitude of herbivorous reptiles, which increased in size as the Mesozoic period rose to its climax. Some of these beasts exceeded in size any other land animals that have ever lived; they were as large as whales. The Diplodocus Carnegii for example measured eighty-four feet from snout to tail; the Gigantosaurus was even greater; it measured a hundred feet. Living upon these monsters was a swarm of carnivorous Dinosaurs of a corresponding size. One of these, the Tyrannosaurus, is figured and described in many books as the last word in reptilian frightfulness.While these great creatures pastured and pursued amidst the fronds and evergreens of the Mesozoic jungles, another now vanished tribe of reptiles, with a bat-like development of the fore limbs, pursued insects and one another, first leapt and parachuted and presently flew amidst the fronds and branches of the forest trees. These were the Pterodactyls. These were the first flying creatures with backbones; they mark a new achievement in the growing powers of vertebrated life. Moreover some of the reptiles were returning to the sea waters. Three groups of big swimming beings had invaded the sea from which their ancestors had come: the Mososaurs, the Plesiosaurs, and Ichthyosaurs. Some of these again approached the proportions of our present whales. The Ichthyosaurs seem to have been quite seagoing creatures, but the Plesiosaurs were a type of animal that has no cognate form to-day. The body was stout and big with paddles, adapted either for swimming or crawling through marshes, or along the bottom of shallow waters. The comparatively small head was poised on a vast snake of neck, altogether outdoing the neck of the swan. Either the Plesiosaur swam and searched for food under the water and fed as the swan will do, or it lurked under water and snatched at passing fish or beast. Such was the predominant land life throughout the Mesozoic age. It was by our human standards an advance upon anything that had preceded it. It had produced land animals greater in size, range, power and activity, more “vital” as people say, than anything the world had seen before. In the seas there had been no such advance but a great proliferation of new forms of life. An enormous variety of squid-like creatures with chambered shells, for the most part coiled, had appeared in the shallow seas, the Ammonites. They had had predecessors in the Palæozoic seas, but now was their age of glory. To-day they have left no survivors at all; their nearest relation is the pearly Nautilus, an inhabitant of tropical waters. And a new and more prolific type of fish with lighter, finer scales than the plate-like and tooth-like coverings that had hitherto prevailed, became and has since remained predominant in the seas and rivers.",
        "target_summary": "After the abundant Carboniferous period, Earth endured vast dry and cold ages, which prompted significant evolutionary adaptations. This hardship spurred the emergence of reptiles—vertebrates that laid eggs capable of developing entirely on land, bypassing a water-dependent larval stage. Concurrently, seed-bearing plants like cycads and tropical conifers, along with a greater variety of insects, developed, establishing the foundational forms for true land-based flora and fauna.\n\nEventually, over 200 million years of widespread warm, moist conditions characterized the Mesozoic period, often called the \"Age of Reptiles.\" This \"hothouse\" era, which ended approximately 80 million years ago, saw reptiles, dependent on constant warmth, diversify and dominate far beyond their modern counterparts.\n\nThe Mesozoic featured immense reptilian diversity: colossal herbivorous dinosaurs (some reaching 100 feet like Gigantosaurus) fed on abundant vegetation, supporting equally large carnivorous ones (e.g., Tyrannosaurus). Pterodactyls became the first flying vertebrates, while other reptilian groups like Mososaurs, Plesiosaurs, and Ichthyosaurs re-invaded and thrived in the seas as large marine predators. This era marked a substantial evolutionary advance for land animals. Oceans also saw new life flourish, including a vast array of now-extinct shelled Ammonites and the emergence of more prolific, modern-type fish, which became predominant.",

        "title": "THE FIRST BIRDS AND THE FIRST MAMMALS",
        "content": "In a few paragraphs a picture of the lush vegetation and swarming reptiles of that first great summer of life, the Mesozoic period, has been sketched. But while the Dinosaurs lorded it over the hot selvas and marshy plains and the Pterodactyls filled the forests with their flutterings and possibly with shrieks and croakings as they pursued the humming insect life of the still flowerless shrubs and trees, some less conspicuous and less abundant forms upon the margins of this abounding life were acquiring certain powers and learning certain lessons of endurance, that were to be of the utmost value to their race when at last the smiling generosity of sun and earth began to fade. A group of tribes and genera of hopping reptiles, small creatures of the dinosaur type, seem to have been pushed by competition and the pursuit of their enemies towards the alternatives of extinction or adaptation to colder conditions in the higher hills or by the sea. Among these distressed tribes there was developed a new type of scale—scales that were elongated into quill-like forms and that presently branched into the crude beginnings of feathers. These quill-like scales layover one another and formed a heat-retaining covering more efficient than any reptilian covering that had hitherto existed. So they permitted an invasion of colder regions that were otherwise uninhabited. Perhaps simultaneously with these changes there arose in these creatures a greater solicitude for their eggs. Most reptiles are apparently quite careless about their eggs, which are left for sun and season to hatch. But some of the varieties upon this new branch of the tree of life were acquiring a habit of guarding their eggs and keeping them warm with the warmth of their bodies. With these adaptations to cold other internal modifications were going on that made these creatures, the primitive birds, warm-blooded and independent of basking. The very earliest birds seem to have been seabirds living upon fish, and their fore limbs were not wings but paddles rather after the penguin type. That peculiarly primitive bird, the New Zealand Ki-Wi, has feathers of a very simple sort, and neither flies nor appears to be descended from flying ancestors. In the development of the birds, feathers came before wings. But once the feather was developed the possibility of making a light spread of feathers led inevitably to the wing. We know of the fossil remains of one bird at least which had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long reptilian tail, but which also had a true bird’s wing and which certainly flew and held its own among the pterodactyls of the Mesozoic time. Nevertheless birds were neither varied nor abundant in Mesozoic times. If a man could go back to typical Mesozoic country, he might walk for days and never see or hear such a thing as a bird, though he would see a great abundance of pterodactyls and insects among the fronds and reeds. And another thing he would probably never see, and that would be any sign of a mammal. Probably the first mammals were in existence millions of years before the first thing one could call a bird, but they were altogether too small and obscure and remote for attention. The earliest mammals, like the earliest birds, were creatures driven by competition and pursuit into a life of hardship and adaptation to cold. With them also the scale became quill-like, and was developed into a heat-retaining covering; and they too underwent modifications, similar in kind though different in detail, to become warm-blooded and independent of basking. Instead of feathers they developed hairs, and instead of guarding and incubating their eggs they kept them warm and safe by retaining them inside their bodies until they were almost mature. Most of them became altogether vivaparous and brought their young into the world alive. And even after their young were born they tended to maintain a protective and nutritive association with them. Most but not all mammals to-day have mammæ and suckle their young. Two mammals still live which lay eggs and which have not proper mammæ, though they nourish their young by a nutritive secretion of the under skin; these are the duck-billed platypus and the echidna. The echidna lays leathery eggs and then puts them into a pouch under its belly, and so carries them about warm and safe until they hatch. But just as a visitor to the Mesozoic world might have searched for days and weeks before finding a bird, so, unless he knew exactly where to go and look, he might have searched in vain for any traces of a mammal. Both birds and mammals would have seemed very eccentric and secondary and unimportant creatures in Mesozoic times. The Age of Reptiles lasted, it is now guessed, eighty million years. Had any quasi-human intelligence been watching the world through that inconceivable length of time, how safe and eternal the sunshine and abundance must have seemed, how assured the wallowing prosperity of the dinosaurs and the flapping abundance of the flying lizards! And then the mysterious rhythms and accumulating forces of the universe began to turn against that quasi-eternal stability. That run of luck for life was running out. Age by age, myriad of years after myriad of years, with halts no doubt and retrogressions, came a change towards hardship and extreme conditions, came great alterations of level and great redistributions of mountain and sea. We find one thing in the Record of the Rocks during the decadence of the long Mesozoic age of prosperity that is very significant of steadily sustained changes of condition, and that is a violent fluctuation of living forms and the appearance of new and strange species. Under the gathering threat of extinction the older orders and genera are displaying their utmost capacity for variation and adaptation. The Ammonites for example in these last pages of the Mesozoic chapter exhibit a multitude of fantastic forms. Under settled conditions there is no encouragement for novelties; they do not develop, they are suppressed; what is best adapted is already there. Under novel conditions it is the ordinary type that suffers, and the novelty that may have a better chance to survive and establish itself.... There comes a break in the Record of the Rocks that may represent several million years. There is a veil here still, over even the outline of the history of life. When it lifts again, the Age of Reptiles is at an end; the Dinosaurs, the Plesiosaurs and Ichthyosaurs, the Pterodactyls, the innumerable genera and species of Ammonite have all gone absolutely. In all their stupendous variety they have died out and left no descendants. The cold has killed them. All their final variations were insufficient; they had never hit upon survival conditions. The world had passed through a phase of extreme conditions beyond their powers of endurance, a slow and complete massacre of Mesozoic life has occurred, and we find now a new scene, a new and hardier flora, and a new and hardier fauna in possession of the world. It is still a bleak and impoverished scene with which this new volume of the book of life begins. The cycads and tropical conifers have given place very largely to trees that shed their leaves to avoid destruction by the snows of winter and to flowering plants and shrubs, and where there was formerly a profusion of reptiles, an increasing variety of birds and mammals is entering into their inheritance.",
        "target_summary": "During the Mesozoic period, the world was characterized by lush vegetation and the dominance of reptiles like dinosaurs and pterodactyls. Yet, on the fringes of this environment, less conspicuous forms were developing crucial adaptations for survival. Driven by competition and the need to endure colder conditions, the ancestors of birds evolved from small, hopping reptiles. These creatures developed quill-like scales that became heat-retaining feathers, allowing them to inhabit colder regions. Alongside this, they began to guard and warm their eggs and became warm-blooded. Early birds, like primitive seabirds with paddle-like limbs, demonstrate that feathers developed before true wings. Though fossil evidence shows Mesozoic birds with reptilian features capable of flight, birds were generally rare and undiverse during this reptilian age.\n\nMammals, likely existing millions of years prior to birds, were equally small, obscure, and adapted to hardship and cold. They similarly developed heat-retaining coverings, with scales evolving into hair, and also became warm-blooded. A key difference lay in their reproduction: rather than leaving eggs, they largely retained them internally, leading to live birth (viviparity) and the post-birth nurturing of their young. While most modern mammals suckle, ancient forms like the platypus and echidna still lay eggs. Like birds, mammals were insignificant in the Mesozoic world, difficult to find even for a hypothetical observer.\n\nThe vast \"Age of Reptiles,\" spanning an estimated eighty million years, ultimately ended as environmental conditions shifted dramatically towards colder, more extreme climates and geological changes. While some reptilian groups, like Ammonites, showed a surge of variation in response to these pressures, their adaptations proved insufficient. A significant gap in the fossil record marks a mass extinction event where the dominant dinosaurs, pterodactyls, marine reptiles, and ammonites all died out, unable to endure the severe cold. When the record resumes, the world had transformed, now featuring a hardier flora, including deciduous trees and flowering plants, and a new fauna led by a rapidly diversifying array of birds and mammals, who inherited a world once dominated by reptiles.",

        "title": "THE AGE OF MAMMALS",
        "content": "The opening of the next great period in the life of the earth, the Cainozoic period, was a period of upheaval and extreme volcanic activity. Now it was that the vast masses of the Alps and Himalayas and the mountain backbone of the Rockies and Andes were thrust up, and that the rude outlines of our present oceans and continents appeared. The map of the world begins to display a first dim resemblance to the map of to-day. It is estimated now that between forty and eighty million years have elapsed from the beginnings of the Cainozoic period to the present time. At the outset of the Cainozoic period the climate of the world was austere. It grew generally warmer until a fresh phase of great abundance was reached, after which conditions grew hard again and the earth passed into a series of extremely cold cycles, the Glacial Ages, from which apparently it is now slowly emerging. But we do not know sufficient of the causes of climatic change at present to forecast the possible fluctuations of climatic conditions that lie before us. We may be moving towards increasing sunshine or lapsing towards another glacial age; volcanic activity and the upheaval of mountain masses may be increasing or diminishing; we do not know; we lack sufficient science. With the opening of this period the grasses appear; for the first time there is pasture in the world; and with the full development of the once obscure mammalian type, appear a number of interesting grazing animals and of carnivorous types which prey upon these. At first these early mammals seem to differ only in a few characters from the great herbivorous and carnivorous reptiles that ages before had flourished and then vanished from the earth. A careless observer might suppose that in this second long age of warmth and plenty that was now beginning, nature was merely repeating the first, with herbivorous and carnivorous mammals to parallel the herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, with birds replacing pterodactyls and so on. But this would be an altogether superficial comparison. The variety of the universe is infinite and incessant; it progresses eternally; history never repeats itself and no parallels are precisely true. The differences between the life of the Cainozoic and Mesozoic periods are far profounder than the resemblances. The most fundamental of all these differences lies in the mental life of the two periods. It arises essentially out of the continuing contact of parent and offspring which distinguishes mammalian and in a lesser degree bird life, from the life of the reptile. With very few exceptions the reptile abandons its egg to hatch alone. The young reptile has no knowledge whatever of its parent; its mental life, such as it is, begins and ends with its own experiences. It may tolerate the existence of its fellows but it has no communication with them; it never imitates, never learns from them, is incapable of concerted action with them. Its life is that of an isolated individual. But with the suckling and cherishing of young which was distinctive of the new mammalian and avian strains arose the possibility of learning by imitation, of communication, by warning cries and other concerted action, of mutual control and instruction. A teachable type of life had come into the world. The earliest mammals of the Cainozoic period are but little superior in brain size to the more active carnivorous dinosaurs, but as we read on through the record towards modern times we find, in every tribe and race of the mammalian animals, a steady universal increase in brain capacity. For instance we find at a comparatively early stage that rhinoceros-like beasts appear. There is a creature, the Titanotherium, which lived in the earliest division of this period. It was probably very like a modern rhinoceros in its habits and needs. But its brain capacity was not one tenth that of its living successor. The earlier mammals probably parted from their offspring as soon as suckling was over, but, once the capacity for mutual understanding has arisen, the advantages of continuing the association are very great; and we presently find a number of mammalian species displaying the beginnings of a true social life and keeping together in herds, packs and flocks, watching each other, imitating each other, taking warning from each other’s acts and cries. This is something that the world had not seen before among vertebrated animals. Reptiles and fish may no doubt be found in swarms and shoals; they have been hatched in quantities and similar conditions have kept them together, but in the case of the social and gregarious mammals the association arises not simply from a community of external forces, it is sustained by an inner impulse. They are not merely like one another and so found in the same places at the same times; they like one another and so they keep together. This difference between the reptile world and the world of our human minds is one our sympathies seem unable to pass. We cannot conceive in ourselves the swift uncomplicated urgency of a reptile’s instinctive motives, its appetites, fears and hates. We cannot understand them in their simplicity because all our motives are complicated; our’s are balances and resultants and not simple urgencies. But the mammals and birds have self-restraint and consideration for other individuals, a social appeal, a self- control that is, at its lower level, after our own fashion. We can in consequence establish relations with almost all sorts of them. When they suffer they utter cries and make movements that rouse our feelings. We can make understanding pets of them with a mutual recognition. They can be tamed to self-restraint towards us, domesticated and taught. That unusual growth of brain which is the central fact of Cainozoic times marks a new communication and interdependence of individuals. It foreshadows the development of human societies of which we shall soon be telling. As the Cainozoic period unrolled, the resemblance of its flora and fauna to the plants and animals that inhabit the world to-day increased. The big clumsy Uintatheres and Titanotheres, the Entelodonts and Hyracodons, big clumsy brutes like nothing living, disappeared. On the other hand a series of forms led up by steady degrees from grotesque and clumsy predecessors to the giraffes, camels, horses, elephants, deer, dogs and lions and tigers of the existing world. The evolution of the horse is particularly legible upon the geological record. We have a fairly complete series of forms from a small tapir-like ancestor in the early Cainozoic. Another line of development that has now been pieced together with some precision is that of the llamas and camels.",
        "target_summary": "The Cainozoic period, spanning 40 to 80 million years ago, began with significant geological upheaval, forming major mountain ranges like the Alps, Himalayas, Rockies, and Andes, and establishing the crude outlines of modern continents and oceans. Its climate was initially severe, warmed to a phase of abundance, then cooled into recurring Glacial Ages, from which the Earth is currently emerging, though future climatic shifts remain uncertain due to insufficient scientific understanding.\n\nThis era saw the appearance of grasses, creating the world's first pastures, and the full development of mammals, including diverse grazing animals and their carnivorous predators. While early mammals might seem superficially similar to the preceding reptiles, the Cainozoic's life differed profoundly, primarily in mental life. This stemmed from the sustained parent-offspring contact distinctive of mammals and birds, a stark contrast to reptiles that typically abandon their eggs. Reptile young are isolated, learning only from their own experiences, incapable of imitation, communication, or concerted action.\n\nMammalian and avian nurturing fostered learning through imitation, communication via warning cries, and mutual instruction, introducing a \"teachable type of life.\" Although early mammalian brains were only slightly larger than those of active carnivorous dinosaurs, the Cainozoic record shows a consistent increase in mammalian brain capacity, exemplified by the much smaller brain of the early Titanotherium compared to its rhinoceros descendant. This capacity for mutual understanding led to the development of true social life in many mammalian species—forming herds, packs, and flocks that watched, imitated, and warned each other. Unlike reptile swarms, which gather due to external conditions, mammalian social groups are sustained by an inner impulse, as they \"like\" and choose to stay together.\n\nHumans find it challenging to comprehend the simple, instinctive motives of reptiles. In contrast, mammals and birds exhibit self-restraint and consideration for others, allowing for mutual recognition, taming, and domestication, enabling a relatable connection. The remarkable growth of the brain during the Cainozoic period signifies a new level of individual communication and interdependence, foreshadowing the development of human societies. As the period progressed, flora and fauna increasingly resembled modern forms, with clumsy early species like Uintatheres disappearing, replaced by evolutionary lines leading to contemporary animals such as giraffes, camels, horses, elephants, deer, dogs, and big cats. The evolution of the horse, llamas, and camels is particularly well-documented in the geological record.",

        "content": "Naturalists divide the class Mammalia into a number of orders. At the head of these is the order Primates, which includes the lemurs, the monkeys, apes and man. Their classification was based originally upon anatomical resemblances and took no account of any mental qualities. Now the past history of the Primates is one very difficult to decipher in the geological record. They are for the most part animals which live in forests like the lemurs and monkeys or in bare rocky places like the baboons. They are rarely drowned and covered up by sediment, nor are most of them very numerous species, and so they do not figure so largely among the fossils as the ancestors of the horses, camels and so forth do. But we know that quite early in the Cainozoic period, that is to say some forty million years ago or so, primitive monkeys and lemuroid creatures had appeared, poorer in brain and not so specialized as their later successors. The great world summer of the middle Cainozoic period drew at last to an end. It was to follow those other two great summers in the history of life, the summer of the Coal Swamps and the vast summer of the Age of Reptiles. Once more the earth spun towards an ice age. The world chilled, grew milder for a time and chilled again. In the warm past hippopotami had wallowed through a lush sub-tropical vegetation, and a tremendous tiger with fangs like sabres, the sabre-toothed tiger, had hunted its prey where now the journalists of Fleet Street go to and fro. Now came a bleaker age and still bleaker ages. A great weeding and extinction of species occurred. A woolly rhinoceros, adapted to a cold climate, and the mammoth, a big woolly cousin of the elephants, the Arctic musk ox and the reindeer passed across the scene. Then century by century the Arctic ice cap, the wintry death of the great Ice Age, crept southward. In England it came almost down to the Thames, in America it reached Ohio. There would be warmer spells of a few thousand years and relapses towards a bitterer cold. Geologists talk of these wintry phases as the First, Second, Third and Fourth Glacial Ages, and of the interludes as Interglacial periods. We live to-day in a world that is still impoverished and scarred by that terrible winter. The First Glacial Age was coming on 600,000 years ago; the Fourth Glacial Age reached its bitterest some fifty thousand years ago. And it was amidst the snows of this long universal winter that the first man-like beings lived upon our planet. By the middle Cainozoic period there have appeared various apes with many quasi-human attributes of the jaws and leg bones, but it is only as we approach these Glacial Ages that we find traces of creatures that we can speak of as “almost human.” These traces are not bones but implements. In Europe, in deposits of this period, between half a million and a million years old, we find flints and stones that have evidently been chipped intentionally by some handy creature desirous of hammering, scraping or fighting with the sharpened edge. These things have been called “Eoliths” (dawn stones). In Europe there are no bones nor other remains of the creature which made these objects, simply the objects themselves. For all the certainty we have it may have been some entirely un-human but intelligent monkey. But at Trinil in Java, in accumulations of this age, a piece of a skull and various teeth and bones have been found of a sort of ape man, with a brain case bigger than that of any living apes, which seems to have walked erect. This creature is now called Pithecanthropus erectus, the walking ape man, and the little trayful of its bones is the only help our imaginations have as yet in figuring to, ourselves the makers of the Eoliths. It is not until we come to sands that are almost a quarter of a million years old that we find any other particle of a sub- human being. But there are plenty of implements, and they are steadily improving in quality as we read on through the record. They are no longer clumsy Eoliths; they are now shapely instruments made with considerable skill. And they are much bigger than the similar implements afterwards made by true man. Then, in a sandpit at Heidelberg, appears a single quasi-human jaw-bone, a clumsy jaw-bone, absolutely chinless, far heavier than a true human jaw-bone and narrower, so that it is improbable the creature’s tongue could have moved about for articulate speech. On the strength of this jaw-bone, scientific men suppose this creature to have been a heavy, almost human monster, possibly with huge limbs and hands, possibly with a thick felt of hair, and they call it the Heidelberg Man. This jaw-bone is, I think, one of the most tormenting objects in the world to our human curiosity. To see it is like looking through a defective glass into the past and catching just one blurred and tantalizing glimpse of this Thing, shambling through the bleak wilderness, clambering to avoid the sabre- toothed tiger, watching the woolly rhinoceros in the woods. Then before we can scrutinize the monster, he vanishes. Yet the soil is littered abundantly with the indestructible implements he chipped out for his uses. Still more fascinatingly enigmatical are the remains of a creature found at Piltdown in Sussex in a deposit that may indicate an age between a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand years ago, though some authorities would put these particular remains back in time to before the Heidelberg jaw- bone. Here there are the remains of a thick sub-human skull much larger than any existing ape’s, and a chimpanzee-like jaw-bone which may or may not belong to it, and, in addition, a bat-shaped piece of elephant bone evidently carefully manufactured, through which a hole had apparently been bored. There is also the thigh-bone of a deer with cuts upon it like a tally. That is all. What sort of beast was this creature which sat and bored holes in bones? Scientific men have named him Eoanthropus, the Dawn Man. He stands apart from his kindred; a very different being either from the Heidelberg creature or from any living ape. No other vestige like him is known. But the gravels and deposits of from one hundred thousand years onward are increasingly rich in implements of flint and similar stone. And these implements are no longer rude “Eoliths.” The archæologists are presently able to distinguish scrapers, borers, knives, darts, throwing stones and hand axes .... We are drawing very near to man. In our next section we shall have to describe the strangest of all these precursors of humanity, the Neanderthalers, the men who were almost, but not quite, true men. But it may be well perhaps to state quite clearly here that no scientific man supposes either of these creatures, the Heidelberg Man or Eoanthropus, to be direct ancestors of the men of to-day. These are, at the closest, related forms.",
        "target_summary": "Naturalists classify Mammalia into orders, with Primates (lemurs, monkeys, apes, and man) at the top, based on anatomical resemblances. The fossil record for Primates is difficult to decipher because they mostly inhabit forests or rocky areas, making preservation rare. Nevertheless, primitive, less specialized monkeys and lemuroid creatures had emerged around 40 million years ago during the Cainozoic period.\n\nThe expansive \"world summer\" of the middle Cainozoic eventually gave way to a series of global cooling periods and ice ages, mirroring past geological climate shifts. This brought about a significant culling and adaptation of species, with animals like the woolly rhinoceros, mammoth, and reindeer appearing. The Arctic ice cap gradually advanced southward through four major Glacial Ages, interspersed with warmer Interglacial periods. The First Glacial Age began around 600,000 years ago, and the Fourth reached its peak severity about 50,000 years ago, leaving the present world still marked by this \"terrible winter.\"\n\nAmidst this prolonged winter, the first \"man-like beings\" appeared. While apes with quasi-human attributes existed earlier, the earliest evidence for \"almost human\" creatures comes from their implements as the Glacial Ages approached. In Europe, deposits from between half a million and a million years ago contain \"Eoliths\"—flints and stones intentionally chipped for various uses. Initially, the makers of these tools were unknown, as no associated bones were found in Europe. However, in Java, from a similar age, fragments of a skull, teeth, and bones of *Pithecanthropus erectus* (walking ape man) were discovered. This creature had a larger braincase than living apes and appeared to walk erect, making it a possible maker of the Eoliths.\n\nBy about a quarter of a million years ago, implements had significantly improved in skill and size, moving beyond clumsy Eoliths, though few sub-human remains from this period are known. A notable discovery is the \"Heidelberg Man,\" known solely from a single, clumsy, chinless jaw-bone, much heavier and narrower than a human jaw, suggesting a large, almost human creature likely incapable of articulate speech. This jaw offers a brief, tantalizing glimpse into the past. Even more enigmatically, \"Eoanthropus\" (Dawn Man) was found at Piltdown, Sussex, possibly dating between 100,000 and 150,000 years ago (though its age is debated). This discovery included a thick, large sub-human skull, a chimpanzee-like jaw (whose connection to the skull is debated), a carefully manufactured elephant bone with a bored hole, and a tallied deer bone. Eoanthropus is considered a distinct being, different from Heidelberg Man or any living ape.\n\nFrom 100,000 years onward, gravels and deposits show an increasing abundance of refined flint and stone implements, including scrapers, borers, knives, and hand axes, indicating a closer proximity to true man. However, it is crucial to note that scientists do not consider either Heidelberg Man or Eoanthropus to be direct ancestors of modern humans; they are seen as closely related forms. The text indicates that the next discussion will focus on the Neanderthalers, who were precursors to humanity, \"almost, but not quite, true men.\"",

        "title": "THE NEANDERTHALER AND THE RHODESIAN MAN",
        "content": "About fifty or sixty thousand years ago, before the climax of the Fourth Glacial Age, there lived a creature on earth so like a man that until a few years ago its remains were considered to be altogether human. We have skulls and bones of it and a great accumulation of the large implements it made and used. It made fires. It sheltered in caves from the cold. It probably dressed skins roughly and wore them. It was right-handed as men are. Yet now the ethnologists tell us these creatures were not true men. They were of a different species of the same genus. They had heavy protruding jaws and great brow ridges above the eyes and very low foreheads. Their thumbs were not opposable to the fingers as men’s are; their necks were so poised that they could not turn back their heads and look up to the sky. They probably slouched along, head down and forward. Their chinless jaw-bones resemble the Heidelberg jaw-bone and are markedly unlike human jaw-bones. And there were great differences from the human pattern in their teeth. Their cheek teeth were more complicated in structure than ours, more complicated and not less so; they had not the long fangs of our cheek teeth; and also these quasi-men had not the marked canines (dog teeth) of an ordinary human being. The capacity of their skulls was quite human, but the brain was bigger behind and lower in front than the human brain. Their intellectual faculties were differently arranged. They were not ancestral to the human line. Mentally and physically they were upon a different line from the human line. Skulls and bones of this extinct species of man were found at Neanderthal among other places, and from that place these strange proto-men have been christened Neanderthal Men, or Neanderthalers. They must have endured in Europe for many hundreds or even thousands of years. At that time the climate and geography of our world was very different from what they are at the present time. Europe for example was covered with ice reaching as far south as the Thames and into Central Germany and Russia; there was no Channel separating Britain from France; the Mediterranean and the Red Sea were great valleys, with perhaps a chain of lakes in their deeper portions, and a great inland sea spread from the present Black Sea across South Russia and far into Central Asia. Spain and all of Europe not actually under ice consisted of bleak uplands under a harder climate than that of Labrador, and it was only when North Africa was reached that one would have found a temperate climate. Across the cold steppes of Southern Europe with its sparse arctic vegetation, drifted such hardy creatures as the woolly mammoth, and woolly rhinoceros, great oxen and reindeer, no doubt following the vegetation northward in spring and southward in autumn. Such was the scene through which the Neanderthaler wandered, gathering such subsistence as he could from small game or fruits and berries and roots. Possibly he was mainly a vegetarian, chewing twigs and roots. His level elaborate teeth suggest a largely vegetarian dietary. But we also find the long marrow bones of great animals in his caves, cracked to extract the marrow. His weapons could not have been of much avail in open conflict with great beasts, but it is supposed that he attacked them with spears at difficult river crossings and even constructed pitfalls for them. Possibly he followed the herds and preyed upon any dead that were killed in fights, and perhaps he played the part of jackal to the sabre-toothed tiger which still survived in his day. Possibly in the bitter hardships of the Glacial Ages this creature had taken to attacking animals after long ages of vegetarian adaptation. We cannot guess what this Neanderthal man looked like. He may have been very hairy and very unhuman-looking indeed. It is even doubtful if he went erect. He may have used his knuckles as well as his feet to hold himself up. Probably he went about alone or in small family groups. It is inferred from the structure of his jaw that he was incapable of speech as we understand it. For thousands of years these Neanderthalers were the highest animals that the European area had ever seen; and then some thirty or thirty-five thousand years ago as the climate grew warmer a race of kindred beings, more intelligent, knowing more, talking and co-operating together, came drifting into the Neanderthaler’s world from the south. They ousted the Neanderthalers from their caves and squatting places; they hunted the same food; they probably made war upon their grisly predecessors and killed them off. These newcomers from the south or the east—for at present we do not know their region of origin—who at last drove the Neanderthalers out of existence altogether, were beings of our own blood and kin, the first True Men. Their brain-cases and thumbs and necks and teeth were anatomically the same as our own. In a cave at Cro-Magnon and in another at Grimaldi, a number of skeletons have been found, the earliest truly human remains that are so far known. So it is our race comes into the Record of the Rocks, and the story of mankind begins. The world was growing liker our own in those days though the climate was still austere. The glaciers of the Ice Age were receding in Europe; the reindeer of France and Spain presently gave way to great herds of horses as grass increased upon the steppes, and the mammoth became more and more rare in southern Europe and finally receded northward altogether .... We do not know where the True Men first originated. But in the summer of 1921, an extremely interesting skull was found together with pieces of a skeleton at Broken Hill in South Africa, which seems to be a relic of a third sort of man, intermediate in its characteristics between the Neanderthaler and the human being. The brain-case indicates a brain bigger in front and smaller behind than the Neanderthaler’s, and the skull was poised erect upon the backbone in a quite human way. The teeth also and the bones are quite human. But the face must have been ape-like with enormous brow ridges and a ridge along the middle of the skull. The creature was indeed a true man, so to speak, with an ape- like, Neanderthaler face. This Rhodesian Man is evidently still closer to real men than the Neanderthal Man. This Rhodesian skull is probably only the second of what in the end may prove to be a long list of finds of sub-human species which lived on the earth in the vast interval of time between the beginnings of the Ice Age and the appearance of their common heir, and perhaps their common exterminator, the True Man. The Rhodesian skull itself may not be very ancient. Up to the time of publishing this book there has been no exact determination of its probable age. It may be that this sub-human creature survived in South Africa until quite recent times.",
        "target_summary": "Around 50,000-60,000 years ago, prior to the peak of the Fourth Glacial Age, lived Neanderthal Man. Initially mistaken for humans due to their remains and sophisticated implements, ethnologists now classify them as a distinct, related species. They utilized fire, sought shelter in caves, probably dressed skins, and were right-handed.\n\nPhysically, Neanderthals had heavy protruding jaws, pronounced brow ridges, and low foreheads. Their thumbs were not opposable like ours, and their neck structure restricted their ability to look upwards, leading to a probable slouched, head-down posture. Their chinless jawbones and distinctive teeth—more complex cheek teeth, without human-like long fangs or prominent canines—further marked them as distinct. Though their skull capacity matched humans', their brain was structured differently, larger in the rear and lower in the front, suggesting unique intellectual faculties. They represented a distinct evolutionary path, not ancestral to modern humans.\n\nThe climate and geography during Neanderthal occupation in Europe were drastically different. Much of Europe was glaciated, reaching as far south as the Thames, with Britain connected to France. The Mediterranean and Red Sea were deep valleys, and a great inland sea stretched across South Russia into Central Asia. Un-glaciated parts of Europe were bleak, cold uplands, supporting arctic megafauna like woolly mammoths, rhinoceroses, and migrating reindeer.\n\nThey subsisted on small game, fruits, berries, and roots, with their elaborate teeth suggesting a primarily vegetarian diet. However, cracked marrow bones of large animals in their caves indicate meat consumption, likely from scavenging carcasses or hunting megafauna with spears at river crossings or pitfalls, especially given the harsh Glacial Age conditions. Their exact appearance is unknown; they may have been very hairy and possibly did not walk fully erect, perhaps using knuckles. They likely lived alone or in small family groups, and their jaw structure implies an inability for complex speech. For millennia, Neanderthalers were the most advanced beings in Europe.\n\nApproximately 30,000-35,000 years ago, with a warming climate, more intelligent, communicative, and cooperative \"True Men\"—our direct ancestors—migrated into Europe from the south. These newcomers ousted Neanderthals from their territories, competed for resources, and likely waged war against them, ultimately leading to their extinction. These earliest anatomically modern humans, typified by remains from Cro-Magnon and Grimaldi, shared our exact physical traits.\n\nWhile the precise origin of True Men is unknown, the 1921 discovery of Rhodesian Man in South Africa presented a \"third sort of man,\" an intermediate species between Neanderthals and modern humans. Its skull indicated a brain larger in the front and smaller in the rear than a Neanderthal's, poised erectly like a human's, with human-like teeth and bones. Yet, its face retained ape-like features, including massive brow ridges and a skull ridge. Rhodesian Man is considered closer to modern humans than Neanderthals, potentially one of several sub-human species bridging the gap between the Ice Age's start and True Man's appearance. Its age is undetermined, possibly surviving into relatively recent times.",

        "title": "THE FIRST TRUE MEN",
        "content": "The earliest signs and traces at present known to science, of a humanity which is indisputably kindred with ourselves, have been found in western Europe and particularly in France and Spain. Bones, weapons, scratchings upon bone and rock, carved fragments of bone, and paintings in caves and upon rock surfaces dating. it is supposed. from 30,000 years ago or more, have been discovered in both these countries. Spain is at present the richest country in the world in these first relics of our real human ancestors. Of course our present collections of these things are the merest beginnings of the accumulations we may hope for in the future, when there are searchers enough to make a thorough examination of all possible sources and when other countries in the world, now inaccessible to archæologists, have been explored in some detail. The greater part of Africa and Asia has never even been traversed yet by a trained observer interested in these matters and free to explore, and we must be very careful therefore not to conclude that the early true men were distinctively inhabitants of western Europe or that they first appeared in that region. In Asia or Africa or submerged beneath the sea of to-day there may be richer and much earlier deposits of real human remains than anything that has yet come to light. I write in Asia or Africa, and I do not mention America because so far there have been no finds at all of any of the higher Primates, either of great apes, sub-men, Neanderthalers nor early true men. This development of life seems to have been an exclusively old world development, and it was only apparently at the end of the Old Stone Age that human beings first made their way across the land connexion that is now cut by Behring Straits, into the American continent. These first real human beings we know of in Europe appear already to have belonged to one or other of at least two very distinct races. One of these races was of a very high type indeed; it was tall and big brained. One of the women’s skulls found exceeds in capacity that of the average man of to-day. One of the men’s skeletons is over six feet in height. The physical type resembled that of the North American Indian. From the Cro-Magnon cave in which the first skeletons were found these people have been called Cro-Magnards. They were savages, but savages of a high order. The second race, the race of the Grimaldi cave remains, was distinctly negroid in its characters. Its nearest living affinities are the Bushmen and Hottentots of South Africa. It is interesting to find at the very outset of the known human story, that mankind was already racially divided into at least two main varieties; and one is tempted to such unwarrantable guesses as that the former race was probably brownish rather than black and that it came from the East or North, and that the latter was blackish rather than brown and came from the equatorial south. And these savages of perhaps forty thousand years ago were so human that they pierced shells to make necklaces, painted themselves, carved images of bone and stone, scratched figures on rocks and bones, and painted rude but often very able sketches of beasts and the like upon the smooth walls of caves and upon inviting rock surfaces. They made a great variety of implements, much smaller in scale and finer than those of the Neanderthal men. We have now in our museums great quantities of their implements, their statuettes, their rock drawings and the like. The earliest of them were hunters. Their chief pursuit was the wild horse, the little bearded pony of that time. They followed it as it moved after pasture. And also they followed the bison. They knew the mammoth, because they have left us strikingly effective pictures of that creature. To judge by one rather ambiguous drawing they trapped and killed it. They hunted with spears and throwing stones. They do not seem to have had the bow, and it is doubtful if they had yet learnt to tame any animals. They had no dogs. There is one carving of a horse’s head and one or two drawings that suggest a bridled horse, with a twisted skin or tendon round it. But the little horses of that age and region could not have carried a man, and if the horse was domesticated it was used as a led horse. It is doubtful and improbable that they had yet learnt the rather unnatural use of animal’s milk as food. They do not seem to have erected any buildings though they may have had tents of skins, and though they made clay figures they never rose to the making of pottery. Since they had no cooking implements their cookery must have been rudimentary or nonexistent. They knew nothing of cultivation and nothing of any sort of basket work or woven cloth. Except for their robes of skin or fur they were naked painted savages. These earliest known men hunted the open steppes of Europe for a hundred centuries perhaps, and then slowly drifted and changed before a change of climate. Europe, century by century, was growing milder and damper. Reindeer receded northward and eastward, and bison and horse followed. The steppes gave way to forests, and red deer took the place of horse and bison. There is a change in the character of the implements with this change in their application. River and lake fishing becomes of great importance to men, and fine implements of bone increased. “The bone needles of this age,” says de Mortillet, “are much superior to those of later, even historical times, down to the Renaissance. The Romans, for example, never had needles comparable to those of this epoch.” Almost fifteen or twelve thousand years ago a fresh people drifted into the south of Spain, and left very remarkable drawings of themselves upon exposed rock faces there. These were the Azilians (named from the Mas d’Azil cave). They had the bow; they seem to have worn feather headdresses; they drew vividly; but also they had reduced their drawings to a sort of symbolism—a man for instance would be represented by a vertical dab with two or three horizontal dabs—that suggest the dawn of the writing idea. Against hunting sketches there are often marks like tallies. One drawing shows two men smoking out a bees’ nest. These are the latest of the men that we call Palæolithic (Old Stone Age) because they had only chipped implements. By ten or twelve thousand years a new sort of life has dawned in Europe, men have learnt not only to chip but to polish and grind stone implements, and they have begun cultivation. The Neolithic Age (New Stone Age) was beginning. It is interesting to note that less than a century ago there still survived in a remote part of the world, in Tasmania, a race of human beings at a lower level of physical and intellectual development than any of these earliest races of mankind who have left traces in Europe. These people had long ago been cut off by geographical changes from the rest of the species, and from stimulation and improvement. They seem to have degenerated rather than developed. They lived a base life subsisting upon shellfish and small game. They had no habitations but only squatting places. They were real men of our species, but they had neither the manual dexterity nor the artistic powers of the first true men.",
        "target_summary": "The earliest known, undisputed human traces, dating back over 30,000 years, have been found predominantly in Western Europe, particularly France and Spain. These relics, including bones, tools, and various forms of art (scratchings, carvings, cave paintings), indicate Spain is currently the richest site for these early ancestors. However, scientists caution against assuming Western Europe as the exclusive origin, as vast regions of Africa and Asia remain largely unexplored, potentially holding much older or richer deposits. The Americas, conversely, show no evidence of higher primates until human migration much later, at the end of the Old Stone Age, across the Bering Strait.\n\nEarly humans in Europe were already racially diverse, comprising at least two distinct groups. The Cro-Magnards were tall, large-brained, resembling North American Indians, and were sophisticated savages. The Grimaldi people, on the other hand, displayed negroid characteristics, akin to modern Bushmen and Hottentots. These early people, roughly 40,000 years ago, exhibited remarkably human behaviors: they crafted necklaces from shells, painted their bodies, created bone and stone carvings, and produced skilled cave paintings of animals. Their tools were varied, smaller, and finer than those of Neanderthals. They were hunters, primarily pursuing wild horses, bison, and mammoths using spears and throwing stones, but they likely lacked bows, domesticated animals (including dogs), or the knowledge of using animal milk. They had rudimentary or no cooking methods, no permanent dwellings (though possibly skin tents), and did not make pottery, practice agriculture, or weave.\n\nEurope's climate gradually became milder and damper over centuries, transforming steppes into forests. This environmental shift led to the northward and eastward retreat of reindeer, bison, and horses, which were replaced by red deer. This change spurred new hunting practices, with river and lake fishing gaining importance, and the development of exceptionally fine bone implements, such as needles superior to those found even in later historical periods.\n\nAround 15,000 to 12,000 years ago, the Azilians, a new group, arrived in Southern Spain. They were notable for using bows, possibly feather headdresses, and creating vivid yet symbolic rock drawings that suggest the dawn of writing. These Azilians represent the latest period of the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), characterized by chipped stone tools. Approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, Europe transitioned into the Neolithic (New Stone Age), marked by the advent of polished and ground stone implements and the beginning of agriculture.\n\nIn stark contrast to these developing European cultures, a race of human beings in Tasmania, isolated by geographical changes until less than a century ago, survived at a significantly lower level of physical and intellectual development. These Tasmanians, subsisting on shellfish and small game, lacked permanent habitations, manual dexterity, and artistic capabilities comparable to the earliest true men in Europe, suggesting a process of degeneration rather than development.",

Recently the science of psycho-analysis, which analyzes the way in which the egotistic and passionate impulses of the child are restrained, suppressed, modified or overlaid, to adapt them to the needs of social life, seems to have thrown a considerable amount of light upon the history of primitive society; and another fruitful source of suggestion has been the study of the ideas and customs of such contemporary savages as still survive. Again there is a sort of mental fossilization which we find in folk-lore and the deep-lying irrational superstitions and prejudices that still survive among modern civilized people. And finally we have in the increasingly numerous pictures, statues, carvings, symbols and the like, as we draw near to our own time, clearer and clearer indications of what man found interesting and worthy of record and representation. Primitive man probably thought very much as a child thinks, that is to say in a series of imaginative pictures. He conjured up images or images presented themselves to his mind, and he acted in accordance with the emotions they aroused. So a child or an uneducated person does to-day. Systematic thinking is apparently a comparatively late development in human experience; it has not played any great part in human life until within the last three thousand years. And even to-day those who really control and order their thoughts are but a small minority of mankind. Most of the world still lives by imagination and passion. Probably the earliest human societies, in the opening stages of the true human story, were small family groups. Just as the flocks and herds of the earlier mammals arose out of families which remained together and multiplied, so probably did the earliest tribes. But before this could happen a certain restraint upon the primitive egotisms of the individual had to be established. The fear of the father and respect for the mother had to be extended into adult life, and the natural jealousy of the old man of the group for the younger males as they grew up had to be mitigated. The mother on the other hand was the natural adviser and protector of the young. Human social life grew up out of the reaction between the crude instinct of the young to go off and pair by themselves as they grew up, on the one hand, and the dangers and disadvantages of separation on the other. An anthropological writer of great genius, J. J. Atkinson, in his Primal Law, has shown how much of the customary law of savages, the Tabus, that are so remarkable a fact in tribal life, can be ascribed to such a mental adjustment of the needs of the primitive human animal to a developing social life, and the later work of the psycho- analysts has done much to confirm his interpretation of these possibilities. Some speculative writers would have us believe that respect and fear of the Old Man and the emotional reaction of the primitive savage to older protective women, exaggerated in dreams and enriched by fanciful mental play, played a large part in the beginnings of primitive religion and in the conception of gods and goddesses. Associated with this respect for powerful or helpful personalities was a dread and exaltation of such personages after their deaths, due to their reappearance in dreams. It was easy to believe they were not truly dead but only fantastically transferred to a remoteness of greater power. The dreams, imaginations and fears of a child are far more vivid and real than those of a modern adult, and primitive man was always something of a child. He was nearer to the animals also, and he could suppose them to have motives and reactions like his own. He could imagine animal helpers, animal enemies, animal gods. One needs to have been an imaginative child oneself to realize again how important, significant, portentous or friendly, strangely shaped rocks, lumps of wood, exceptional trees or the like may have appeared to the men of the Old Stone Age, and how dream and fancy would create stories and legends about such things that would become credible as they told them. Some of these stories would be good enough to remember and tell again. The women would tell them to the children and so establish a tradition. To this day most imaginative children invent long stories in which some favourite doll or animal or some fantastic semi-human being figures as the hero, and primitive man probably did the same—with a much stronger disposition to believe his hero real. For the very earliest of the true men that we know of were probably quite talkative beings. In that way they have differed from the Neanderthalers and had an advantage over them. The Neanderthaler may have been a dumb animal. Of course the primitive human speech was probably a very scanty collection of names, and may have been eked out with gestures and signs. There is no sort of savage so low as not to have a kind of science of cause and effect. But primitive man was not very critical in his associations of cause with effect; he very easily connected an effect with something quite wrong as its cause. “You do so and so,” he said, “and so and so happens.” You give a child a poisonous berry and it dies. You eat the heart of a valiant enemy and you become strong. There we have two bits of cause and effect association, one true one false. We call the system of cause and effect in the mind of a savage, Fetish; but Fetish is simply savage science. It differs from modern science in that it is totally unsystematic and uncritical and so more frequently wrong. In many cases it is not difficult to link cause and effect, in many others erroneous ideas were soon corrected by experience; but there was a large series of issues of very great importance to primitive man, where he sought persistently for causes and found explanations that were wrong but not sufficiently wrong nor so obviously wrong as to be detected. It was a matter of great importance to him that game should be abundant or fish plentiful and easily caught, and no doubt he tried and believed in a thousand charms, incantations and omens to determine these desirable results. Another great concern of his was illness and death. Occasionally infections crept through the land and men died of them. Occasionally men were stricken by illness and died or were enfeebled without any manifest cause. This too must have given the hasty, emotional mind of primitive man much feverish exercise. Dreams and fantastic guesses made him blame this, or appeal for help to that man or beast or thing. He had the child’s aptitude for fear and panic. Quite early in the little human tribe, older, steadier minds sharing the fears, sharing the imaginations, but a little more forceful than the others, must have asserted themselves, to advise, to prescribe, to command. This they declared unpropitious and that imperative, this an omen of good and that an omen of evil. The expert in Fetish, the Medicine Man, was the first priest. He exhorted, he interpreted dreams, he warned, he performed the complicated hocus pocus that brought luck or averted calamity. Primitive religion was not so much what we now call religion as practice and observance, and the early priest dictated what was indeed an arbitrary primitive practical science.",
        "target_summary": "The text speculates on the mentality of early humans (around 40,000 years ago), a period before agriculture or writing, which must be understood through inference and guesswork. Sources for reconstructing this primitive mindset include psycho-analysis (studying how childhood impulses adapt to social life), examining contemporary indigenous societies, analyzing \"mental fossilization\" found in folklore and superstitions, and interpreting early art like pictures and carvings.\n\nPrimitive man likely thought much like a child, relying on imaginative pictures and acting based on the emotions they evoked, as systematic thinking is a relatively late human development that remains uncommon. Early human societies probably began as small family groups, similar to animal herds. The development of social life required individuals to restrain primitive egotism, extending the fear of the father and respect for the mother into adulthood, and mitigating jealousy among males. Social structure emerged from the balance between the instinct to pair off independently and the disadvantages of separation. Anthropologist J. J. Atkinson's \"Primal Law\" attributed many customary taboos to this social adjustment, a view supported by later psycho-analytic work.\n\nSome speculate that respect and fear for powerful elders, particularly protective women, exaggerated by dreams and imagination, played a significant role in the origins of primitive religion and the concept of gods. Dreams of deceased figures contributed to beliefs that they were not truly dead but had ascended to greater power. Primitive man, with a child-like vividness of dreams and fears, and a closeness to animals, attributed human motives to them, imagining animal helpers, enemies, or gods. They imbued natural objects like strangely shaped rocks or trees with significance, creating and transmitting stories and legends, much like imaginative children do today, but with a stronger belief in their reality. Early humans were likely quite talkative, unlike Neanderthals, though their speech was probably limited, supplemented by gestures.\n\nPrimitive man possessed a \"savage science\" called Fetish, which involved understanding cause and effect, but it was uncritical and unsystematic, frequently leading to erroneous conclusions. While some cause-effect links were clear or corrected by experience, many crucial issues (like game abundance, illness, or death) prompted persistent, incorrect explanations such as charms, incantations, or omens. Illness and death particularly incited fear and panic, leading to blaming or appealing to various entities. Within early tribes, older, steadier minds emerged to advise, prescribe, and command, interpreting omens. The \"expert in Fetish,\" or Medicine Man, thus became the first priest, dictating what was essentially an arbitrary primitive practical science, more focused on practice and observance than modern religion.",

        "title": "THE BEGINNINGS OF CULTIVATION",
        "content": "We are still very ignorant about the beginnings of cultivation and settlement in the world although a vast amount of research and speculation has been given to these matters in the last fifty years. All that we can say with any confidence at present is that somewhen about 15,000 and 12,000 B.C. while the Azilian people were in the south of Spain and while the remnants of the earlier hunters were drifting northward and eastward, somewhere in North Africa or Western Asia or in that great Mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters of the Mediterranean sea, there were people who, age by age, were working out two vitally important things; they were beginning cultivation and they were domesticating animals. They were also beginning to make, in addition to the chipped implements of their hunter forebears, implements of polished stone. They had discovered the possibility of basketwork and roughly woven textiles of plant fibre, and they were beginning to make a rudely modelled pottery. They were entering upon a new phase in human culture, the Neolithic phase (New Stone Age) as distinguished from the Palæolithic (Old Stone) phase of the Cro-Magnards, the Grimaldi people, the Azilians and their like. [1] Slowly these Neolithic people spread over the warmer parts of the world; and the arts they had mastered, the plants and animals they had learnt to use, spread by imitation and acquisition even more widely than they did. By 10,000 B.C., most of mankind was at the Neolithic level. Now the ploughing of land, the sowing of seed, the reaping of harvest, threshing and grinding, may seem the most obviously reasonable steps to a modern mind just as to a modern mind it is a commonplace that the world is round. What else could you do? people will ask. What else can it be? But to the primitive man of twenty thousand years ago neither of the systems of action and reasoning that seem so sure and manifest to us to-day were at all obvious. He felt his way to effectual practice through a multitude of trials and misconceptions, with fantastic and unnecessary elaborations and false interpretations at every turn. Somewhere in the Mediterranean region, wheat grew wild; and man may have learnt to pound and then grind up its seeds for food long before he learnt to sow. He reaped before he sowed. And it is a very remarkable thing that throughout the world wherever there is sowing and harvesting there is still traceable the vestiges of a strong primitive association of the idea of sowing with the idea of a blood sacrifice, and primarily of the sacrifice of a human being. The study of the original entanglement of these two things is a profoundly attractive one to the curious mind; the interested reader will find it very fully developed in that monumental work, Sir J. G. Frazer’s Golden Bough. It was an entanglement, we must remember, in the childish, dreaming, myth-making primitive mind; no reasoned process will explain it. But in that world of 12,000 to 20,000 years ago, it would seem that whenever seed time came round to the Neolithic peoples there was a human sacrifice. And it was not the sacrifice of any mean or outcast person; it was the sacrifice usually of a chosen youth or maiden, a youth more often who was treated with profound deference and even worship up to the moment of his immolation. He was a sort of sacrificial god-king, and all the details of his killing had become a ritual directed by the old, knowing men and sanctioned by the accumulated usage of ages. At first primitive men, with only a very rough idea of the seasons, must have found great difficulty in determining when was the propitious moment for the seed-time sacrifice and the sowing. There is some reason for supposing that there was an early stage in human experience when men had no idea of a year. The first chronology was in lunar months; it is supposed that the years of the Biblical patriarchs are really moons, and the Babylonian calendar shows distinct traces of an attempt to reckon seed time by taking thirteen lunar months to see it round. This lunar influence upon the calendar reaches down to our own days. If usage did not dull our sense of its strangeness we should think it a very remarkable thing indeed that the Christian Church does not commemorate the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ on the proper anniversaries but on dates that vary year by year with the phases of the moon. It may be doubted whether the first agriculturalists made any observation of the stars. It is more likely that stars were first observed by migratory herdsmen, who found them a convenient mark of direction. But once their use in determining seasons was realized, their importance to agriculture became very great. The seed-time sacrifice was linked up with the southing or northing of some prominent star. A myth and worship of that star was for primitive man an almost inevitable consequence. It is easy to see how important the man of knowledge and experience, the man who knew about the blood sacrifice and the stars, became in this early Neolithic world. The fear of uncleanness and pollution, and the methods of cleansing that were advisable, constituted another source of power for the knowledgeable men and women. For there have always been witches as well as wizards, and priestesses as well as priests. The early priest was really not so much a religious man as a man of applied science. His science was generally empirical and often bad; he kept it secret from the generality of men very jealously; but that does not alter the fact that his primary function was knowledge and that his primary use was a practical use. Twelve or fifteen thousand years ago, in all the warm and fairly well-watered parts of the Old World these Neolithic human communities, with their class and tradition of priests and priestesses and their cultivated fields and their development of villages and little walled cities, were spreading. Age by age a drift and exchange of ideas went on between these communities. Eliot Smith and Rivers have used the term “Heliolithic culture” for the culture of these first agricultural peoples. “Heliolithic” (Sun and Stone) is not perhaps the best possible word to use for this, but until scientific men give us a better one we shall have to use it. Originating somewhere in the Mediterranean and western Asiatic area, it spread age by age eastward and from island to island across the Pacific until it may even have reached America and mingled with the more primitive ways of living of the Mongoloid immigrants coming down from the North. Wherever the brownish people with the Heliolithic culture went they took with them all or most of a certain group of curious ideas and practices. Some of them are such queer ideas that they call for the explanation of the mental expert. They made pyramids and great mounds, and set up great circles of big stones, perhaps to facilitate the astronomical observation of the priests; they made mummies of some or all of their dead; they tattooed and circumcized; they had the old custom, known as the couvade, of sending the father to bed and rest when a child was born, and they had as a luck symbol the well-known Swastika. If we were to make a map of the world with dots to show how far these group practices have left their traces, we should make a belt along the temperate and sub-tropical coasts of the world from Stonehenge and Spain across the world to Mexico and Peru. But Africa below the equator, north central Europe, and north Asia would show none of these dottings; there lived races who were developing along practically independent lines.",
        "target_summary": "Despite extensive recent research, our understanding of the origins of cultivation and settlement remains limited. It is confidently estimated that between 15,000 and 12,000 B.C., possibly in North Africa, Western Asia, or a now-submerged Mediterranean valley, people were independently developing two crucial advancements: cultivation and animal domestication. Concurrently, they began crafting implements of polished stone, alongside their predecessors' chipped tools, and pioneered basketwork, woven textiles from plant fibers, and rudimentary pottery. This period marked the transition to the Neolithic phase, or New Stone Age, distinguished from the earlier Paleolithic era of hunter-gatherers like the Cro-Magnards.\n\nThese Neolithic practices and the associated knowledge spread gradually across the warmer regions of the world, with their innovations disseminating even more broadly through imitation and acquisition. By 10,000 B.C., a significant portion of humanity had adopted the Neolithic lifestyle. While modern minds view agricultural steps like ploughing, sowing, and reaping as self-evident, these practices were far from obvious to primitive humans twenty millennia ago. They were painstakingly discovered through countless trials, errors, and often elaborate, false interpretations. For instance, wheat, growing wild in the Mediterranean region, was likely processed by pounding and grinding before the act of sowing was conceived; thus, reaping preceded sowing.\n\nA remarkable and persistent global phenomenon is the strong primitive association between sowing and the idea of blood sacrifice, particularly human sacrifice, a topic extensively explored in Sir J. G. Frazer’s *Golden Bough*. This connection, rooted in the primitive, myth-making mind rather than reasoned process, suggests that Neolithic peoples 12,000 to 20,000 years ago routinely performed human sacrifices at seed time. The victim was typically a chosen youth or maiden, often a youth, treated with profound reverence up to the moment of immolation, akin to a sacrificial god-king. The entire killing process was an elaborate ritual, guided by elders and sanctioned by ancient custom.\n\nInitially, primitive communities struggled to determine the precise, propitious moment for the seed-time sacrifice and sowing due to a rudimentary grasp of seasons, possibly even lacking a concept of a \"year.\" Early chronology often relied on lunar months, with vestiges of this system apparent in ancient Babylonian calendars and even the varying dates of Christian Easter. While migratory herdsmen likely first observed stars for direction, their critical importance to agriculture for seasonal determination soon became evident. The seed-time sacrifice became linked to the heliacal rising or setting of prominent stars, leading almost inevitably to myth-making and the worship of these celestial bodies.\n\nThis growing body of specialized knowledge—concerning blood sacrifice, celestial timing, and even matters of ritual purity and cleansing—elevated the status of knowledgeable individuals (priests, priestesses, wizards, witches). Early priests functioned less as religious figures and more as practical \"applied scientists.\" Their empirical, often secretive knowledge, while sometimes flawed, served crucial practical purposes.\n\nOver time, these Neolithic human communities, characterized by their cultivated fields, developing villages, small walled cities, and a distinct class of priests and priestesses, expanded across the warm, well-watered parts of the Old World. Ideas and practices continuously exchanged between these communities. Eliot Smith and Rivers termed this widespread culture \"Heliolithic\" (Sun and Stone). Originating in the Mediterranean and Western Asiatic region, it spread eastward, island-to-island across the Pacific, potentially reaching America and blending with existing cultures.\n\nThis Heliolithic culture disseminated a unique set of practices and beliefs: the construction of pyramids, great mounds, and large stone circles (perhaps for astronomical observation); mummification of the dead; tattooing and circumcision; the custom of couvade (father resting after childbirth); and the use of the Swastika as a luck symbol. The geographical spread of these shared practices forms a distinct belt along the temperate and sub-tropical coasts of the world, from regions like Stonehenge and Spain to Mexico and Peru. However, areas such as Africa below the equator, north-central Europe, and north Asia show little evidence of these traits, indicating independent cultural development in those regions.",

        "title": "PRIMITIVE NEOLITHIC CIVILIZATIONS",
        "content": "About 10,000 B.C. the geography of the world was very similar in its general outline to that of the world to-day. It is probable that by that time the great barrier across the Straits of Gibraltar that had hitherto banked back the ocean waters from the Mediterranean valley had been eaten through, and that the Mediterranean was a sea following much the same coastlines as it does now. The Caspian Sea was probably still far more extensive than it is at present, and it may have been continuous with the Black Sea to the north of the Caucasus Mountains. About this great Central Asian sea lands that are now steppes and deserts were fertile and habitable. Generally it was a moister and more fertile world. European Russia was much more a land of swamp and lake than it is now, and there may still have been a land connexion between Asia and America at Behring Straits. It would have been already possible at that time to have distinguished the main racial divisions of mankind as we know them to-day. Across the warm temperate regions of this rather warmer and better-wooded world, and along the coasts, stretched the brownish peoples of the Heliolithic culture, the ancestors of the bulk of the living inhabitants of the Mediterranean world, of the Berbers, the Egyptians and of much of the population of South and Eastern Asia. This great race had of course a number of varieties. The Iberian or Mediterranean or “dark-white” race of the Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, the “Hamitic” peoples which include the Berbers and Egyptians, the Dravidians; the darker people of India, a multitude of East Indian people, many Polynesian races and the Maoris are all divisions of various value of this great main mass of humanity. Its western varieties are whiter than its eastern. In the forests of central and northern Europe a more blonde variety of men with blue eyes was becoming distinguishable, branching off from the main mass of brownish people, a variety which many people now speak of as the Nordic race. In the more open regions of northeastern Asia was another differentiation of this brownish humanity in the direction of a type with more oblique eyes, high cheek-bones, a yellowish skin, and very straight black hair, the Mongolian peoples. In South Africa, Australia, in many tropical islands in the south of Asia were remains of the early negroid peoples. The central parts of Africa were already a region of racial intermixture. Nearly all the coloured races of Africa to-day seem to be blends of the brownish peoples of the north with a negroid substratum. We have to remember that human races can all interbreed freely and that they separate, mingle and reunite as clouds do. Human races do not branch out like trees with branches that never come together again. It is a thing we need to bear constantly in mind, this remingling of races at any opportunity. It will save us from many cruel delusions and prejudices if we do so. People will use such a word as race in the loosest manner, and base the most preposterous generalizations upon it. They will speak of a “British” race or of a “European” race. But nearly all the European nations are confused mixtures of brownish, dark-white, white and Mongolian elements. It was at the Neolithic phase of human development that peoples of the Mongolian breed first made their way into America. Apparently they came by way of Behring Straits and spread southward. They found caribou, the American reindeer, in the north and great herds of bison in the south. When they reached South America there were still living the Glyptodon, a gigantic armadillo, and the Megatherium, a monstrous clumsy sloth as high as an elephant. They probably exterminated the latter beast, which was as helpless as it was big. The greater portion of these American tribes never rose above a hunting nomadic Neolithic life. They never discovered the use of iron, and their chief metal possessions were native gold and copper. But in Mexico, Yucatan and Peru conditions existed favourable to settled cultivation, and here about 1000 B.C. or so arose very interesting civilizations of a parallel but different type from the old-world civilization. Like the much earlier primitive civilizations of the old world these communities displayed a great development of human sacrifice about the processes of seed time and harvest; but while in the old world, as we shall see, these primary ideas were ultimately mitigated, complicated and overlaid by others, in America they developed and were elaborated, to a very high degree of intensity. These American civilized countries were essentially priest-ruled countries; their war chiefs and rulers were under a rigorous rule of law and omen. These priests carried astronomical science to a high level of accuracy. They knew their year better than the Babylonians of whom we shall presently tell. In Yucatan they had a kind of writing, the Maya writing, of the most curious and elaborate character. So far as we have been able to decipher it, it was used mainly for keeping the exact and complicated calendars upon which the priests expended their intelligence. The art of the Maya civilization came to a climax about 700 or 800 A.D. The sculptured work of these people amazes the modern observer by its great plastic power and its frequent beauty, and perplexes him by a grotesqueness and by a sort of insane conventionality and intricacy outside the circle of his ideas. There is nothing quite like it in the old world. The nearest approach, and that is a remote one, is found in archaic Indian carvings. Everywhere there are woven feathers and serpents twine in and out. Many Maya inscriptions resemble a certain sort of elaborate drawing made by lunatics in European asylums, more than any other old-world work. It is as if the Maya mind had developed upon a different line from the old-world mind, had a different twist to its ideas, was not, by old-world standards, a rational mind at all. This linking of these aberrant American civilizations to the idea of a general mental aberration finds support in their extraordinary obsession by the shedding of human blood. The Mexican civilization in particular ran blood; it offered thousands of human victims yearly. The cutting open of living victims, the tearing out of the still beating heart, was an act that dominated the minds and lives of these strange priesthoods. The public life, the national festivities all turned on this fantastically horrible act. The ordinary existence of the common people in these communities was very like the ordinary existence of any other barbaric peasantry. Their pottery, weaving and dyeing was very good. The Maya writing was not only carven on stone but written and painted upon skins and the like. The European and American museums contain many enigmatical Maya manuscripts of which at present little has been deciphered except the dates. In Peru there were beginnings of a similar writing but they were superseded by a method of keeping records by knotting cords. A similar method of mnemonics was in use in China thousands of years ago. In the old world before 4000 or 5000 B.C., that is to say three or four thousand years earlier, there were primitive civilizations not unlike these American civilizations; civilizations based upon a temple, having a vast quantity of blood sacrifices and with an intensely astronomical priesthood. But in the old world the primitive civilizations reacted upon one another and developed towards the conditions of our own world. In America these primitive civilizations never progressed beyond this primitive stage. Each of them was in a little world of its own. Mexico it seems knew little or nothing of Peru, until the Europeans came to America. The potato, which was the principal food stuff in Peru, was unknown in Mexico. Age by age these peoples lived and marvelled at their gods and made their sacrifices and died. Maya art rose to high levels of decorative beauty. Men made love and tribes made war. Drought and plenty, pestilence and health, followed one another. The priests elaborated their calendar and their sacrificial ritual through long centuries, but made little progress in other directions.",
        "target_summary": "Around 10,000 B.C., the world's geography largely mirrored today's, with the Mediterranean Sea likely having its modern coastlines after the erosion of the Gibraltar barrier. The Caspian Sea was probably much larger, possibly connected to the Black Sea, making present-day Central Asian steppes fertile. Generally, it was a moister, more fertile world, with a swampier European Russia and a potential land bridge at Bering Straits linking Asia and America.\n\nBy this time, humanity's main racial divisions were distinguishable. The \"brownish peoples\" of the Heliolithic culture populated warm temperate zones and coasts, ancestral to Mediterraneans, Berbers, Egyptians, and many South/East Asians. This broad group included varieties like the Iberian/Mediterranean (\"dark-white\"), Hamitic, Dravidian, East Indian, Polynesian, and Maori peoples, with western types being lighter. In central/northern Europe, a blonde, blue-eyed Nordic race branched off. Northeastern Asia saw the emergence of Mongolian peoples, characterized by oblique eyes, high cheekbones, yellowish skin, and straight black hair. Early negroid populations were found in South Africa, Australia, and tropical Asian islands, while central Africa already exhibited intermixtures of northern brownish peoples with a negroid substratum.\n\nCrucially, human races interbreed freely, separating and remingling like clouds, rather than evolving in isolated, unconnecting branches. This constant intermixing, if understood, prevents \"cruel delusions and prejudices\" that arise from loose definitions of \"race,\" such as \"British\" or \"European\" races, when most European nations are complex blends of various elements.\n\nDuring the Neolithic phase, Mongolian peoples migrated into America via the Bering Straits, spreading south. They encountered caribou and bison, and in South America, coexisted with megafauna like the Glyptodon (gigantic armadillo) and the Megatherium (elephant-sized sloth), likely exterminating the latter. Most American tribes remained nomadic hunters, never discovering iron, and primarily used native gold and copper.\n\nHowever, in Mexico, Yucatan, and Peru, settled cultivation around 1000 B.C. fostered unique civilizations. These priest-ruled societies were intensely focused on human sacrifice for agricultural rituals, a practice that escalated rather than mitigated, unlike in the Old World. Their priests achieved remarkable astronomical accuracy, even surpassing Babylonians in calendar knowledge. Maya civilization, peaking 700-800 A.D., developed an elaborate writing system, mainly for their intricate calendars, carved on stone and painted on skins. Their art was powerfully plastic and beautiful but also strikingly grotesque and conventionally intricate, featuring feathers and serpents, unlike Old World art. The author suggests this distinct mental development, \"aberrant\" by Old World standards, was reflected in their extreme obsession with human blood; Mexican civilization, for instance, offered thousands of human victims annually through public spectacles of tearing out hearts. Despite this, common people led lives similar to other barbaric peasantries, producing quality pottery, weaving, and dyeing. Peruvian record-keeping involved knotted cords, superseding early writing attempts.\n\nUnlike the Old World's primitive civilizations (4000-5000 B.C.) which, though initially similar in temple-based structures, sacrifices, and astronomical priesthoods, developed through mutual interaction, American civilizations remained isolated. Mexico, for example, knew little of Peru, and staples like the potato were not shared. These cultures, despite advancing Maya art and intricate rituals, ultimately stagnated, with priests elaborating calendars and sacrifices over centuries but making little other progress until European arrival.",

        "title": "SUMERIA, EARLY EGYPT AND WRITING",
        "content": "The old world is a wider, more varied stage than the new. By 6000 or 7000 B.C. there were already quasi-civilized communities almost at the Peruvian level, appearing in various fertile regions of Asia and in the Nile valley. At that time north Persia and western Turkestan and south Arabia were all more fertile than they are now, and there are traces of very early communities in these regions. It is in lower Mesopotamia however and in Egypt that there first appear cities, temples, systematic irrigation, and evidences of a social organization rising above the level of a mere barbaric village-town. In those days the Euphrates and Tigris flowed by separate mouths into the Persian Gulf, and it was in the country between them that the Sumerians built their first cities. About the same time, for chronology is still vague, the great history of Egypt was beginning. These Sumerians appear to have been a brownish people with prominent noses. They employed a sort of writing that has been deciphered, and their language is now known. They had discovered the use of bronze and they built great tower-like temples of sun-dried brick. The clay of this country is very fine; they used it to write upon, and so it is that their inscriptions have been preserved to us. They had cattle, sheep, goats and asses, but no horses. They fought on foot, in close formation, carrying spears and shields of skin. Their clothing was of wool and they shaved their heads. Each of the Sumerian cities seems generally to have been an independent state with a god of its own and priests of its own. But sometimes one city would establish an ascendancy over others and exact tribute from their population. A very ancient inscription at Nippur records the “empire,” the first recorded empire, of the Sumerian city of Erech. Its god and its priest-king claimed an authority from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. At first writing was merely an abbreviated method of pictorial record. Even before Neolithic times men were beginning to write. The Azilian rock pictures to which we have already referred show the beginning of the process. Many of them record hunts and expeditions, and in most of these the human figures are plainly drawn. But in some the painter would not bother with head and limbs; he just indicated men by a vertical and one or two transverse strokes. From this to a conventional condensed picture writing was an easy transition. In Sumeria, where the writing was done on clay with a stick, the dabs of the characters soon became unrecognizably unlike the things they stood for, but in Egypt where men painted on walls and on strips of the papyrus reed (the first paper) the likeness to the thing imitated remained. From the fact that the wooden styles used in Sumeria made wedge-shaped marks, the Sumerian writing is called cuneiform (= wedge-shaped). An important step towards writing was made when pictures were used to indicate not the thing represented but some similar thing. In the rebus dear to children of a suitable age, this is still done to-day. We draw a camp with tents and a bell, and the child is delighted to guess that this is the Scotch name Campbell. The Sumerian language was a language made up of accumulated syllables rather like some contemporary Amerindian languages, and it lent itself very readily to this syllabic method of writing words expressing ideas that could not be conveyed by pictures directly. Egyptian writing underwent parallel developments. Later on, when foreign peoples with less distinctly syllabled methods of speech were to learn and use these picture scripts they were to make those further modifications and simplifications that developed at last into alphabetical writing. All the true alphabets of the later world derived from a mixture of the Sumerian cuneiform and the Egyptian hieroglyphic (priest writing). Later in China there was to develop a conventionalized picture writing, but in China it never got to the alphabetical stage. The invention of writing was of very great importance in the development of human societies. It put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuous historical consciousness possible. The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death. It is interesting to note that in ancient Sumeria seals were greatly used. A king or a nobleman or a merchant would have his seal often very artistically carved, and would impress it on any clay document he wished to authorize. So close had civilization got to printing six thousand years ago. Then the clay was dried hard and became permanent. For the reader must remember that in the land of Mesopotamia for countless years, letters, records and accounts were all written on comparatively indestructible tiles. To that fact we owe a great wealth of recovered knowledge. Daily life in those first city lands of the old world must have been very similar in both Egypt and Sumeria. And except for the asses and cattle in the streets it must have been not unlike the life in the Maya cities of America three or four thousand years later. Most of the people in peace time were busy with irrigation and cultivation—except on days of religious festivity. They had no money and no need for it. They managed their small occasional trades by barter. The princes and rulers who alone had more than a few possessions used gold and silver bars and precious stones for any incidental act of trade. The temple dominated life; in Sumeria it was a great towering temple that went up to a roof from which the stars were observed; in Egypt it was a massive building with only a ground floor. In Sumeria the priest ruler was the greatest, most splendid of beings. In Egypt however there was one who was raised above the priests; he was the living incarnation of the chief god of the land, the Pharaoh, the god king. There were few changes in the world in those days; men’s days were sunny, toilsome and conventional. Few strangers came into the land and such as did fared uncomfortably. The priest directed life according to immemorial rules and watched the stars for seed time and marked the omens of the sacrifices and interpreted the warnings of dreams. Men worked and loved and died, not unhappily, forgetful of the savage past of their race and heedless of its future. Sometimes the ruler was benign. Such was Pepi II, who reigned in Egypt for ninety years. Sometimes he was ambitious and took men’s sons to be soldiers and sent them against neighbouring city states to war and plunder, or he made them toil to build great buildings. Such were Cheops and Chephren and Mycerinus, who built those vast sepulchral piles, the pyramids at Gizeh. The largest of these is 450 feet high and the weight of stone in it is 4,883,000 tons. All this was brought down the Nile in boats and lugged into place chiefly by human muscle. Its erection must have exhausted Egypt more than a great war would have done.",
        "target_summary": "The ancient world was geographically diverse, with quasi-civilized communities emerging in fertile regions of Asia and the Nile valley by 6000-7000 B.C. Early settlements also appeared in historically richer areas like north Persia, western Turkestan, and south Arabia. However, it was in lower Mesopotamia and Egypt that true cities, temples, systematic irrigation, and complex social organizations first developed. In Mesopotamia, between the Euphrates and Tigris, the Sumerians built their initial cities, around the same time Egypt's history began.\n\nThe Sumerians were a brownish people with prominent noses, known for their deciphered writing and language. They discovered bronze and constructed large tower-like temples from sun-dried brick. Their fine clay was also used for writing, preserving their inscriptions. They had cattle, sheep, goats, and asses but no horses, fighting on foot with spears and skin shields. Dressed in wool, they shaved their heads. Each Sumerian city typically functioned as an independent state with its own god and priests, though some established ascendancy over others, exacting tribute. An inscription at Nippur records the \"empire\" of Erech, claiming authority from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea, marking the first known empire.\n\nThe invention of writing evolved from simplified pictorial records, predating the Neolithic era as seen in Azilian rock pictures where human figures were reduced to basic strokes. This led to conventional condensed picture writing. In Sumeria, writing on clay with a stick resulted in wedge-shaped marks (cuneiform) that quickly became abstract. In contrast, Egyptian writing on walls and papyrus retained a likeness to the objects represented. A critical development occurred when pictures began to denote sounds rather than objects, a rebus principle, which suited the syllabic Sumerian language. Egyptian writing underwent similar advancements. Later, foreign peoples simplified these pictographic scripts, eventually leading to alphabetical writing, with all true alphabets deriving from a combination of Sumerian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics. China developed its own conventionalized picture writing but never reached the alphabetical stage.\n\nWriting significantly impacted human society by recording agreements, laws, and commandments, enabling the growth of states larger than simple city-states, and fostering a continuous historical consciousness. The authority of a priest or king, represented by their seal, could extend beyond their immediate presence and even survive their death. Sumerians extensively used artistically carved seals on clay documents, a precursor to printing. The durability of Mesopotamian clay tablets preserved a vast amount of ancient knowledge.\n\nDaily life in early Egypt and Sumeria was similar, focusing primarily on irrigation and cultivation, except during religious festivals. There was no money; trade occurred through barter, though rulers used gold, silver, and precious stones for larger transactions. The temple dominated life: in Sumeria, it was a towering structure for star observation, while in Egypt, it was a massive ground-floor building. The Sumerian priest-ruler held supreme authority, whereas in Egypt, the Pharaoh was revered as a living god-king, transcending the priesthood. Life was generally stable, toilsome, and conventional, with few external influences. Priests guided society according to ancient rules, interpreting omens and dreams, and observing stars for agricultural timing. People lived, worked, and died, largely unaware of their past or future. Rulers varied from benign, like Egypt's Pepi II (who reigned for 90 years), to ambitious figures like Cheops, Chephren, and Mycerinus, who compelled vast populations to construct immense pyramids, such as the 450-foot-high Gizeh pyramid containing 4.8 million tons of stone. These monumental constructions, built primarily by human muscle, exhausted Egypt more than a major war.",

        "title": "PRIMITIVE NOMADIC PEOPLES",
        "content": "It was not only in Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley that men were settling down to agriculture and the formation of city states in the centuries between 6000 and 8000 B.C. Wherever there were possibilities of irrigation and a steady all-the-year-round food supply men were exchanging the uncertainties and hardships of hunting and wandering for the routines of settlement. On the upper Tigris a people called the Assyrians were founding cities; in the valleys of Asia Minor and on the Mediterranean shores and islands, there were small communities growing up to civilization. Possibly parallel developments of human life were already going on in favourable regions of India, and China. In many parts of Europe where there were lakes well stocked with fish, little communities of men had long settled in dwellings built on piles over the water, and were eking out agriculture by fishing and hunting. But over much larger areas of the old world no such settlement was possible. The land was too harsh, too thickly wooded or too arid, or the seasons too uncertain for mankind, with only the implements and science of that age to take root. For settlement under the conditions of the primitive civilizations men needed a constant water supply and warmth and sunshine. Where these needs were not satisfied, man could live as a transient, as a hunter following his game, as a herdsman following the seasonal grass, but he could not settle. The transition from the hunting to the herding life may have been very gradual. From following herds of wild cattle or (in Asia) wild horses, men may have come to an idea of property in them, have learnt to pen them into valleys, have fought for them against wolves, wild dogs and other predatory beasts. So while the primitive civilizations of the cultivators were growing up chiefly in the great river valleys, a different way of living, the nomadic life, a life in constant movement to and fro from winter pasture to summer pasture, was also growing up. The nomadic peoples were on the whole hardier than the agriculturalists; they were less prolific and numerous, they had no permanent temples and no highly organized priesthood; they had less gear; but the reader must not suppose that theirs was necessarily a less highly developed way of living on that account. In many ways this free life was a fuller life than that of the tillers of the soil. The individual was more self-reliant; less of a unit in a crowd. The leader was more important; the medicine man perhaps less so. Moving over large stretches of country the nomad took a wider view of life. He touched on the confines of this settled land and that. He was used to the sight of strange faces. He had to scheme and treat for pasture with competing tribes. He knew more of minerals than the folk upon the plough lands because he went over mountain passes and into rocky places. He may have been a better metallurgist. Possibly bronze and much more probably iron smelting were nomadic discoveries. Some of the earliest implements of iron reduced from its ores have been found in Central Europe far away from the early civilizations. On the other hand the settled folk had their textiles and their pottery and made many desirable things. It was inevitable that as the two sorts of life, the agricultural and the nomadic differentiated, a certain amount of looting and trading should develop between the two. In Sumeria particularly which had deserts and seasonal country on either hand it must have been usual to have the nomads camping close to the cultivated fields, trading and stealing and perhaps tinkering, as gipsies do to this day. (But hens they would not steal, because the domestic fowl—an Indian jungle fowl originally was not domesticated by man until about 1000 B.C.) They would bring precious stones and things of metal and leather. If they were hunters they would bring skins. They would get in exchange pottery and beads and glass, garments and suchlike manufactured things. Three main regions and three main kinds of wandering and imperfectly settled people there were in those remote days of the first civilizations in Sumeria and early Egypt. Away in the forests of Europe were the blonde Nordic peoples, hunters and herdsmen, a lowly race. The primitive civilizations saw very little of this race before 1500 B.C. Away on the steppes of eastern Asia various Mongolian tribes, the Hunnish peoples, were domesticating the horse and developing a very wide sweeping habit of seasonal movement between their summer and winter camping places. Possibly the Nordic and Hunnish peoples were still separated from one another by the swamps of Russia and the greater Caspian Sea of that time. For very much of Russia there was swamp and lake. In the deserts, which were growing more arid now, of Syria and Arabia, tribes of a dark white or brownish people, the Semitic tribes, were driving flocks of sheep and goats and asses from pasture to pasture. It was these Semitic shepherds and certain more negroid people from southern Persia, the Elamites, who were the first nomads to come into close contact with the early civilizations. They came as traders and as raiders. Finally there arose leaders among them with bolder imaginations, and they became conquerors. About 2750 B.C. a great Semitic leader, Sargon, had conquered the whole Sumerian land and was master of all the world from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. He was an illiterate barbarian and his people, the Akkadians, learnt the Sumerian writing and adopted the Sumerian language as the speech of the officials and the learned. The empire he founded decayed after two centuries, and after one inundation of Elamites a fresh Semitic people, the Amorites, by degrees established their rule over Sumeria. They made their capital in what had hitherto been a small up-river town, Babylon, and their empire is called the first Babylonian Empire. It was consolidated by a great king called Hammurabi (circa 2100 B.C.) who made the earliest code of laws yet known to history. The narrow valley of the Nile lies less open to nomadic invasion than Mesopotamia, but about the time of Hammurabi occurred a successful Semitic invasion of Egypt and a line of Pharaohs was set up, the Hyksos or “shepherd kings,” which lasted for several centuries. These Semitic conquerors never assimilated themselves with the Egyptians; they were always regarded with hostility as foreigners and barbarians; and they were at last expelled by a popular uprising about 1600 B.C. But the Semites had come into Sumeria for good and all, the two races assimilated and the Babylonian Empire became Semitic in its language and character.",
        "target_summary": "Between 8000 and 6000 B.C., agricultural city-states emerged not only in Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley but also on the upper Tigris (Assyrians), in Asia Minor, and on Mediterranean coasts and islands, with probable parallel developments in India and China. European lake-dwelling communities also combined agriculture with fishing. This global shift to settlement occurred where irrigation and consistent food supplies allowed humans to forsake the uncertainties of hunting and wandering, requiring constant water, warmth, and sunshine.\n\nHowever, vast regions of the Old World were unsuitable for permanent settlement due to harsh, wooded, arid, or uncertain seasonal conditions. Where these needs were lacking, people lived as transients—hunters or herdsmen. The gradual transition from hunting to herding involved developing a sense of property over wild herds and managing them. Thus, alongside settled agricultural civilizations, a nomadic lifestyle evolved, characterized by seasonal movement between pastures.\n\nNomadic peoples, though less numerous and lacking permanent structures or organized priesthoods, were generally hardier and lived a freer, more self-reliant life. Their extensive travel fostered a broader perspective, interaction with diverse cultures, and greater knowledge of minerals, potentially leading to the discovery of bronze and iron smelting, evidenced by early iron implements found in Central Europe. Settled communities, meanwhile, excelled in producing textiles and pottery.\n\nAs settled and nomadic lifestyles diverged, trade and occasional looting became common. Nomads often camped near agricultural fields, exchanging goods like precious stones, metal, leather, and skins for pottery, beads, glass, and textiles. Three significant nomadic groups existed: blonde Nordic hunters/herdsmen in European forests (little contact with early civilizations before 1500 B.C.); Mongolian/Hunnish tribes in Eastern Asian steppes, who domesticated horses and practiced wide seasonal migrations; and dark white/brownish Semitic tribes in the increasingly arid deserts of Syria and Arabia, herding sheep, goats, and asses. The Semites, along with the Elamites, were among the first nomads to closely interact with early civilizations.\n\nThese Semitic and Elamite nomads evolved from traders and raiders into conquerors. Around 2750 B.C., the Semitic leader Sargon established the Akkadian Empire, conquering Sumeria. His people, the Akkadians, adopted Sumerian language and writing. After the Akkadian Empire's decline and an Elamite invasion, another Semitic group, the Amorites, founded the First Babylonian Empire, with its capital at Babylon, consolidated by King Hammurabi (c. 2100 B.C.), who created a famous law code. Around the same time, Semitic Hyksos (\"shepherd kings\") invaded Egypt, ruling for centuries but failing to assimilate before their expulsion around 1600 B.C. In Sumeria, however, Semites largely assimilated, transforming the Babylonian Empire into a Semitic culture.",

        "title": "PHCHNICIAN COMMERCE",
        "content": "Phœnicians Occupations.—Crowded into a small territory, the Phœnicians gained their livelihood mainly from commerce. None of the other peoples of the East—the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, the Assyrians, nor the barbarian tribes of the West (Spaniards, Gauls, Italians) had a navy. The Phœnicians alone in this time dared to navigate. They were the commission merchants of the old world; they went to every people to buy their merchandise and sold them in exchange the commodities of other countries. This traffic was by caravan with the East, by sea with the West. Caravans.—On land the Phœnicians sent caravans in three directions: 1.—Towards Arabia, from which they brought gold, agate, and onyx, incense and myrrh, and the perfumes of Arabia; pearls, spices, ivory, ebony, ostrich plumes and apes from India. 2.—Towards Assyria, whence came cotton and linen cloths, asphalt, precious stones, perfumery, and silk from China. 3.—Towards the Black Sea, where they went to receive horses, slaves, and copper vases made by the mountaineers of the Caucasus. Marine Commerce.—For their sea commerce they built ships from the cedars of Lebanon to be propelled by oars and sails. In their sailing it was not necessary to remain always in sight of the coast, for they knew how to direct their course by the polar star. Bold mariners, they pushed in their little boats to the mouth of the Mediterranean; they ventured even to pass through the strait of Gibraltar or, as the ancients called it, the Pillars of Hercules, and took the ocean course to the shores of England, and perhaps to Norway, Phœnicians in the service of a king of Egypt started in the seventh century B.C. to circumnavigate Africa, and returned, it is said, at the end of three years by the Red Sea. An expedition issuing from Carthage skirted the coast of Africa to the Gulf of Guinea; the commander Hanno wrote an account of the voyage which is still preserved. Commodities.—To civilized peoples the Phœnicians sold the products of their industry. In barbarous countries they went to search for what they could not find in the Orient. On the coast of Greece they gathered shell-fish from which they extracted a red tint, the purple; cloths colored with purple were used among all the peoples of ancient times for garments of kings and great lords. From Spain and Sardinia they brought the silver which the inhabitants took from the mines. Tin was necessary to make bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, but the Orient did not furnish this, and so they sought it even on the coasts of England, in the Isles of Tin (the Cassiterides). In every country they procured slaves. Sometimes they bought them, as lately the slavers bought negroes on the coast of Africa, for all the peoples of this time made commerce in slaves; sometimes they swooped down on a coast, threw themselves on the women and children and carried them off to be retained in their own cities or to be sold abroad; for on occasion they were pirates and did not scruple to plunder strangers. The Secrets Kept by the Phœnicians.—The Phœnicians did not care to have mariners of other peoples come into competition with them. On the return from these far countries they concealed the road which they had travelled. No one in antiquity knew where were the famous Isles of the Cassiterides from which they got their tin. It was by chance that a Greek ship discovered Spain, with which the Phœnicians had traded for centuries. Carthage drowned the foreign merchants whom they found in Sardinia or on the shore of Gibraltar. Once a Carthaginian merchantman, seeing a strange ship following it, was run aground by the pilot that the foreigner might not see where he was going. Colonies.—In the countries where they traded, the Phœnicians founded factories, or branch-houses. They were fortified posts on a natural harbor. There they landed their merchandise, ordinarily cloths, pottery, ornaments, and idols.[40] The natives brought down their commodities and an exchange was made, just as now European merchants do with the negroes of Africa. There were Phœnician markets in Cyprus, in Egypt, and in all the then barbarous countries of the Mediterranean—in Crete, Greece, Sicily, Africa, Malta, Sardinia, on the coasts of Spain at Malaga and Cadiz, and perhaps in Gaul at Monaco. Often around these Phœnician buildings the natives set up their cabins and the mart became a city. The inhabitants adopted the Phœnician gods, and even after the city had become Greek, the cult of the dove-goddess was found there (as in Cythera), that of the god Melkhart (as at Corinth), or of the god with the bull-face that devours human victims (as in Crete). Influence of the Phœnicians.—It is certain that the Phœnicians in founding their trading stations cared only for their own interest. But it came to pass that their colonies contributed to civilization. The barbarians of the West received the cloths, the jewels, the utensils of the peoples of the East who were more civilized, and, receiving them, learned to imitate them. For a long time the Greeks had only vases, jewels, and idols brought by the Phœnicians, and these served them as models. The Phœnicians brought simultaneously from Egypt and from Assyria industry and commodities. The Alphabet.—At the same time they exported their alphabet. The Phœnicians did not invent writing. The Egyptians knew how to write many centuries before them, they even made use of letters each of which expressed its own sound, as in our alphabet. But their alphabet was still encumbered with ancient signs which represented, some a syllable, others an entire word. Doubtless the Phœnicians had need of a simpler system for their books of commerce. They rejected all the syllabic signs and ideographs, preserving only twenty-two letters, each of which marks a sound (or rather an articulation of the language). The other peoples imitated this alphabet of twenty-two letters. Some, like the Jews, wrote from right to left just as the Phœnicians themselves did; others, like the Greeks, from left to right. All have slightly changed the form of the letters, but the Phœnician alphabet is found at the basis of all the alphabets—Hebrew, Lycian, Greek, Italian, Etruscan, Iberian, perhaps even in the runes of the Norse. It is the Phœnicians that taught the world how to write.",

In the 7th century B.C., Phoenicians in Egyptian service reportedly circumnavigated Africa, a three-year voyage via the Red Sea. Another expedition from Carthage explored the African coast to the Gulf of Guinea, documented by commander Hanno.\n\nThe Phoenicians sold their industrial products to civilized societies, while seeking raw materials from less developed regions. They extracted purple dye from Greek shellfish, highly valued for royal garments. They mined silver from Spain and Sardinia, and crucially, sought tin from England's Cassiterides for bronze production. They also engaged in the slave trade, both by purchasing slaves and by pirating, raiding coasts for women and children.\n\nTo protect their commercial dominance, the Phoenicians fiercely guarded their trade routes and sources, concealing destinations like the Cassiterides. They were known to run ships aground or even drown foreign merchants to prevent competitors from discovering their trade secrets.\n\nThroughout their trading territories, the Phoenicians established fortified \"factories\" or branch-houses in natural harbors. These posts facilitated the exchange of their merchandise (cloths, pottery, ornaments, idols) for local commodities. Such Phoenician markets were spread across the Mediterranean in places like Cyprus, Egypt, Crete, Greece, Sicily, Africa, Malta, Sardinia, and Spain. These centers often grew into cities, influencing local cultures and even leading to the adoption of Phoenician gods.\n\nDespite their self-interested motives, Phoenician colonies profoundly contributed to civilization. They introduced Eastern goods, industries, and utensils to the West, inspiring imitation and progress among \"barbarian\" peoples like the Greeks.\n\nMost significantly, the Phoenicians disseminated their simplified alphabet. While not inventing writing (which existed in Egypt), they streamlined the existing system. They discarded syllabic signs and ideographs, retaining a practical 22-letter phonetic alphabet ideal for commerce. This simplified alphabet was subsequently adopted and adapted by numerous cultures, including the Jews (who shared their right-to-left writing direction) and the Greeks. Although letter forms evolved, the Phoenician alphabet forms the foundational basis for many ancient and modern writing systems (e.g., Hebrew, Lycian, Greek, Etruscan, Iberian, and possibly Norse runes), effectively teaching the world how to write.",

        "title": "ANCIENT SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND CONTEMPORARY AMERICA",
        "content": "At the end of the year 1906, while sojourning in Paris, where I had been giving at the Collège de France a course of lectures on Roman history, I received an invitation from Emilio Mitré, the son of the famous Argentine general, to undertake a long expedition to South America. This invitation evoked general surprise. What, my friends asked, was I, the historian of the ancient world, going to do in the newest of new worlds, in ultra-modern countries, in countries without a past and caring only for the future, where industry and agriculture fill the place which for the ancients was occupied by war? Why, if I was willing to leave my studies and my books for one moment, did I not repair to Egypt or the East, the scene of so much of the history which I had recounted, where the Romans have left so many traces of the world which has passed away, and where so many important excavations, tending to enrich history with new documentary evidence, are in progress? I answered my questioners by pointing out that I was22 not a bookworm, whose interest was confined to ancient books and archæological parchments; that life in all its aspects interested me, and that I was, therefore, curious, after devoting so much attention to ancient peoples, to study awhile the most modern of nations, the newest comers in the history of our civilisation. Did my friends suppose that, because I had written a history of Rome, I had pledged myself never again to direct my gaze to modern life? But, though I explained the reason for my voyage in this way, I, no less than my friendly objectors, was convinced at that time that my travels in America would be only a parenthesis in my intellectual life. In other words, I thought that I was going to America in search of an intellectual diversion, hoping for some relaxation for my mind, obsessed for the last ten years by ancient history, in bringing it to bear on an entirely different world. That this diversion would be useful to me, I had no doubt; but not because America might help me to a better understanding of ancient Rome, but because to change every now and again the subject-matter of my studies and to enrich my mind with new impressions always seemed to me one of the most profitable intellectual exercises, especially for a historian to whom a wide experience of human nature is a necessity. To-day, after having made not one, but two journeys to America, after having seen not only the two largest and most flourishing states of South America, but also that North America which, more than all the other states of the New World, represents23 in the eyes of contemporaries the more modern part of our civilisation, the reign of machinery, the empire of business, the rule of money, I am no longer of this opinion. It is my present belief that a journey in the New World is of supreme benefit intellectually to a historian of the ancient world; and that, in order to understand the life and history of Greek or Roman society, it is perhaps just as important to visit the countries of America as Asia Minor or Northern Africa. That is what I said on one of the last days of my stay in the United States to a genial professor of ancient history connected with Cornell University, with whom I was discussing the most famous schools of the present day for the pursuit of historical studies, and the methods adopted in these schools. “Many of you Americans,” I said, “go to European universities to study ancient history. It seems to me that you might well invite many European professors to come and go through a finishing course in America, studying not only in libraries but in the live world, and observing what happens in American society. Nobody is in a better position than are you to understand ancient society.” My remark may seem at first sight a paradox. But it is no paradox, if one goes to the root of the problem. For what we, men of the twentieth century, call ancient civilisations, were really, when they flourished, new and young civilisations, with but few centuries of history behind them; and so are the American civilisations of the present day. For this reason, we find in ancient24 civilisations, on however much reduced a scale, many phenomena which are now peculiar to American social systems; while we should look for them in vain in European civilisation, which has more right to call itself ancient civilisation than have the civilisations of Greece and of Rome. This I propose briefly to prove. One of the social phenomena which are most characteristic of North America, but which would be looked for in vain in Europe, is the munificence of the donations of wealthy men to the public. Families of great wealth in America nowadays feel it incumbent on them, as a social duty, to spend a part of their substance on the people; to encourage education and culture, to bestow benefactions, to help the more needy classes, and to assist with their purses the public authorities in the execution of their functions. In Europe, the case is different. Large fortunes may be numerous, but they are kept more in the background than in America. Rich men are much more selfish in the enjoyment of their riches. Even the richest are, as a rule, content to leave some small sum in their wills to the poor, or to some educational institution. But donations in excess of four thousand pounds are rare, and make a great stir. It is for this reason that certain sections of society in Europe accuse the upper classes of selfishness and hold up before them American generosity as an example to follow. But this censure is exaggerated, for the times and the social conditions are different in Europe. The history of the ancient world shows that this25 generosity on the part of the rich is a phenomenon peculiar to a certain stage in the development of society, which recurs in all flourishing and prosperous, but as yet not very ancient, societies. In these, some of the public functions are assumed by the rich, because the State has not yet had the time to bring them under its control and to direct them according to laws by it established. If the millionaires of America have, as a matter of fact, but few imitators in Europe, they can boast numberless forerunners in the histories of Greece and Rome. In Athens to begin with, and, later, in the Roman Empire, to mention only the most famous states of the ancient world, education, charity, public amusements, even public works, such as roads, theatres, and temples, were always in part left by the State to the generosity of wealthy individuals, who felt it their duty to contribute out of their means to the public welfare. Amongst the inscriptions which have reached us from the Roman world, and which have been collected in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, we find a considerable number referring to these donations. In all the provinces of the vast Empire, in all the cities great and small, stories have been found recounting, often in forcible terms, the donation by some citizen, during his life or at his death, of a certain sum to the city, it might be to construct or repair an edifice, it might be to distribute grain to the people in time of dearth, or to give bounties of oil on festive occasions,26 or to assure to the people the enjoyment of certain periodical spectacles, or to supplement the finances of the city, which had been thrown into disorder by excessive expenditure, or which were not equal to all the calls made upon them. Every city, then, had her own millionaire benefactors, her little Carnegies, her Huntingtons, Morgans, and Rockefellers in miniature, whose generosity was necessary to the public good, and to whom were raised in gratitude monuments, many of which have come down to our time. The Roman Emperor himself was, at first at any rate, only the most generous and the best known of these rich donors: a kind of Carnegie, Morgan, and Rockefeller of the Empire. Suetonius, for instance, tells us what sums Augustus spent in the course of his life, out of his private patrimony, on public objects. Augustus himself, in the famous Monumentum Ancyranum, the great inscription found in Asia, in which he gives a clear résumé of the story of his life, enumerates many of the gifts which he made to the public out of his own pocket. On several occasions, he simply liquidated the deficit in the Empire’s budget out of his private purse. At another time, he repaired at his own expense the roads of Italy which after the civil wars had through neglect fallen into disrepair. On countless occasions, he spent money for public works, for the relief of famine, for popular amusements, for all the forms of beneficence then customary, without paying any regard to the serious inroads he was making on the fortune which he27 would have to leave to his own heirs. This is exactly what many wealthy men are doing to-day in the New World. It would be in accord with the facts to say that those striking largesses were one of the means by which imperial authority was gradually concentrated at the heart of the Roman State, and surrounded itself with so much gratitude, so many interests, and so many hopes as to be able definitely to secure the principal position amongst all the organs of the State. But if the Emperor was the most generous of the public benefactors, he was not the only one. The chief men throughout the Empire followed his example, some of them on so elaborate a scale as to challenge comparison with the most munificent American millionaires, when account is taken of the difference in the standards of riches in the respective epochs. The best-known figure among these donors is Herodes Atticus, an immensely rich Athenian of the second century A.D. What was his origin, and whence he got his money, we do not know. Probably he belonged to one of those families which had accumulated immense property in the provinces, during the first century of the Christian era, a century of rapidly acquired and great fortunes. This much is certain, that he applied himself to study, and became what was then called a rhetor, corresponding more or less closely to what we term a professor of literature, not however with a view to earning a livelihood, but with the object of cultivating his own and other people’s minds. Highly cultured, erudite,28 and at the same time one of the richest men in the Empire, Herodes was a great friend of Antoninus Pius and of Marcus Aurelius. But, great as was his reputation for wisdom and literary taste, and notwithstanding the enhancement of his prestige through the friendships of the two celebrated emperors, he left a name in the social history of the Roman world more particularly because of the vast sums he gave away all over the Empire. At Athens, he repaired in a splendid way the most ancient and famous buildings of that celebrated city. He presented, repaired, and maintained theatres, aqueducts, temples, and stadia in the cities of Greece and Italy. For the rest, several of the most highly admired buildings and most imposing ruins in Rome are actually gifts made to the public by ancient citizens. Out of them all, I may cite the Pantheon, that marvellous Pantheon, which we all still admire in the heart of Rome, the monument which stands deathless while the stream of ages flows by. This was constructed by Agrippa, the friend of Augustus, at his own expense, and can be compared in this respect to Carnegie Hall in New York. Agrippa built the Pantheon from the same notions of civic zeal that impelled Carnegie to endow New York with his great Hall. And the two monuments, built by the personal munificence of two ultra-wealthy citizens, with an interval of twenty centuries between them, express the same desire to extend to the whole people a share in the enjoyment of the donor’s private fortune. 29 Naturally, my earliest studies in Roman history led me to fix my attention on this bountiful munificence on the part of private persons in the ancient world, by which the rich, either spontaneously or at the call of public opinion, took upon themselves a share of the public burdens. But I had not fully grasped the meaning of this system, until I visited America, and saw the colleges, schools, and hospitals founded and subsidised, the museums and universities endowed, and all the other public institutions aided with millions of dollars by the rich business men and bankers of America. For Europeans, living on a continent where nowadays the State has almost monopolised these functions and exercises them zealously, seeming to resent the interference of private persons, it is difficult to picture correctly a social system in which private generosity is at once possible and necessary, the advantages by which such generosity is accompanied, and the manner in which it is exercised.",
        "target_summary": "In 1906, while lecturing in Paris, the author, a Roman historian, received an invitation to journey to South America. Friends questioned why an ancient historian would visit a \"new world\" focused on the future rather than places like Egypt or the East, rich with ancient traces and ongoing excavations. The author initially justified it by stating his interest in all aspects of life, not just ancient texts, viewing the trip as an intellectual diversion and a source of new impressions, valuable for a historian needing broad human experience. At the time, he considered it a mere \"parenthesis\" in his intellectual life.\n\nHowever, after two journeys, encompassing both South and North America, his perspective profoundly shifted. He now believes that visiting the New World is profoundly beneficial for an ancient historian, potentially as important as visiting ancient sites in Asia Minor or North Africa for understanding Greek or Roman society. He even suggested to a Cornell professor that American students of ancient history, often studying in Europe, would benefit from a \"finishing course\" in America itself, observing its contemporary society.\n\nThis seemingly paradoxical insight arises from recognizing that what we term \"ancient civilizations\" were, during their prime, new and young societies—much like modern American ones. In contrast, genuinely \"ancient\" European civilization often lacks phenomena found in both ancient and modern American societies.\n\nA key shared phenomenon is the widespread munificence of wealthy individuals. In America, wealthy families see it as a social duty to contribute substantially to public good, including education, culture, charity, and supplementing public authorities. This contrasts with Europe, where large fortunes are often more privately enjoyed, and significant donations are uncommon, often drawing criticism for selfishness. This generosity, the author posits, is characteristic of a specific stage in societal development: prosperous, yet relatively young societies where the State has not yet fully centralized and controlled all public functions.\n\nNumerous historical parallels exist in Greece and Rome. In Athens and the Roman Empire, wealthy individuals, either spontaneously or under public pressure, funded education, charity, public entertainment, and infrastructure like roads, theatres, and temples. Inscriptions from the Roman world attest to these donations—citizens contributing sums for building repairs, grain distribution, oil bounties, spectacles, or supplementing city finances. These benefactors were likened to \"miniature Carnegies, Huntingtons, Morgans, and Rockefellers.\" Even Roman emperors, notably Augustus, initially served as the most prominent of these donors, deploying vast private wealth for public works, famine relief, infrastructure repair (like roads after civil wars), and even covering state budget deficits, a practice that helped consolidate imperial authority. Herodes Atticus, a wealthy Athenian rhetor of the 2nd century A.D., is another example, grandly repairing and building structures across Greece and Italy. Agrippa, Augustus's friend, built the Pantheon at his own expense, paralleling Carnegie's endowment of Carnegie Hall; both exemplify the desire to share private fortune with the public.\n\nThough he had studied such munificence in Roman history, the author only \"fully grasped its meaning\" after observing America's institutions—colleges, schools, hospitals, museums, and universities—established and subsidized by its wealthy citizens. For Europeans, accustomed to a State-dominated public sphere, this system of necessary and effective private generosity is difficult to comprehend.",

        "content": "The munificence of the wealthy citizens is only a special instance of a more general and more extensive phenomenon in which America approaches more nearly to the ancient world than Europe; I mean, in that her society is less essentially bureaucratic. In the ancient world, there was no bureaucratic organisation in any of the Greco-Asiatic monarchies founded by Alexander or in the latest period of the Roman Empire which could be considered to resemble even remotely, on a smaller30 scale and merely in broad outlines, that which flourishes in the Europe of to-day. Now, in the most splendid moments of Greek and Roman history, we find states in which all the public functions, even the executive ones, were elective; so that they all changed periodically according to the whims of an electoral body. The need for technical training and professional education for the exercise of certain executive functions was so little recognised that even the command of the military forces and the chief magistracy were filled by public election. A general became a general, not in the course of his professional career, but at the will of the people, assembled in the comitia; and with generals chosen in this way, Rome conquered the world. It is impossible to imagine a social constitution in more striking contradiction to the social constitution of contemporary Europe, which entrusts all the executive functions to a bureaucracy professionally trained, formed into a rigid hierarchy, and dependent on the State, over which the people have practically no power. Men in Europe become generals or judges because they have studied the art of war or law in special schools, not because the majority of an electoral body have thought it opportune to entrust the office to an individual who has been clever enough to appeal to them more strongly than do his rivals. This difference was and is one of the greatest difficulties met with by European historians in the study of the ancient world. I am of opinion, for example, that31 this is one of the weakest points in Mommsen’s history. Accustomed to see bureaucratic states at work, European historians find it difficult to imagine how those states can have prospered in which the magistrates changed periodically, sometimes every year, and in which there was no professional division between the different functions. Instinctively, they tend also to paint the ancient state in the colours of the European state, attributing to it the same virtues and the same defects, and, therefore, representing its weaknesses as well as its merits in a false light. For an American, on the other hand, especially for a North American, the difficulty of understanding the ancient states is much less formidable. Certainly the principle of professional specialisation is much more highly developed in modern American society than it was in the ancient societies. Modern civilisation is nowadays too complex and too technical to admit of the principle of popular election being applied indiscriminately, as at Athens or Rome, to all the public offices. What sensible man would consent to-day, even in the purest of democracies, to the election of the admirals, for instance, by universal suffrage? Nevertheless, in the American confederation many of the public offices, which are now entrusted in Europe to the professional bureaucracy, are elective. And this fact by itself is enough to represent a distinct rapprochement between American society and ancient society. 32 For this reason, an inhabitant of New York can more easily than an inhabitant of London or Paris picture to himself certain aspects of the life of the Athens or Rome of ancient days; especially the continual and frequent succession of elections, and the complete change of interests and of directing forces involved in the change of the magistrates in office. It is true that we in Europe have periodical elections, as in America. Periodically, in the Old, as in the New World, the people assemble to exercise their sovereign right by means of the ballot. But if, regarded superficially, the act and the procedure are identical, their value and importance are different. The populace in the old states of Europe elect only consultative and legislative bodies, while the executive power remains to a great extent independent of the people, residing in a professional bureaucracy whose members cannot be changed from day to day. In America, on the contrary, as in ancient Athens and Rome, many of the magistrates who hold in their hands and exercise directly governing powers are periodically changed at the will of the people, which, therefore, moulds more directly the government and its different organs and more directly inspires and controls its particular functions, just as it used to control them in the ancient states. It is not strange, therefore, that we find ancient Rome reappearing in one of the most important juridical institutions of the United States, an institution which we should search for in vain in Europe, great mistress of33 laws though she be accounted. One of the American institutions which seems to Europeans most contrary to the modern spirit, and for that reason most deserving of severe blame, is the right of “injunctions” with which American magistrates are invested. To Europe, where the bureaucracy, though immovable and little subject to control, cannot step outside the precise prescriptions of the law in the exercise of its functions, this discretionary power of the American magistrates seems little less than an instrument of intolerable tyranny. A brilliant European, who is a distinguished professor of literature in one of the universities of North America, but who, notwithstanding a very lengthy sojourn in the American republic, has preserved intact the ideas and the spirit of the Old World, said to me one day in New York: “In this land of liberty, there is one tyranny more terrible than all the tyrannies of Europe, that of the judicial power!” That a magistrate should have the power to give orders, be they of only momentary validity, which are the expressions of his own will and not of the letter of the law, seems to the European a monstrous thing, a relic of the ancient tyrannies, which harmonises but ill with republican institutions.",
        "target_summary": "American society, being less bureaucratic than Europe, more closely resembles the ancient world. Ancient Greco-Roman states lacked a modern bureaucratic organization; instead, public and executive functions, including military command, were elective and changed periodically based on popular will, with little emphasis on professional training. This contrasts sharply with contemporary Europe, where executive functions are entrusted to professionally trained, rigidly hierarchical bureaucracies, over which the public has virtually no power.\n\nThis difference creates significant difficulty for European historians in understanding how ancient states prospered without permanent, specialized magistrates, often leading them to misinterpret ancient governance. Americans, however, find this less challenging. While modern American society has more professional specialization than ancient societies, many public offices that are bureaucratic in Europe remain elective in America, signifying a distinct resemblance between American and ancient political structures.\n\nThough both Europe and America have periodic elections, their impact differs: European elections primarily concern legislative bodies, leaving executive power largely with an unchanging professional bureaucracy. In contrast, much like ancient Athens and Rome, American elections allow the populace to directly influence and periodically change magistrates holding direct governing powers, thereby shaping the government more immediately.\n\nThis historical connection is evident in American legal institutions, such as the right of \"injunctions,\" a discretionary power of magistrates absent in Europe. To Europeans, accustomed to bureaucracies operating strictly within legal prescriptions, this power for a magistrate to issue orders based on their own will, rather than solely the letter of the law, appears as an intolerable tyranny—a \"monstrous\" relic of ancient systems incompatible with republican institutions.",

        "content": "A historian of the ancient world, on the other hand, is in a position to understand more easily this seeming contradiction. The injunction is nothing else than the edictum of the Roman magistrate; the power, that is to say, which the Roman magistrate possessed, and which the American magistrate, maybe in a less degree,34 possesses, of making good with his personal authority the lacunæ and deficiencies in the law, on every occasion when public order or the principles of justice seemed to demand it urgently. In the eyes of ancient Rome, the magistrate was not only, as in the bureaucratic states of Europe, the cautious and impartial servant and executor of the law. He was also the living personification of the State and of the general interest, invested with full powers of exercising his own judgment, over and above the laws, on behalf of the State and of the general interest, when the law was found wanting. In short, by reinforcing the authority of the magistrates, the ancient states endeavoured to make amends for the weakening of the State which was bound to ensue from the continual electoral changes and the instability of all the offices; while Europe, on the other hand, which, with her rigid bureaucracies, has made the power of the State so strong, can rigorously limit the powers of her functionaries with laws of immense scope. But one last remnant of the ancient conception, tempered by the modern spirit of the State, survives in North America, where, the elective principle being more extensively applied than in the states of Europe, the tendency is, by way of compensation, to reinforce by some discretionary power, like the “injunction,” some at least of the judicial offices. Perhaps we may explain in this way the fact that some European writers in the nineteenth century have ventured to assert that the ancients never knew what liberty was, even in what were apparently35 the most democratic republics; while others have maintained that more liberty is to be found in the constitutional monarchies of Europe than in the authoritative American republics. Another instance still more curious is afforded us by those dictators who, under varying titles and with varying success, have appeared in almost all the republics of Spanish America, after the emancipation of these territories from the mother country. The latest of these dictators was Porfirio Diaz, who governed Mexico for so many years. Europe has never properly understood these dictators. She has mistaken them for caricatures, now of Nero, now of Napoleon, and has drawn the conclusion that the republics in question were impregnated with the disease of tyranny, and could not exist in a state of liberty. But a historian of the ancient world recognises at once in these dictators a modern incarnation of a figure which constantly appears in ancient history, the Greek τύραννος, the Roman princeps. Pisistratus and Augustus, not Nero and Napoleon, are the prototypes of these dictators. States based on an electoral system which is not controlled by organised parties or by other social forces calculated to ensure its working in conformity with precise and certain rules, are subject to eruptions of disorder, which end in establishing the personal power of that individual who succeeds in making the political and administrative machine work with comparative regularity. Augustus was throughout forty-one years re-elected36 every five or ten years head of the republic, because he had succeeded, by his influence and personal ability, in making the machine of the comitia and senate run smoothly, at a time when the Roman aristocracy, which had controlled it for centuries, could no longer, owing to its own discords, do so. The reason why the power of Augustus was prolonged and extended in all directions until it became a dictatorship for life, cloaked under legal forms, was that he alone seemed capable of ensuring a wise government and of preventing civil wars. And was not just this the real reason for the long tenure of power by Porfirio Diaz in Mexico, and for his prolonged presidency, which was merely a dictatorship masquerading under republican forms? Anyone who wishes to understand the government of Mexico during the last forty years might find the history of Augustus of great service; just as a profound knowledge of the recent history of Mexico might help to the understanding of the ancient history of Augustus. A profound study of ancient history is, therefore, an excellent preparation for the rapid understanding of certain parts, at any rate, of the American constitution and of American society; just as a knowledge of America should be an excellent aid to the study of ancient history. In fact, in the course of my travels and observations in America, after having devoted ten years to the study of a large section of ancient history, I have realised how much the ancient history, which I had studied in Europe, helped me to understand America;37 and how much the America which I had before my eyes helped me to a better understanding of the distant reality of that vanished world of long ago. And if we follow the track of these studies and reflections, I think that we shall be able to attribute also a more precise meaning to that epithet of “young,” which is constantly applied to America. Who does not talk a hundred times a year of old Europe and young America? Now what do these two much-used and much-abused epithets mean? That Europe has a longer history than America? In that case the contrasting terms would not mean much. For that is a simple chronological statement, which only demands a knowledge of the fact that America was not discovered till 1492 A.D. Do they mean that America is more vigorous, more active, more daring than Europe, just as young men usually possess these qualities in a greater degree than the old? As a matter of fact, many people do use the two adjectives in this sense. But, in that case, they assume as proved one of the most complex, one of the deepest and most difficult problems of modern life, that is to say, the problem whether a comparison can be struck between Europe and America, and if so, on the basis of what criterion? That there should be those who strike this comparison and resolve it in this way, is not surprising. But no one will be found to pretend that the judgment contained in those two words “young” and “old,” thus interpreted, can or ought to be accepted as true by everyone. 38 On the other hand, it is possible to agree on a more narrow and precise interpretation of these words; to say that America is young and Europe old, because America reproduces some of the characters and phenomena which we find in antiquity, that is to say, in the remotest epochs of our history. European civilisation, as the result of her migration to America, there to found new states and societies, has really become, in a certain sense, regenerated, because she has again become, in the light of certain characteristics and certain institutions, what she was twenty centuries ago. And if the “youth” of America is understood in this sense, it is not rash to argue that it too will grow old. The study of ancient history can be of a certain practical value to those who consider America with the object of divining, in this great community, the tendencies and inclinations of the future. For students of that history can bring a plausible criterion of prevision to their observations. In fact, it is not rash to suppose, at least if some unknown force does not unexpectedly divert the course of events in the New World, that all the parts of American life and society which most resemble ancient society are destined to disappear gradually, as America grows older and elaborates a complex and artificial civilisation; just as the ancient institutions and ideas of which we find so many traces in America gradually disappeared in Europe in the progress of time, as civilisation in the Old World became artificial and complex. If this prophecy is not fallacious, we should expect history,39 which eternally repeats herself, to require the man of the New World to witness the same phenomena whose more gradual realisation they have already witnessed in the ancient world. In the New World also, we should expect to see a society regulated by elective and authoritative institutions gradually become bureaucratic and at the same time fetter every branch of political and administrative powers with the tight bonds of rigid juridical principles. This will be a slow, but profound transformation, in the course of which many things will change their position and value. Perhaps the inexhaustible public munificence of the millionaires will become exhausted, and the State will grow in prestige and influence, if not in power.",
        "target_summary": "A historian of the ancient world readily understands concepts like the \"injunction,\" which parallels the Roman magistrate's *edictum*. Roman magistrates possessed personal authority to address legal deficiencies when public order or justice urgently required it, effectively serving as the living embodiment of the State and general interest, with powers extending beyond strict laws. This reinforced magisterial authority compensated for the instability caused by frequent electoral changes in ancient states. In contrast, modern European states, with their rigid bureaucracies, limit functionaries' powers through extensive laws.\n\nHowever, a remnant of this ancient approach persists in North America. Here, the widespread application of the elective principle leads to a compensatory reinforcement of some judicial offices through discretionary powers like the \"injunction.\" This helps explain why 19th-century European writers sometimes perceived less liberty in \"authoritative American republics\" than in Europe's constitutional monarchies, despite America's democratic framework.\n\nFurthermore, ancient world historians recognize in Latin American dictators (such as Porfirio Diaz) not caricatures of Nero or Napoleon, but modern incarnations of ancient figures like the Greek *tyrannos* or Roman *princeps* (e.g., Pisistratus, Augustus). These dictators arise when electoral systems, lacking control by organized parties or strong social forces, lead to disorder. Such individuals step in to stabilize the political and administrative machinery. Augustus, for example, maintained power for decades by successfully operating the Roman system when the aristocracy failed, his legally veiled dictatorship preventing civil wars and ensuring stable government. Similarly, Diaz's long presidency in Mexico was a republican-masked dictatorship, driven by the need for order. Thus, a deep understanding of Augustus aids in comprehending Diaz, and vice versa, underscoring the reciprocal value of studying ancient history to understand American society and vice-versa.\n\nThis comparative perspective also refines the labels \"old Europe\" and \"young America.\" Beyond a simple chronological difference or an assumption of American vigor, America is \"young\" because it reproduces certain characteristics and phenomena found in antiquity, the earliest periods of history. European civilization, by migrating to America and founding new societies, effectively underwent a \"regeneration,\" re-adopting ancient traits and institutions. If \"youth\" is understood in this sense, then America, too, is destined to \"grow old.\"\n\nConsequently, ancient history offers a valuable predictive framework for understanding America's future. It suggests that as America matures and develops a complex civilization, its current ancient-like aspects – particularly its elective and authoritative institutions – will gradually disappear. This mirrors Europe's historical progression from ancient institutions to a more artificial and intricate civilization. The prophecy implies that American society will increasingly become bureaucratic, with political and administrative powers becoming rigidly bound by legal principles. This slow but profound transformation may also see the inexhaustible public philanthropy of millionaires diminish, while the State's prestige and influence grow.",

        "content": "Suetonius recounts that one day a man presented himself to the Emperor Vespasian, and showed him the models of a machine, thanks to which the Emperor could have finished off the construction of certain of his great public works with fewer labourers, and at a great saving of expense. Vespasian was full of praise for the man’s ingenuity, and recompensed him with a sum of money; but he subsequently had the model destroyed, saying that he did not wish to have any machines which would cause his people to go hungry. Applying the standard of modern ideas, how should we judge this sentiment and act? Of course, we should consider it a strange and absurd mistake. Suetonius, on the contrary, quotes the incident to prove how wise Vespasian was. In this divergence of opinion is revealed the essential difference between ourselves and the ancients, between modern civilisation and Greco-Roman civilisation, for all that these resemble each other in so many particulars; the principal difference between the ancient world and America. Although,41 as I have shown in my preceding essay, America in certain of its institutions and forms of social life resembles the ancient world more than Europe, this comparison does not hold true so far as the instruments of economic production are concerned. In this respect America is much further removed from the ancient world than is Europe, and represents to-day the beginning of a new era and a new civilisation, whose spirit and tendencies would be quite incomprehensible to a re-embodied Greek or Roman. Greco-Roman antiquity never dreamed that it might be a useful, beautiful, glorious work to invent machines of increasing speed and power, and therefore never gave a thought to those technical elaborations which are the pride of our times. It possessed the elementary machines, the lever, jack-screw, the inclined plane; but it never tried to combine these into more complicated machines. In particular, it never called into play the effort to which all the mechanism of modern times owes its birth; that is to say, it never tried to endow its machines with a more rapid motion than the muscles of men or of animals can endow them with, or to search nature for motive forces of greater power than these. It availed itself only sparingly and on rare occasions of the force of running water or of the wind. The latter it used only for navigation, and even then with regret, hesitation, and fear, as if it were doing an illicit and shameful thing. It knew of no combustible other than the wood of the trees. Notwithstanding the fact42 that Pliny the elder has preserved for us so much precious information about agriculture and the ancient arts and industries, his writings contain scarcely a single hint suggesting that the men of his civilisation had any desire to make the instruments of economic production more perfect and effective. In one place, the sail, as compared with the oar, inspires him to write a passage in which the modern reader imagines just at first that he has lighted on a sentiment containing a distant echo of contemporary enthusiasm for progress. “Is there a greater marvel in the whole world?” he writes. A grass exists [flax, of which sails are made] which brings Egypt and Italy so close together that two prefects of Egypt, Galerius and Balbillus, crossed from Alexandria to the straits of Messina, one in seven days and the other in six; and that last summer the senator Valerius Marianus reached Alexandria from Pozzuoli in a light wind in nine days. There is a grass which brings me in seven days from Gades, the harbour near the Pillars of Hercules, to Ostia, in four from this side of Spain, in three from the province of Narbonne, in two from Africa, as C. Flavius, the envoy of the proconsul Vilius Crispus, found. Does it not seem as if we were reading an anticipation by eighteen hundred years of that hymn which moderns so often raise to the power of steam and to the great ocean liners which cross the Atlantic in five or six days? But ours is only a brief illusion. The wonder and the admiration of Pliny are soon over, and a sort of awe takes their place. “Audax vita, scelerum plena!” he43 quickly adds. “Creature full of wicked daring!” The invention of sails seems to him almost a sacrilegious impiety, and his view was that of all the ancients. In short, the few victories which the ancients had won over nature were to them a cause of embarrassment rather than of enthusiasm; for they saw in them merely a proof of the perversity and foolhardiness of human pride. If a contemporary of Sophocles or Horace came back to the world, he would probably just at first be terrified by what he saw all round him, as by the spectacle of a gigantic and unheard-of madness. Machinery, which to us seems the most marvellous instrument of our energy and intelligence, appeared to the ancients a danger, an enemy, and almost a sacrilege: an attempt to rebel against the gods and their wishes. Consequently, they invented and adopted machines—and those but simple and primitive ones—only for use in war, especially for siege-work. The necessity of conquering made them forget to some extent their usual fears. So great a difference in thought and feeling, in a matter which to us seems of such vital importance, must arise from deep-seated causes. Why did the ancients invent and construct so few machines, and hold in such fear the few they had? Why did they wish the hand of man to be the principal and the most powerful among the instruments of production? Many attribute the inferiority of the ancients in this department to the comparatively undeveloped state of science. Vast and44 profound knowledge of science, they say, is required for the construction of modern machines. The ancients did not possess this knowledge; therefore, they conclude, they could not construct the machines. But, in this deduction there are two exaggerations. The services of science, especially in early times, to machines and their progress, are exaggerated; so also is the scientific ignorance of the ancients. Science has helped materially to perfect certain machines, but has actually invented scarcely one. Many of the marvellous machines which, at a giddy rate, multiply riches all round us, have been conceived for the first time in the minds of artisans, contre-maîtres, managers of factories, and other persons more expert in practice than rich in scientific lore. The founder of the great mechanical industry, Arkwright, who invented the cotton-spinning machine, was a barber. Watt, the inventor of the steam-engine, though perhaps a better-educated man than Arkwright, was not in any sense a great scientist. For the rest, whoever knows the history of machinery is aware that science did not begin to concern herself with machinery, or to inquire whether her studies might help inventors with useful suggestions, until the great mechanical industry had already invaded the world. Science, then, only followed a movement which had already begun, and did not give it the first impulse. Furthermore, the scientific ignorance of the ancients is exaggerated. Ancient science is not so well-known45 as ancient art and literature; and it certainly did not make very striking progress during the last brilliant period of ancient history—the Roman Empire. Therefore to many, whose knowledge regarding it is comparatively superficial, the ancient world may seem empty of scientific wisdom. But such is not the case. If the Romans never applied much thought to the scientific study of nature, the Greeks for their part had laid the foundations of many sciences, and had laid them boldly and truly. Even the Copernican system had been anticipated by Greek astronomers, like Aristarchus of Samos and Seleucus of Seleucia, who had maintained that the earth revolved round the sun, and that the firmament was much more vast than was generally supposed. We need not, therefore, believe that the ancients were not able to construct more complicated machines than those they used, because they lacked scientific knowledge. It would be nearer the truth to say that they did not make much effort to raise sciences out of the necessarily narrow domain of purely theoretical problems, because, independent as they were of machinery, they had no need of the practical aids which science, if developed in certain directions, can lend to the construction of machines. In fact, we men of the present day encourage the sciences to search and investigate in every direction and to try every path, not from a disinterested love of the True nor from an intellectual curiosity to spy out the mysteries of nature;46 but because we hope that we shall discover, in the course of our all-embracing search, laws or bodies or forces which will help us to subdue and exploit nature. The ancients then abstained from inventing and constructing machines, not from lack of knowledge but from lack of will. The effort seemed to them useless, nay, pernicious; and the enterprise did not attract them. It remains, therefore, to consider why the ancients, in their great struggle to extend the dominion of man over nature, felt no need of help from swift engines of iron, and, therefore, did not make the effort necessary to invent them. This is a question of the highest importance for the history of civilisation, for by its solution only can we gain an insight into what is perhaps the most profound difference between ancient and modern civilisation. The difference consists in this: while our civilisation is a mechanical-scientific civilisation, the ancient was above all things an artistic civilisation. Therefore our civilisation tends in the main to multiply the needs and the consumption of man, so as to quicken production as much as possible, while the ancient civilisation tended to limit man’s needs and consumption, to hold up to esteem and imitation customs of simplicity and parsimony which involved a reduction in consumption, and therefore in production. If we are to grasp the very essence of our history, we must understand clearly how indisolubly united are the artistic civilisation and the ideal of a simple life, the mechanical-scientific47 civilisation and the ideal of a life of extravagance and luxury. Even at the present day, many will be found to extol the greatness, the wealth, and the might of the Roman Empire as a marvel never surpassed in history. But this is a delusion. The Roman Empire seemed marvellously wealthy and powerful to the ancients, because they had never yet seen greater wealth and greater might. But what are the wealth and the might of the Roman Empire compared with the might and the wealth of the great modern states of Europe and America? One observation will suffice to give an idea of the difference. We are justified in deducing from the great number of facts and data in our possession that in the most flourishing and wealthy centuries the budget of the Empire, the sum total, that is, of all the items of expenditure which the central government at Rome had to meet—expenditure on the most important public services of so immense an empire, which comprised the whole basin of the Mediterranean, and a large part of Europe, Asia, and Africa—fell short, far short, of the municipal budget of the city of New York. Only the man who is conversant with the customs of the past in their minutest details can fully estimate how much simpler, poorer, and more economical the civilisation of the ancients was than that which has permeated America and Europe since the invention of the steam-engine and electricity, when the riches of the New World, exploited48 intensively with the help of machinery, began to flood the earth. Consuming little, and content with a life of simplicity and poverty, the ancients had no need to produce much or to produce at great speed. So they had no requirement for machines, whether steam- or electricity-driven. The few simple machines, which the hand of man or the muscular force of domestic animals can operate,—the domestic loom, the horse-propelled mill,—sufficed. Therefore, they had no need of science to help them to construct new machines of greater size and power. They had no need to work at high pressure. They could work slowly, with their hands and with a few simple instruments, and with them produce beautiful, accurate, and finished articles, which aspired to a lofty and difficult ideal of perfection. Accordingly, art occupied in the ancient world the position which science occupies in modern civilisation. It was not a refined luxury for the few, but an elementary and universal necessity. Governments and wealthy citizens were obliged to adorn their cities with monuments, sculptures, and pictures, to embellish squares, streets, and houses, because the masses wished the cities to be beautiful, and would have rebelled against an authority which would have them live in an unadorned city; just as nowadays they would rebel against a municipal authority which would have them dwell in a city without light, or against a government which placed obstacles and hindrances in the way of the49 construction of railways. In those times, the requirement was that everything, down to the household utensils, even of the most modest description and destined for the use of the poorer classes, be inspired with a breath of beauty. Anyone who visits a museum of Greco-Roman antiquities, in which are exposed to view objects found in rich and highly cultivated districts,—that of Naples, for example, where so many objects excavated from the ashes of Pompeii are to be seen,—can easily convince himself of this curious phenomenon, and realise more vividly, by contrast, the carelessness, roughness, and commonplace vulgarity of the objects made by modern machinery. In short, if the quantity of the things produced by the industry of the ancients was small, for that very reason, and by way of compensation, their quality was refined and excellent. The contrary is the case in the modern world. The quantity of the things which modern industry, thanks to electricity- and steam-driven machinery, produces, is prodigious. No century ever witnessed the realisation of the miracle of abundance in a more marvellous way. But the quality of the things suffers in consequence. The ugliness and the crude vulgarity of so many objects, which in much poorer times had an elegance and a beauty which have now vanished, are the price we pay for the abundance of our times. The necessities of man have increased beyond all measure, and to satisfy them lavish and rapid production50 is required. The need for rapid production accounts for the invention of so many machines. But it is not possible to secure the manufacture by rigid hands of iron of so many things at such speed, and at the same time to impart to them an exquisitely artistic appearance, revealing the personal excellence of the artist. It is as much as we can do to impart to them a coarse and rude appearance of beauty, with a few ornamentations copied casually from the beautiful things which our fathers succeeded in creating in poorer and less busy times. Machinery, driven by steam or electricity, has the advantage of speed over the hand of man. It can produce in the same time a much greater number of objects. For this reason it has triumphed in a time like ours, in which the increased necessities of the world demand an extraordinary growth in production. But the hand of man,—that living and mind-inspired machine,—if it cannot compete with machines of iron for speed, is alone capable of imparting to things that perfection, that grace, and that excellence of form which can fill us with a joy which is different from, but perhaps more intense than, that afforded by easy and coarse abundance.",
        "target_summary": "This excerpt contrasts ancient Greco-Roman and modern civilizations by examining their differing attitudes toward machinery and economic production. The author opens with Emperor Vespasian’s decision to destroy a labor-saving machine, fearing it would cause unemployment, an act deemed wise by ancient standards but absurd by modern ones. This incident highlights a fundamental divergence between the two eras.\n\nAncient civilization did not value the invention of increasingly fast or powerful machines for economic production. While they possessed elementary tools, they generally avoided combining them into more complex devices or utilizing non-muscle motive forces like water or wind, often viewing such endeavors with hesitation or even fear. Pliny the Elder, for instance, expressed both wonder and dread towards sails. Ancients largely considered machinery dangerous, a symbol of human hubris, and nearly sacrilegious, only employing simple devices for military purposes out of necessity.\n\nThe author refutes the common idea that ancient mechanical \"inferiority\" stemmed from a lack of scientific knowledge. He points out that Greek science was sophisticated, and many pivotal modern inventions (like Arkwright's spinning machine or Watt's steam engine) originated from practical artisans, not necessarily \"great scientists\"; furthermore, science often followed industrial development rather than instigating it. Therefore, the ancients' limited adoption of machines was not due to inability, but a conscious lack of *will*, perceiving such pursuits as useless or harmful.\n\nThe core reason for this distinction lies in their civilizational ideals: Modern civilization is \"mechanical-scientific,\" driven by the multiplication of needs, consumption, and the demand for rapid, high-volume production. In contrast, ancient civilization was \"artistic,\" prioritizing simplicity, parsimony, and limiting consumption, which in turn reduced the need for extensive or speedy production. The author illustrates this by noting that the entire budget of the vast Roman Empire was less than the municipal budget of modern New York City, demonstrating the ancients' fundamentally simpler and less opulent way of life.\n\nConsequently, the ancients, content with simple living, required only basic, hand-operated tools. They worked slowly, emphasizing exceptional quality, beauty, and artistic perfection in all produced items, from grand monuments to humble household goods. Art was a universal necessity, permeating daily life and civic spaces, much like infrastructure today. Modern industry, powered by steam and electricity, prioritizes immense quantity and speed to meet escalating demands, often sacrificing the exquisite aesthetic quality and unique artistic touch achievable by human craftsmanship. While modern machinery brings unprecedented abundance, it often results in a widespread commonality or even \"vulgarity\" of goods, whereas the human hand, though slower, imparts a distinct perfection that machines cannot replicate.",

        "content": "This contrast between ancient and modern times, between the civilisations which preceded the French Revolution and the modern American civilisation, should and would have received more attention than it has, had not the students of antiquity been too prone to lose51 their way in the maze of a dead erudition. We are proud of our wealth and power. We are proud of having extended our dominion over the whole planet, only a small part of which was known to the ancients, and that but vaguely. We are proud of having surprised so many of nature’s secrets, of having deciphered the mystery of so many laws, of having thrown light on so many lurking-places of disease and death, of having shaken ourselves free from so many vain fears which tormented our ancestors, of having released ourselves from so many yokes—political, moral, and intellectual—which used to weigh upon their necks. We feel ourselves strong, sure of ourselves and of our destiny as no men before us in history, in face of the blind forces of the Universe, so many of which we have subjected to our dominion and forced to serve our necessities, our ambitions, and our whims. Nevertheless, in the midst of all this wealth, this power, and this knowledge, a dull sense of disquietude vexes men’s souls. Man is not yet content. Every day he finds new pretexts or motives for complaining. One of the most oft-repeated of these pretexts or motives is, that the world is becoming uglier. If in our cities any beautiful part remains, it is nearly always the old part. In the historical cities, the new parts are horrible, and form a strange contrast with the older. The altogether-new cities—especially those which have sprung up in the last century in America—appear to the artistic eye almost always like a sort of anteroom to the infernal52 regions. Architecture has become a mother of monsters. Sculpture and painting, which were once upon a time the two most select amongst the decorative arts, protected and pampered by the great ones of the earth and adored by the masses, are reduced to the necessity of employing a thousand artifices to extort orders out of the negligent malevolence of an epoch, whose ornaments and monuments seem an encumbrance and an excrescence rather than a beauty. There was a time when the dress of men and women was a work of art. At the present day, only that of women has preserved a certain artistic grace and beauty. Let us not dwell upon the countless other forms of ugliness which have invaded our houses with the furniture, the carpets, the candelabra, and the china. The artistic mediocrity of our epoch is surpassed only by the superficiality and confusion of its tastes. Each succeeding year sees that which used to appear the height of elegance and beauty to its predecessors, despised, neglected, and forgotten. All the styles of the past and all the styles of the different countries swirl round us, before the fickle gusts of fashion. Every picture which excites admiration for a moment is quickly forgotten by the fickle taste of an age which ransacks every corner in search of the beautiful, because nowhere can the beautiful be found. Many ask themselves what is the origin of this strange corruption of taste and of the æsthetic sense. But no two people agree on the answer. This one attributes the degeneration53 to the decadence of traditions, and therefore proposes to open schools and to institute courses of instruction. That one, on the other hand, traces the responsibility to the lack of liberty afforded the public taste and the genius of the artists, a condition of things for which these same traditions are to blame. Such a one therefore inveighs against the schools and the rules of tradition, and would like to see them all swept away. Nobody can explain how it happens that so rich, so wise, and so powerful a civilisation does not succeed in being beautiful, and shows itself powerless to infuse a breath of beauty into anything it creates, be it big or little, into its cities or into the small objects of daily use. But the history of civilisation explains this apparent mystery. A civilisation cannot deck itself with the most exquisite beauties of art, if it cannot persuade itself to live with a certain simplicity and to work with a certain deliberation. What kills art in our civilisation is the mad desire for wealth, the giddy increase of necessities, the universal craze for speed, the effort to multiply production, the general restlessness of body and mind. Beauty is not so simple and commonplace a thing as to admit of its examples being multiplied by machinery in furious haste. Whether in big things or in little, it can only be the result of a long and steady effort of the intellect and the will, which must be expressed at all costs through the medium of that living and marvellous machine, the human hand. If we wish to accumulate round us the wealth of the world at54 express speed, if we wish to produce and to consume with giddy rapidity, we must not be too exacting in our demands for quality and beauty in the things produced. We cannot have a great deal in this world, and have that great deal beautiful. Therefore, speaking still more generally, we might say that in the ancient civilisation the dominant principle was quality, in the modern civilisation, on the other hand, quantity. In ancient times, the more cultured, powerful, and wealthy a nation became, the greater efforts it made to produce in every branch of human activity but few things, but to ensure the materialisation in those things of a difficult and lofty ideal of perfection which should find common acceptance and admiration. Men of our time, on the other hand, direct their efforts towards production in large quantities, and at great speed, and are proud of seeing their power and grandeur expressed in the formidable figures of modern statistics. That the goods produced are of deteriorating quality is of small account. Thus the ancient civilisations tended, so to speak, towards eternity, towards the manufacture of things which, if not eternal in the precise meaning of the word, should last a long time, should conquer the ages, and should succeed in conveying to distant posterity a supreme image of their past existence. In very truth, after numberless catastrophes and pillagings, the material remains of ancient civilisations, which are piously preserved to this day, are very numerous. Our age produces55 in great quantities, but maybe not a single one of the buildings and material objects produced by it in such abundance can hope to conquer the ages. Everything is precarious, ephemeral, destined to live a few months or a few years; destined to a premature death from the very first hour of its birth. And this diversity crops up again in every branch of human activity; in industrial as in intellectual activity, in art as in literature. We look upon the literatures of Greece and Rome as a treasure of inestimable value, almost as the foundation of our culture; and we still recommend them as models to all who wish to learn the difficult art of writing and of speaking with precision, elegance, and clearness. And yet how little the ancients wrote and read compared with ourselves! The press did not exist; paper, now the cheapest of materials, was a rare luxury—the papyrus was a most precious Egyptian monopoly. Consequently, the number of persons who could provide themselves with books was very small, and such persons were found only among the élite of culture or of wealth. The only opportunities of reading the people had were afforded by the public notices, and by the laws engraved on bronze or marble tablets. In those times, there was nothing to correspond in any way at all with the newspapers of to-day. In view of the very scanty numbers of the readers of books, those also who wrote them were bound to be few in number; these could not write much. With but very few exceptions, the works bequeathed to us by the ancients are by no56 means voluminous. Of all the qualities commonly found in Greek and Latin writers, sobriety and conciseness are the most prominent. These virtues were to some extent the product of circumstances. For in times in which paper was so dear, and every copy of a book had to be prepared specially by an amanuensis, conciseness and brevity were the two qualities of importance to insure the wide circulation and preservation of a book. It was, however, just the circumstance that the ancients wrote so little that enabled them to carry the art of writing to an indescribable pitch of perfection; that enabled them to obtain that clearness, that harmony, that cadence and proportion of phrase, that concentration which has made them the great masters of the literary art for all time. And to-day!—A wolfish, insatiable hunger for printed paper and reading matter is the scourge of our civilisation. Look at the Pantagruelian literary orgies to which Europe and America surrender themselves! Every day brings its daily paper, every week its journals, illustrated or otherwise, every month its reviews and magazines. Then we have the special publications devoted to a particular art, a particular profession, a particular industry, a favourite sport, in number without end. We have, too, the volumes of every kind and quality with which a crowd of publishers congests the book market: novels, poems, books of travel, science, political economy, religion, sport. Who could enumerate all the kinds of books which are published nowadays? Many of these, it is57 true, do not find readers, but many do; and a certain number, so many readers as to be sold in thousands, in tens of thousands, and to be scattered broadcast all over the world. But to satisfy a public which is so greedy of reading, an extraordinary number of writers is required at the present day, from the obscure editors of provincial journals to the favoured few who succeed in winning world-fame, and in reaching the position of sovereigns or, if you prefer it, satraps of literature. And all this enormous multitude of writers is compelled to write prolifically and rapidly, because the public wants to read voraciously. It must choose diverse topics, and vary its themes according to the varieties of fashion and events. On the other hand, it is no longer compelled to be concise, both because the public often likes prolixity, which makes reading comfortable and easy, and because, nowadays, printing is so cheap and facile. But the art of writing is being lost through this haste, this instability of public interest, this prolixity. Every tongue is becoming a muddy mixture of words and phrases which have dripped from every point of heaven on to the daily language and literature. Taste is being corrupted, with writers as with readers, deteriorating now into negligence and carelessness, now into affectation and grotesqueness.",
        "target_summary": "The author posits that modern society, particularly American civilization post-French Revolution, distinguishes itself from ancient civilizations through its immense pride in wealth, global dominion, scientific discoveries, and liberation from past fears and oppressions. However, despite this power and knowledge, a \"dull sense of disquietude\" pervades, rooted in a perception that the world is becoming uglier. Modern cities, architecture, and even everyday objects lack beauty, with artistic tastes described as superficial and transient.\n\nThis aesthetic decline is attributed to a fundamental difference in civilizational values. Ancient civilizations prioritized **quality** and a \"difficult and lofty ideal of perfection,\" creating few things that were meant to last and convey a supreme image to posterity. Modern civilization, conversely, is driven by a \"mad desire for wealth,\" speed, and mass production, valuing **quantity** over the enduring beauty achieved through \"long and steady effort\" and the human hand. Consequently, modern creations are often precarious, ephemeral, and destined for quick obsolescence, contrasting sharply with the long-preserved artifacts of antiquity.\n\nThis divergence is exemplified in literature. Ancient Greek and Roman writers, constrained by scarce and expensive materials, produced concise, perfect, and enduring works that are still held as models of precision and elegance. In contrast, the modern era's \"insatiable hunger for printed paper\" fuels a vast, rapid, and often prolific output from countless writers. While this satisfies public demand, it sacrifices the art of writing, leading to corrupted taste, negligence, and a general loss of literary precision due to haste and instability of interest.",

        "content": "Quality and quantity: these are the two principles of the two civilisations, the ancient and the modern.58 They are two opposite principles, a circumstance which explains why in the last fifty years the gradual triumph of the civilisation of machinery or of industry on a large scale, which aims at multiplying the quantity of riches, has been accompanied by a decline in classical studies. The new generation, even that portion of it that represents the educated classes, has broken away from the study of a world which, though resembling the modern world in so many of its ideas and institutions, differed from the present era in the fundamental conception of life, and professed an entirely different idea of perfection. However, if the two principles are mutually exclusive, we must ask ourselves, which is true and which false, which is good and which is not. Who is in the right,—we, who wish to fill the world with riches, even at the cost of disfiguring it and making it hideous; or the ancients, who were content to live a life of greater simplicity, of more leisurely and more peaceful activity, but wished to spend it in a persevering effort to materialise their ideals of beauty? In how many of the confused disputes which set the men of our times by the ears is this problem obscurely implied, though the disputants are unaware of it? But the problem is a terrible one, because it involves all the fundamental problems of contemporary life and the very destiny of the gigantic operations to which our own generation, and those which preceded it, have applied themselves with such frenzied activity. So I will not attempt to solve the formidable problem.59 Yet may I be permitted to express a thought, simple in itself, but one which presents itself with the smiling countenance of hope. It is, that “opposite” principles do not mean “irreconcilable” principles. Is it not just possible that this craze for work, for riches, and for speed, of which we are victims, may slacken somewhat, and give men time to collect their thoughts, and to piece together again the shattered grandeur of the modern world in the image of a more serene and composed beauty? Are men really doomed to become more insatiable, the richer they become; or will the day arrive when they will think it wiser to employ a larger part of the immense riches they possess, not in producing other riches, but in embellishing the world, seeing that beauty is no less a joy in life than wealth, and that we ourselves, though all athirst for gold, prove that it is so, by searching untiringly in every corner for the few remains of ancient beauty? I feel that I have not the courage to answer this question with a brutal “No”; and I hope that many others will be of the same opinion. For one cannot help thinking that one of the most marvellous epochs in history would really begin on the day on which Europe and America succeeded in reconciling in a new civilisation the two opposite principles of quantity and quality, and in employing the extraordinary riches at their disposal in adorning and beautifying the world, which their energy and audacity have so immeasurably enlarged in recent centuries.",
        "target_summary": "The excerpt posits that ancient and modern civilizations are defined by two opposing principles: quality and quantity. The recent triumph of large-scale industrial civilization, focused on multiplying wealth (quantity), has led to a decline in classical studies. The new generation, even the educated, has drifted from the ancient world, which held a fundamentally different ideal of perfection, often centered on beauty.\n\nThis presents a crucial dilemma: is it right to pursue vast riches, even if it means disfiguring the world, or to live a simpler, more leisurely, and peaceful life dedicated to materializing ideals of beauty, as the ancients did? This profound, often unrecognized, problem underlies many contemporary disputes and affects the destiny of modern endeavors.\n\nWhile not offering a definitive solution, the author expresses a hopeful thought: \"opposite\" principles are not necessarily \"irreconcilable.\" Perhaps the current societal \"craze for work, riches, and speed\" will eventually lessen, allowing humanity to reflect and reintegrate a more serene and composed beauty into the modern world. The author questions whether people are fated to become endlessly insatiable as they grow wealthier, or if they might choose to use their immense wealth to embellish the world, recognizing that beauty brings joy no less than riches—a truth evidenced by humanity's tireless search for remnants of ancient beauty. The author feels it impossible to answer this question with a \"No,\" hoping for a \"marvellous epoch\" where Europe and America reconcile quality and quantity, employing their extraordinary wealth and world-enlarging energy to adorn and beautify the world.",

        "content": "Some years ago, in the course of the excavations which are being made with such success in Egypt, a papyrus was found which is now known among archæologists by the name of The Petition of Dionysia. This papyrus, which belongs to the second century A.D., contains on one side some books of the Iliad, on the other a defence presented by a certain Dionysia to an Egyptian court, before which she was defending an action brought against her by her own father affecting her dowry and other questions of interest. To escape paying his daughter and her husband the sums which they demanded, the father had directed the husband to return him his daughter, and had dissolved the marriage. But the daughter, on her side, maintained in her defence that the father had forfeited his right to dissolve her marriage and to separate her from her husband, because her marriage was a “written” marriage—established, that is to say, by an act or document in writing. If it had been an “unwritten” marriage, Dionysia would not have contested her61 father’s right in that case to dissolve it, for no motive whatever, merely because it so pleased him. It would be difficult to imagine a document more strange than this, from the point of view of the ideas which prevail at the present day in European and American society. Matrimony is for us an act of so great social importance that the state alone—that is to say, the law, and the law courts—can recognise or dissolve it. To leave the destiny of a family at the mercy of the will of the father of one of the two parties, to recognise as his the right to destroy a family at any moment to suit his individual interest, without being accountable to anyone for so doing, would seem to us a monstrous thing. And yet this monstrous thing seemed to the whole of antiquity, with few restrictions and reservations, legitimate, reasonable, and wise. Differences in the organisation of the family existed in different countries and in different centuries; but they were but superficial, unessential differences. On one point, the whole world agreed: that matrimony should never be considered an act to be left to the will of the contracting parties, but a business transaction which the young people should leave to their fathers to arrange. Matrimony, as it was in Rome, will serve to give a clear idea of the ancient world’s conception of the family. In Rome, fathers often betrothed their sons when they were still children. They made them marry when they were still quite young, the males before they were twenty, the girls at about sixteen; and they had62 the right to oblige them at any moment to divorce each other, without being forced to give any reason or explanation. A man might be an exemplary husband, might live with his wife in the most perfect bliss. If the son’s wife, for one reason or another, did not suit the fancy of his father, the son might be obliged any day to put her away. Amongst others to whom this happened was no less a person than Tiberius, at a time when he had already become one of the first figures in the Empire, and had commanded armies in battle. He had married a daughter of Agrippa, and loved her devotedly. The couple were considered in Rome a model of affection and faithfulness. But, at a certain moment, Augustus, who was the adoptive father of Tiberius, judged that for political motives another marriage might have suited Tiberius better; and he, accordingly, obliged Tiberius to divorce her. Tiberius was so much upset, that—as Suetonius tells us—every time he met his first wife in society, he burst into tears—he, who was one of the most formidable generals of his time; so that Augustus had to take measures to prevent their meeting each other. And yet Tiberius had to give way; for his father, in the eyes of the law and in accordance with the ideas current in his time, was absolute arbiter in these matters! Not even a man in the circumstances of Tiberius, who had already been consul, could think of rebelling against the paternal authority. These few facts suffice to prove how often the ideas which to one epoch and to one civilisation seem the63 most natural, the most evident, and the most simple, are, on the contrary, complex and difficult ideas, at which mankind has arrived only after a long effort, and weary struggles. Is there anything which seems to us more reasonable than to leave to young people, who wish to found a family, ample liberty of judgment and of choice in the matter of the person with whom they will have to pass their lives? Fathers, it is true, often help their sons by giving advice. They readily place at the disposal of their children their own experience. But it is only in very rare instances that they maintain a struggle à outrance, to withhold their children from a marriage on which their hearts are set, or to force on them a repugnant alliance. We consider that the individual’s happiness may depend to some extent on his marriage. It is, therefore, just that everybody should have ample liberty of choice. If the law purported to restore to fathers the right to make or unmake their sons’ marriages, we are convinced that at the present day the vast majority of fathers would refuse to assume such a responsibility, and would consider such a power unjust, excessive, and tyrannical. There is not a father to-day who, however averse he may be to a marriage desired by his son or daughter, does not end by telling him or her, provided a little firmness is shown in resisting his arguments, that after all it is not he, but his son or daughter who has to take the husband or wife in question. Indeed, this inclination to pliability on the part of fathers towards their sons is increasing64 every day. Every day sees a growing disinclination on the part of fathers to fetter, in a matter of such delicacy and of such importance to the personal happiness of the young, the freedom of the latter’s inclinations, the spontaneous rush of their feelings. Besides, what would be the use of having conquered liberty in so many other spheres, if it were withheld in this which, especially to the young, seems the most important of all: the liberty of yielding to the impulse of that passion which at a certain moment of life is the strongest of all, love? And yet no idea would have appeared more absurd and scandalous to the men of the ancient world, the contemporaries of Pericles and Cæsar. The difference is so radical and profound that it must arise from important reasons. In fact, whoever compares ancient with modern times easily recognises that the rights of sentiment and the principles of liberty have been able to triumph in modern society only by virtue of a complete transformation in social customs and ordinances, which has stripped the family in our times of much of its social importance. To-day the family is purely and simply a form of social life in common. Man and woman cannot live solitary lives. A powerful instinct impels them towards each other. Even when the instinct is not felt, or is spent, the man needs to live in the company of other human beings, to have round him a circle of persons with whom he may find himself in relations of the closest intimacy. To-day the family performs this profoundly human office—this office and65 practically no other. Nowadays, man and woman study, work, take part in government, compete for the conquest of wealth and power, and exercise an influence on society—engage in all these activities quite outside the family. But it was not so in ancient times. The family was then an independent economic organisation, in which the woman had a predominant part. She wove and spun, providing every member of the family with clothes. She made bread, she dried the fruits for the winter, she seized the right moment for laying in the necessary supplies of provisions—a most important task, in times in which commerce was much less developed than it is now. In poor or moderately wealthy families, the women wove and performed similar tasks with their own hands. Rich women learned to do these tasks as children, but later contented themselves with superintending their performance by women slaves or freedwomen. But, especially in the rich families, the woman could contribute a great deal to the prosperity or the ruin of the house, according as she was or was not active in the performance of her work, zealous in her surveillance, energetic and shrewd in giving her orders, moderate in her expenditure. Even to-day the woman can contribute a great deal, in the wealthy classes, to the prosperity of the family. But for this she requires only one negative virtue, for all that this virtue is not too common or easily acquired: to know how to confine her expenses within reasonable limits,66 and not to be too ready to gratify her whims. In ancient times, on the contrary, if a woman was to be useful to her family she needed as well a positive virtue: to know how to produce much and well. This explains how we come to know that certain emperors’ wives, Livia for instance, directed the weaving operations in their homes personally and with great zeal, and that Augustus was particular not to wear any togas but those woven in his house under the eyes of his wife. The Emperor and his wife by their example meant to recall to all the Roman women the duty of attending with zeal and alacrity to their domestic duties. The ancient family, especially among the upper classes, was also a school. The ancient world had few institutions of public education; and private instruction did not reach a high level of development, except in the closing years of the Empire. Though Rome was the greatest military power in the world, the family took the place of military schools, which were then non-existent. The officers, who all belonged to the nobility, were prepared in the family. The father was the first military instructor of his sons, and on him fell the duty of making good soldiers of them. This, indeed, was one of the reasons why the aristocracy became indispensable to the Roman Empire; because it alone could prepare the officers and generals in the family. In short, the ancient family was a sort of political society. Its members were bound to support and help each other in difficult and dangerous contingencies, to a67 much greater extent than they are nowadays. In political struggles, for instance, they were all of one colour. It was the most difficult and unheard of thing, if indeed not impossible, for a son or a son-in-law to attach himself to a different political party from that of his father or his father-in-law. If a member of the family was implicated in a lawsuit, or financially embarrassed, the family was bound to help him much more energetically, and at much greater risk, than in our day. We see this phenomenon most clearly in Roman history. After the aristocracy split into two opposing parties,—the conservative and the popular, to borrow modern expressions,—a man’s position in one or the other party was determined, almost always, by his birth. He belonged to one party or the other, according as his own family belonged to one or the other. Take Cæsar, for example. Why was Cæsar always a member of the democratic party, and bound to follow its vicissitudes, to the extent of becoming its leader and occasioning a civil war, overturning the ancient government, and establishing a dictatorship which, reviving as it did the saddest memories of Sulla’s reaction, could not fail to be odious to the majority, and which was the cause of Cæsar’s death? It was not the result of any special inclination or ambition of his own. Several times he tried to cross over to the other party, which had much more power and authority; or at any rate, to reach an understanding with it. But his effort was of no avail. He was68 the nephew of Marius, the most celebrated among the leaders of the popular party, and the one whom the other party most detested. The first impulse towards the whole of the great dictator’s extraordinary career was given by this relationship; he had in the end to bring about a second revolution, because his uncle had already caused one. It is easy then to understand for what reason, in times in which the family performed so many social offices and was the pivot of so many interests, marriage was not considered as an act to be left to the full discretion of the young and to their love, and why the fathers were conceded the right to decide for themselves in such matters. A marriage involved grave political, economic, and moral responsibilities for the members of both clans. Therefore the young people were required to sacrifice to the common interests of their clan some part of their personal inclinations. In compensation, they had the advantage, in case of danger and of need, of being able to count on the family much more than they can nowadays; the family arrogated to itself, it is true, certain rights in connection with their choice, but in return did not abandon them to their fate in the hour of need.",
        "target_summary": "A papyrus from 2nd century A.D. Egypt, known as *The Petition of Dionysia*, reveals a legal case where Dionysia contested her father's right to dissolve her marriage and reclaim her dowry. Her father had attempted to end her \"unwritten\" marriage, but Dionysia argued her \"written\" marriage meant he had forfeited that right. This ancient concept, where a father could dissolve his child's marriage on a whim, stands in stark contrast to modern European and American views, which consider marriage a state-regulated institution and personal choice.\n\nThe text highlights that throughout antiquity, marriage was not an act left to the contracting parties' will but a transaction arranged by fathers. In Rome, fathers betrothed children young and could compel divorce at any time without reason. Even Tiberius, a powerful figure, was forced by his adoptive father Augustus to divorce his beloved wife for political reasons, demonstrating the absolute paternal authority over marriage regardless of a child's age or status.\n\nThe modern belief in personal liberty and choice in marriage, particularly regarding love, is a relatively recent development. Today, fathers largely defer to their children's choices, finding the idea of forcing or preventing a marriage unjust and tyrannical.\n\nThis radical difference stems from a profound transformation in social customs. In ancient times, the family held immense social importance, performing numerous roles that are now largely externalized.\n1.  **Economic:** The ancient family was an independent economic unit where women were crucial producers (weaving, food preparation, supply management), not just managers of expenses. This made a wife's productivity vital to the household's prosperity, as exemplified by Empress Livia overseeing Augustus's clothing production.\n2.  **Educational:** The family served as a primary educational institution, especially for military training among the nobility, with fathers instructing their sons in preparation for leadership.\n3.  **Political and Social Support:** Family members were bound by strong ties, offering mutual support in legal, financial, and political matters. Political allegiance was often determined by family ties, as seen in Caesar's career being shaped by his familial connection to Marius, a leader of the popular party.\n\nGiven these extensive responsibilities and interests, ancient societies viewed marriage as a serious political, economic, and moral arrangement for the entire clan. Therefore, young people were expected to sacrifice personal inclinations for the common good of the family, receiving in return a powerful support system in times of need.",

        "content": "In short, the ancient marriage, organised though it was on lines which appear to us tyrannical, presented certain advantages which, if considered carefully, will be seen to compensate, at least in part, for the restricted69 liberty of choice. In the great transformation of civilisation of which the modern marriage is the product, men have, it is true, gained, on the one hand, greater liberty, but have lost, on the other, certain advantages which, in the ancient world, were guaranteed to them by the closer and more vigorous solidarity of the family. Women, on the contrary, have gained much more in the passage from the ancient to the modern world, because in exchange for what they have gained, they have lost practically nothing. The organisation of the modern family is distinguished from that of the ancient especially by the much greater concessions it makes to the woman. Feminists complain loudly of the present condition of woman. It is certain, however, at least to anyone with any knowledge of the history of the past, that at no epoch have women been so little oppressed by men and at no epoch have they enjoyed so many advantages as at present. In fact, if in the ancient marriage so little liberty of choice was reserved to the man, it is easy to understand that not a ghost of it was conceded to the woman. The man had in addition one advantage. Constrained to submit to the will of the father as long as the latter was alive, he became, when the father died, absolute master of his wife, because he could then repudiate her and marry another, how and when he chose. The almost unfettered liberty of divorce, without any motive, or for the most futile motives, might well be some compensation to the man for the subjection in which the70 father, while alive, kept him. For the woman, there was no compensation at all. As long as her father lived, she had to obey the man to whom her father gave her. When the father was no more, she still remained in the power of her husband, who could not only repudiate her without any motive, but even marry her to another. In the history of Rome, especially, the men used and abused this privilege in a way, which to us seems sometimes ridiculous, sometimes revolting, and always extravagant. Especially in the last century of the republic, when the struggles between the parties became intense, the most eminent statesmen adopted the habit of consolidating their alliances with marriages. Therefore, we see every political vicissitude of importance shrouded in a curious web of divorces and marriages. Now one great man hands his wife over to another, now he marries the other’s daughter, now gives him his sister to wife. The poor women wander from one house to the other, change husbands from one year to another, with the same facility with which, nowadays, a traveller changes his inn. For all these marriages lasted only as long as the political combination on account of which they were entered into. When the combination was dissolved, divorce broke up all or most of these families, and the husbands set themselves to contract new marriages. It was so easy for the husband to get a divorce. He needed only to write his wife a letter announcing his intention! Life, then, was bound to be not over-agreeable in71 Cæsar’s time for an affectionate, delicate, virtuous woman who desired the quiet joys of family life. When we contemplate from afar the historical grandeur and the glory of ancient Rome, we ought not to forget the multitude of hapless women which Rome was forced to sacrifice—a precious holocaust indeed—to her fortune and power. How many women’s broken hearts, how many women’s shattered lives went to make up the foundations of Roman grandeur! Nevertheless, even the greatest evils are never without some small admixture of good; and that sorrowful plight of woman in ancient times, especially of the Roman woman, was offset by one advantage of which liberty has robbed the woman of to-day. That is, that in ancient times, a woman, whether fair or plain, clever or foolish, attractive or insipid, was certain to be married, and that too while she was still young. The husband could not choose her; but she was sure of finding him, and that without undue delay. In fact, nowhere in the ancient world do we find any striking traces of a feminine celibacy like that which existed later under the influence of Christianity in the convents, or like that which is to-day again coming into prominence for social and economic reasons, without any religious impress or need of monastic vows, especially in the great industrial countries. It seems that women of the upper and middle classes, if they were not positively deformed and physically unsuited for matrimony, all married. Furthermore, inasmuch as marriages,72 especially among the upper classes, were arranged from political and social motives, no account was taken of the beauty of the bride, but of her social position, her family, and so on. Historians always tell us how many wives the numerous prominent figures in Roman history married, and to what families they belonged. But it is rare for them to tell us whether they were beautiful or ugly, intelligent or stupid, pleasing or unpleasing; these details seemed to them of but trifling importance. One of the few exceptions to this rule is Livia, the last wife of Augustus. All the writers vie in celebrating her rare beauty (to which the statues also bear witness), her wisdom, intelligence, and virtue. But Livia seems really to have been a miracle; for it is a fact that, having married Augustus in her earliest youth, she succeeded in living with him all her life. Fifteen or sixteen years was considered the suitable age for a bride. Sometimes girls were married when they were barely fourteen, while nowadays it is rare for a girl to marry before she is twenty, and the majority marry between the ages of twenty and thirty. Furthermore, in many states of the ancient world the legal age for matrimony, both for the woman and the man, was much lower than it is to-day in European and American legal codes. This is not surprising. In all times and in all places in which matrimony is considered not as a personal matter of sentiment, but as a social act which must be regulated and directed by the parents, the object is to marry off the young people as73 quickly as possible. Often they are actually betrothed when they are still children, and share each other’s games of running and jumping. This was a fairly common practice in ancient Rome amongst the nobility, as it is a thriving custom in the China of to-day. Nor is it difficult to understand the reason for this procedure, which, considered by itself, seems to us extravagant and senseless. Love in all times and in all places is a most intractable passion. It is, therefore, more easy in such matters, for the elders to impose their wills and cold-blooded arrangements, on girls of fourteen or fifteen and boys of seventeen or eighteen, than on women or men of twenty-five. Naturally such precocious marriages, contracted between young people who had not yet had a taste of the world, were not free from dangers and serious inconveniences. But these dangers and inconveniences appeared to contemporary eyes less great than those which would have arisen, if the young had been left to follow the dictates of their own feelings. In conclusion, another advantage which the ancient marriage, with all its many hardships and its want of sympathy, assured to the woman was what one might call the legal protection of virtue. Nowhere was this protection greater and stronger than in ancient Rome. In Rome, the legitimacy of a marriage did not depend, as it does now in Europe and America, on the fulfilment of certain formalities before a priest or a magistrate, but on the moral situation of the woman. An ingenua74 et honesta woman, to use the expression then current, meaning a free-born woman of irreproachable habits, could live with a man only in the capacity of his legitimate wife. No formality in the presence of any magistrate was required. The fact of living with a man and being ingenua et honesta sufficed to assure to a woman and her own children all the rights appertaining to a wife and to legitimate offspring. On the other hand, a woman who had lived a dissolute life, had engaged in certain employments considered, and justly considered, disgraceful for a woman, or who had been convicted of adultery, could never become a legitimate wife or enjoy the privileges and rights of a legitimate wife. There was no ceremony before a priest or magistrate which could make a legitimate wife of her. She was by law a concubina, and in that capacity for a long time had no rights. Only in the course of time could she hope to get the rights, much restricted and of little importance as they were, which the law gradually conceded to the concubina. To transport this ancient conception of matrimony into modern society would doubtless not be possible, because it contradicts the great democratic principle of the equality of all before the law, on which our social organisation rests. But considered by itself this ancient conception of matrimony is without a doubt more lofty and more noble, and in particular more favourable to the woman, than the modern one. For it did not reduce the status of legitimate wife to what is practically75 a formality, but made it the exclusive privilege of the virtuous woman, and therefore assured the virtuous woman of a kind of privileged legal position, protecting her effectively against the intrigues and seductions of the attractive and gay women who, in the modern régime, are usually the more dangerous to the peace and happiness of the virtuous women, the less austere are their habits. In ancient Rome, the law guaranteed the virtuous woman that at least no one of these women should be able to rob her of the post of honour which she occupied in the family. The comparison of the ancient marriage with the modern marriage once more proves to us, then, how complex are human affairs, and how difficult it is to pass an absolute and definitive judgment upon them. Certainly, at first sight, the condition of the woman in the ancient family seems to us a horrible one, resembling that of a slave. We wonder how nations that had risen to a lofty level of social, intellectual, and moral development could have tolerated it. But when we consider the matter more attentively, we find that even this condition, wretched though it was in certain respects, was not without certain advantages, which may perhaps explain to us why women put up with it for so many centuries. The liberty which the woman of the present day enjoys has countless advantages; but it has made matrimony for her a struggle, in which, if some triumph, others are worsted, and those who triumph are not always the most virtuous and the most wise.76 Also, in this order of things, liberty is an excellent thing, especially for the fortunate and the brave; but the fortunate and the brave, where marriages and love are concerned, are not always those who possess the qualities which conduce most effectively to the progress of the world and the improvement of the human species. Modern liberty has set a high price on beauty and intelligence in woman, which is all to the good; but it has also made coquetry, frivolity, and vapidity into qualities which are useful for the conquest of man, who is not always a reasonable being and is even less reasonable than usual when he is in love—which is not all to the good. For there is no doubt that between twenty and thirty years of age a man is much more sensitive to the attractions of a frivolous and seductive girl than to those of a serious and sensible woman. All human things, then, have their advantages and their disadvantages, and that perhaps is why the world never tires of its experiments in diverse directions and on every topic. Absolute perfection is unattainable—a fact which should make us careful not to boast too loudly of the times in which we live, nor to be too ready to disparage what preceding generations have done.",
        "target_summary": "While seemingly tyrannical, ancient marriage offered certain advantages that partially offset restricted liberty. Modern marriage provides greater liberty, yet men have lost some family solidarity, while women have gained significantly more without substantial losses. Despite feminist complaints, women today are arguably less oppressed and enjoy more advantages than at any previous time.\n\nIn ancient times, women had virtually no choice in marriage. While men were subject to their fathers, they gained absolute control over their wives upon the father's death, with the freedom to easily repudiate and remarry. This near-unfettered divorce liberty served as a compensation for men's earlier subjugation. Women, however, had no such recourse, remaining under the authority of their fathers and then their husbands, who could repudiate them or marry them to others. Roman history, particularly during the late Republic, illustrates this with eminent statesmen frequently divorcing and remarrying for political alliances, treating women as interchangeable assets. This subjected women to constant changes of husbands and homes, creating immense hardship.\n\nHowever, even this harsh system held an advantage for ancient women: the certainty of marriage at a young age, regardless of beauty, intellect, or charm. Marriages, especially among upper classes, were often arranged for social or political reasons, making a woman's status and family more important than her personal attributes. This contrasted with later and modern celibacy trends. Furthermore, ancient Rome offered \"legal protection of virtue.\" Marriage legitimacy depended not on formalities but on a woman's moral standing. An \"ingenua et honesta\" (free-born, irreproachable) woman living with a man was automatically his legitimate wife, securing her rights and those of her children. Conversely, a dissolute woman could only be a concubina with few rights. While incompatible with modern democratic equality, this ancient concept was considered more noble and advantageous to virtuous women, protecting their honored position against the intrigues of less austere women.\n\nUltimately, human affairs are complex, making absolute judgments difficult. Though the ancient woman's condition seems horrific, it provided certain benefits like guaranteed matrimony. Modern liberty offers numerous advantages but has also turned marriage into a struggle for women, where success doesn't always favor the virtuous. Modern society, while valuing beauty and intelligence, also makes superficial qualities like coquetry useful for attracting men, who are not always rational, especially in love. All human systems possess both advantages and disadvantages, a fact that should temper any absolute praise for the present or dismissal of the past.",

        "content": "“L’histoire est un recommencement perpétuel,” a French writer has said. If the forms in which history manifests itself are infinitely various, the forces which inspire it are always the same, and are everywhere at work, on a large scale or on a small, openly or secretly. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that the decadence of the Roman Empire is being repeated in our time in the modern world. This assertion may seem paradoxical and strange. What! are we moderns on the downward grade? Why, one hears of nothing but progress on every side. Never was there an epoch more proud of its loudly vaunted achievements. The sciences are adding discovery to discovery. The wealth of the world is increasing with giddy rapidity. Comfort and culture are spreading in every class and in every country. One after another, most recondite treasures of the earth are falling into our hands. We are gradually fighting down all the forces of nature which for so long a time kept our ancestors at a distance, impeded them, even threatened78 them with death, from the law of gravity to the most insidious maladies. Is it permissible to talk of decadence at the very moment when man has made himself lord of the whole earth, and is even learning to fly? History cannot show a richer, wiser, more powerful, more daring epoch than the present one. No wonder that most people would resent the suggestion that we, in the flush of our brilliant successes, are seeing the repetition of that ancient and terrible history of the last centuries of the Roman Empire, which was one of the saddest and deadliest episodes in the world’s history. And yet that history is repeating itself, to a certain extent at any rate. The showy wealth and the noisy triumphs of modern civilisation veil, but do not hide, this recommencement de l’histoire from him who studies, in a spirit of philosophy, our times and the decadence of the Roman Empire. It is true that there are immense differences between the two civilisations and the two epochs. But notwithstanding these differences, what wonderful resemblances there are! Consider especially that disease which corrupted the trunk of the Roman Empire, and which is beginning slowly, subtly, insidiously to eat the heart out of the modern world. The disease which killed the Roman Empire was, in fact, excessive urbanisation. Neither the attacks of barbarism from outside, nor those of Christianity from within, would have prevailed against its might and its massive weight, if the strength of the colossus had not been already undermined by this internal cancer. But,79 slowly and steadily, the disease had spread through the trunk of the Empire, and had attacked its most vital organs one after the other, fostered on its deadly errand by wealth, peace, art, literature, culture, religion, all the blessings which men most long for and most prize. In order to understand this extraordinary phenomenon of Roman history, we must hark back to the generations that lived quietly and in a relatively happy state in the flowery times of Rome’s real power and greatness. After two centuries of war, at the beginning of the Christian era, peace was finally established in the great Empire which Rome had conquered. In the days of peace, the barbarian West learned from the Romans how to cultivate the earth, to cut the forests, to excavate the minerals, to navigate the rivers, to speak and to write Latin. It became civilised, and bought the manufactures of the ancient industrial cities of the East. Every fresh market of the West, as it was opened up, gave a stimulus to the ancient industries of the East, which found in such market a new clientèle. Contact with the barbarism of the West rapidly gave fresh youth to the old civilisation of the East,—Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor,—which had decayed somewhat in the great crisis of the last century of the republic. Everywhere fresh lands were brought under cultivation, methods of agriculture were perfected, minerals were searched for, new industries and new branches of commerce were opened up. Prosperity and luxury preceding in every nation, even the most barbarous,80 and in every class, even the poorest, which acquired a taste for the luxuries of civilisation. An epoch of rapid increase of wealth, of lucky enterprises, of frequent, close, and varied commercial and intellectual intercourse between the most distant peoples, began. In every part of the Empire, in Gaul as well as in Asia Minor, in Spain as well as in Africa, these new trades, these new industries and agricultural enterprises gave rise to a prosperous middle class and to provincial aristocracies,—nouveaux riches families,—which gradually came to form the governing class of the Empire, migrated to the cities, strode to enlarge them, to embellish them, and to make them more comfortable, reproducing in every part of the Empire the splendours of the urban civilisation after the Greco-Asiatic model as perfected by the practical Roman spirit of organisation. In every province, the example of the Emperor in Rome found imitators. In the first and second centuries, every rich family spent part of its possessions on the embellishment of the cities, and made provision for the common people of profits, comforts, and pleasures: they built palaces, villas, theatres, temples, baths, and aqueducts. They distributed grain, oil, amusements, and money. They endowed public services and assumed the rôle of pious founders. The Empire covered itself with cities great and small, rivalling each other in splendour and wealth; and into these cities, at the expense of depopulating the countryside where nobody was willing any longer to live, it81 attracted the peasantry, the village artisans, and the yeomanry. In these cities, schools were opened in which the youth of the middle class were taught eloquence, literature, and philosophy, and trained for official posts, the number of which increased from generation to generation, and for the liberal professions. Thus, in the second century A.D., the Empire spread, in the sun of the pax Romana, which illumined the world, its countless marble-decked cities, as our time spreads, in the sun of modern civilisation, the confused and smoky opulence of its cities, large and moderate-sized, crowded, disordered, a blaze of light by night, bristling with chimneys and shrouded in black fog by day. In other words, the most important phenomenon in the whole history of the Roman Empire, during the first two centuries of the Christian era, is, as in the nineteenth century, the rapid growth and enrichment of the cities. The phenomenon was not then so rapid nor on so large a scale as it is to-day; not a single city in the Empire, not even Rome, ever attained, in my opinion, a population of one million inhabitants. The cities which seemed big in those days would be only of moderate size now. Populations and riches were smaller. But the phenomenon in itself was the same. From the third century onwards, the excessive urbanisation in the Roman Empire, which had been the cause of the splendour and apparent wealth of the preceding century, began to change into a dissolving82 force, which drove that brilliant world back into the chaos from which urbanisation had evolved it. Little by little, the expenditure of the urban civilisation, the cities and their increasing luxury, out-distanced the fertility of the countryside, and, from that moment, the latter began to be depopulated and sterilised by the cities. With each succeeding generation, the impulse towards the cities became stronger. The numbers and the requirements of the modern population increased. The State and the wealthy classes were inundated with requests, prayers, and threats, urging them to satisfy these requirements, to adorn and enrich ever more and more the cities, which were the glory and splendour of the Empire.",
        "target_summary": "A French writer noted that \"history is a perpetual recommencement,\" driven by consistent underlying forces despite varied forms. Thus, the author argues, the decadence of the Roman Empire is paradoxically repeating in the modern world, despite widespread belief in constant progress. Modern society boasts unprecedented achievements in science, wealth, comfort, and mastery over nature, making the idea of decline seem absurd. However, the author insists these triumphs merely veil a repeating history.\n\nThe key \"disease\" that undermined the Roman Empire was **excessive urbanization**, not external barbarian attacks or internal Christian influence. This internal cancer was, ironically, fostered by Rome's blessings of wealth, peace, art, and culture.\n\nFollowing two centuries of conflict, the *Pax Romana* brought peace, stimulating immense economic growth. The barbarian West became civilized, adopting Roman agricultural and industrial practices, fostering trade with the ancient industrial East. This widespread prosperity led to a rapid increase in wealth, commerce, and intellectual exchange across the Empire. A new prosperous middle class and provincial aristocracies emerged, mimicking Rome's urban splendor. Wealthy families heavily invested in cities, building public amenities like palaces, theaters, baths, and distributing resources, creating a network of rivalrous, magnificent urban centers. This growth attracted peasants, artisans, and yeomanry from the countryside, which subsequently became depopulated. Cities also became hubs for education and official administrative posts.\n\nThis rapid growth and enrichment of cities during the first two centuries CE, though on a smaller scale than today's megacities, represents the same core phenomenon. However, by the 3rd century, this excessive urbanization transformed into a destructive force. The escalating expenditures and luxurious demands of the cities began to outstrip the fertility and resources of the countryside, leading to its depopulation and sterilization. With each generation, the urban impulse strengthened, increasing demands on the State and the wealthy to continue adorning and enriching the cities, despite the dwindling rural support.",

        "content": "In order to feed, amuse, and clothe crowded city-populations; to carry through the construction of the magnificent monuments whose ruins we still admire; to provide work for the industries and arts of the cities,—agriculture was, little by little, ground down by ever-increasing burdens. The position of the peasant, in the solitude of the depopulated countryside, became ever more sad and gloomy, just as the cities became fairer, bigger, fuller of amusement and festivals. The impulse towards the cities increased, and one day the Empire awoke to find that its cities were swarming with beggars, idlers, vagabonds, masons, plasterers, sculptors, painters, dancers, actors, singers—in short, the whole tribe of the artisans of pleasure and of luxury. But in the fields, which were expected to feed all these83 men who had crowded into the cities to work or to idle, there was a dearth of peasants to cultivate the land. Also, with the disappearance of the rural population, the problem of recruiting the army, which drew its soldiers then, as always, from the country, became increasingly serious. While the cities tricked themselves out with magnificent monuments, the Empire was threatened with a dearth of bread and of soldiers. It must be owned that the Empire struggled against this menace with desperate vigour. It introduced the villeinage of the soil. It tried to bind the peasants to the land. It established heredity of trade or calling. But the effort was fruitless. Aggravated by one of the most tremendous intellectual blunders in the annals of history, the crisis became insoluble. The agriculture of the Empire, and with it the Empire itself, received its death-blow. The East and the West split apart, and, left to itself, the West went to pieces. The greatest of the works of Rome, the Empire founded by her in Europe, including the immense territory bounded by the Rhine and the Danube, lay a vast ruin: a ruin of shattered monuments, of peoples relapsed into barbarism, of perished arts, of forgotten tongues, of laws thrown to the four winds, of roads, villages, cities razed from the face of the earth, swallowed up in the primeval forest which slowly and tenaciously thrust out its tentacles, in that cemetery of a past civilisation, and entwined the giant bones of Rome! But the reader will say: “But that is not happening,84 and never will happen, to contemporary civilisation. Even if it cannot be denied that there is a certain analogy between the history of the first two centuries of the Empire and that of modern times, the analogy stops short at this point. The world will never witness another catastrophe like that of the Roman Empire; or at any rate, nobody now alive will witness it.” I heartily concur in this opinion. Modern civilisation will resist the ills which assail it better than ancient civilisation resisted them. But it will be able to do so because it is stronger, not because it does not contain within itself the germ of the cancer which destroyed the Roman world. Many symptoms prove this. I will dilate upon one of them only, the most serious, the most salient, the most generally recognised and felt, even though few up to the present have seen in it an analogy and a resemblance to the great historical crisis of the fall of the Roman Empire. I refer to the rise in the cost of living. To-day, Europe and America resound from one end to another with a chorus of complaints from men and women who have to live in the cities. Rent, bread, milk, meat, vegetables, eggs, clothes—everything, in short, is rising in price. Even people in the thirties can remember having witnessed times of fable, a kind of mythical golden age, in which things were worth practically nothing compared with their price to-day. Governments are besieged with entreaties, threats, and prayers to provide supplies, but they do not know how85 to do so. What is the cause, what the remedy, of this strange phenomenon? Some lay the blame on the taxes; some on Protection; some on the merchants and speculators. And indeed, at first sight, the phenomenon seems inexplicable. At no period of history was there such a determined rush to make money as at the present time. No age had at its disposal so many and such effective means of making it. The men of to-day are obsessed to such an extent by the frenzy for work that they no longer have time to live. Statistics tell us in exact figures the yearly increase in the production of the world. So the earth ought to be wallowing in abundance, an abundance such as the world has never seen heretofore. How comes it, then, that men everywhere complain, and most loudly in the richest countries, of the intolerable dearness of everything? What is the object, what the effect, of the work of the man of to-day, if not abundance but scarcity is the recompense of daily toil? This scarcity is a graver and more complex phenomenon than those who most complain of it suppose, and is not the fault of government or traders. It is a veritable recommencement de l’histoire, and the study of the Roman Empire can be of the greatest service in helping us to understand it. It is the first serious, universally felt symptom of that excessive urbanisation which was the ruin of ancient Rome. This modern society arises from the over-development of the cities,86 from the too rapid increase in the needs and luxuries of the multitudes who live in the cities. Men and money concentrate in the cities, and swell the urban industries and luxury, public and private, intent on putting into operation all the marvels which the fertile modern genius, inspired by competition in the race for progress, is continually inventing. The countryside, on the other hand, has in the last half-century been left too much to itself, and agriculture has been too much neglected, exactly as began to be the case in the Roman Empire at the beginning of the second century of the Christian era. It is easy to guess what must be the natural consequence of this lop-sided arrangement. The cities grow bigger; industries increase in number and in size; the luxury and the needs of the masses, crowded together in the cities, augment. On the other hand, there is no proportionate increase in the productiveness of the land. And so the increase in wealth is accompanied by an increasing scarcity of the fruits of the earth; and the things which serve to clothe and feed us—cotton, linen, hemp, wool, cereals, meat, vegetables—nearly all rise in price much more than do manufactured goods. This explains the scarcity that vexes the cities in proportion to their growth in size. In no country is this phenomenon more apparent and interesting than in the United States. Which of the nations of the world could more easily revel in the most marvellous abundance of everything which it is possible87 to conceive? The United States has no lack of territories to cultivate; or of capital, which accumulates every year in immeasurable quantity; or of strong arms, Europe providing her with immigrants in the prime of life; or of the spirit of enterprise and of untiring energy. And yet, in no country of Europe are complaints of the expense of living more generally and loudly raised than in the United States. Why? Because in America the disproportion between the progress of the country and that of the cities, between industrial progress and agricultural progress, is even greater than in Europe, the home of populations which for centuries have been accustomed to a country life. Consequently the scarcity is greater and more vexatious in the United States, because the wealth of that country is greater than that of Europe. Someone will say: “However that may be, if this scarcity which we are experiencing is the most obvious symptom of the excessive urbanisation from which our civilisation is suffering, the suffering cannot be a very serious matter; it must be far from assuming the grave and dangerous aspect which it bore in the time of the Roman Empire. So in this respect also we can consider ourselves lucky; this excessive urbanisation does not cause us more than a certain material uneasiness, which is felt by the middle and lower classes in the cities. In the Roman Empire, on the other hand, it produced a historical catastrophe.” All that is true, without a doubt, but precisely on this account ought88 the lesson, with which the history of the fall of the Roman Empire is pregnant, to be read and pondered. In the Roman Empire, too, for a long time, just as now in Europe and America, this excessive urbanisation only occasioned a by-no-means intolerable material uneasiness to the most numerous and poorest classes of town-dweller. In the first and second centuries,—that is to say, in the two most prosperous and splendid centuries of the Empire,—numerous inscriptions remind us of gifts made by rich citizens or precautions taken by the cities to meet the scarcity of victuals which pressed hard upon the poorer classes. It is scarcely necessary to mention Rome in this connection, so notorious is the fact. From the day when it became the metropolis of a vast Empire, the scarcity of victuals became a permanent feature of the city; and the State had to furnish the city with the famous frumentationes, which were, in the last two centuries of the Republic and throughout the Empire, one of Rome’s most serious preoccupations. Mistress of a mighty Empire, Rome was for centuries sure of being obeyed in the most distant provinces by the people that her sword had conquered; but there was never a day in the year when she was sure of keeping the wolf from the door! In the Roman Empire also, then, for a long time the excessive urbanisation made itself felt in the shape of a troublesome, but by no means intolerable, rise in the cost of living in the cities. Why did it gradually bring about a terrific social dissolution? Because the Roman89 Empire, instead of leaving its cities to fight down this evil, tried to abolish it by artificial means; and those artificial means it applied ever more and more extensively, the more serious the evil became. The crisis of the cities of the Empire began in the third century, which saw the depopulation of the countryside, and the diminution of agricultural production, while in the cities, on the other hand, victuals were rising in price, and the number of beggars was increasing in a most alarming way. If the State had allowed this crisis to run its natural course, what would have happened? Of course things would of themselves have regained their equilibrium little by little. Part of the urban proletariat, unable to live in the overcrowded cities, and seeing themselves condemned to a sort of chronic famine and gradual extinction, would have returned to work in the fields. When the drain on the population of the countryside becomes too great, the evil admits of only one remedy: and that is, that life in the cities should be allowed to become unbearable to a certain number of the citizens, so that they may be tempted to exchange it for life and work in the fields. But the Roman State could not bring itself to let the evil follow its natural course. The large cities, beginning with Rome, had too great influence with the Government; and throughout the Empire the city beautiful and rich had come to represent the model of civilisation. Little by little, the State let itself be persuaded to do for each of its cities what it had done for90 Rome ever since its earliest conception of a world-policy under the delusion that it could thus stave off the impending crisis. With a view to easing the misery of the urban proletariat, it took public works in hand in every direction, regardless of their utility. It distributed victuals free or at half-price. It multiplied philanthropic institutions and encouraged the wealthy families to imitate and to assist it. But all these schemes cost money, which the State could secure only by increasing the taxes on agriculture, while the wealthy families had to spend in the cities the bulk of the wealth which they derived from their country property. The result was that life was artificially made easier and more comfortable in the cities, and harder and more difficult in the country, whereas the natural trend of circumstances would have produced the opposite effect. The evil, treated in so ridiculous a way, became worse. The exodus of the peasants into the cities increased, and brought a corresponding increase in the demands on the public purse for the amelioration of the conditions of city life. The intensification of the evil was met by an increase in the dose of the very remedy which aggravated it—useless expenditure in the cities, ruinous taxes on agriculture. Matters went from worse to worse, until the system reached the limit of its elasticity, and the whole social fabric collapsed in a colossal catastrophe. This is precisely the mistake which modern civilisation must learn to avoid. The catastrophe of the91 Roman Empire teaches us moderns one lesson: and that is, that the evil from which the great cities of the civil world are suffering at present is a salutary, health-giving, and beneficent visitation. For it puts a natural brake on the growth of cities and of their luxury, and keeps the population in the fields, where the rise in the price of living brings profit, greater comfort, and improved living in its train. It is, in short, the vis medicatrix naturæ, which tends to restore the balance between agriculture and industry, between the city and the country, a balance which the development of modern civilisation has upset. Therefore all the artificial measures which pretend to mitigate this evil, at the very moment when the force of circumstances demands that this development shall stop, must be pernicious. While they tide over a trifling evil of the moment, they lay up for the future troubles and difficulties and dangers of infinitely greater gravity. Even if modern civilisation adopted in its entirety the policy pursued by the Roman Empire, and tried to eradicate the evil with the same deadly artificial measures which only aggravated it, there would still doubtless be no ground for fearing a catastrophe in the future analogous to that which overwhelmed Greco-Roman civilisation. Modern civilisation is too vast, too powerful, too deep-rooted, to have any fear of a similar fate. But if not destroyed, modern civilisation might be profoundly shaken and weakened in the event of its imitating the policy of Rome and seeking to favour the92 cities overmuch at the expense of the country;—all the more shaken and weakened, because, dazzled as we all are by the triumphs of the world in which we live, and by the surface marks of its powers and grandeur, it is much more difficult for us than it was for the ancients in a similar case to discern the signs of old age in it, and the cracks which are spreading in the edifice in which we live. There is a further lesson to be learned by us moderns from the history of the decadence of the Roman Empire: and that is, not to mistake the glamour of the external manifestations of wealth and power for signs of real wealth and power. A civilisation is not always in reality richer and stronger in times when it bears the most visible marks of so being; we are rather apt to find that, when it is most dazzling in outward seeming, its decadence has already begun. We often halt in stupefaction and admiration before the great ruins of ancient Rome, especially those offered by the European provinces of the Empire. We think how great, powerful, and rich must have been the Empire which could rear monuments so massive that all the centuries have not been able to sweep them entirely from the face of the earth. And yet, if we are to look at these relics in their right light, we must remember that practically all the great Roman monuments whose remains survive to our day on a large scale, belong to the third, fourth, and fifth centuries of the Christian era—to the centuries of decadence and dissolution. As the Empire weakens93 and ages, its monuments become more and more elaborate and colossal. A fairly safe rule for guessing the century to which Roman monuments belong is to assume that the more imposing the ruins, the later is the epoch to which they should be attributed.",
        "target_summary": "The Roman Empire's decline stemmed from excessive urbanization and neglect of agriculture. As cities grew to feed, amuse, and house their populations, agriculture was burdened, leading to depopulation of the countryside. This created a dual crisis: a dearth of peasants to cultivate land for food and a shortage of recruits for the army, while cities became crowded with artisans of luxury and pleasure. Despite the Empire's desperate efforts to bind peasants to the land and establish hereditary trades, the crisis deepened, aggravated by \"intellectual blunders,\" ultimately causing the Empire's collapse and the West's descent into ruin.\n\nThe author argues that while modern civilization is stronger and unlikely to suffer an identical catastrophe, it shares a \"germ of the cancer\" that destroyed Rome: excessive urbanization. The most salient symptom today is the widespread rise in the cost of living—rent, food, and other necessities—despite increased production. This phenomenon is not due to taxes or speculators, but is a \"recommencement de l’histoire\" rooted in the over-development of cities. Men and money concentrate in urban centers, boosting industries and luxuries, while the countryside and agriculture are neglected. This imbalance leads to a disproportionate increase in the price of agricultural products compared to manufactured goods, causing scarcity, particularly evident in rapidly developing nations like the United States.\n\nCritics might argue that modern scarcity is merely a \"material uneasiness,\" not a grave threat. However, the author points out that in the Roman Empire, this same \"uneasiness\" persisted for centuries, with the State providing provisions to the urban poor. Rome's fatal mistake was attempting to artificially abolish the problem instead of allowing it to run its natural course. Had urban life become unbearable, some proletariat would have returned to the fields, restoring balance. Instead, the Roman State undertook public works, distributed free victuals, and encouraged philanthropy, all funded by increased taxes on agriculture. This artificially eased urban life while making rural life harder, exacerbating the peasant exodus and intensifying the problem until the entire social fabric collapsed.\n\nModern civilization must learn from this. The rising cost of living is a \"salutary\" signal, a natural brake on urban growth that encourages population to remain in or return to the fields, thereby restoring balance between agriculture and industry. Artificial measures to alleviate this \"evil\" are pernicious, solving minor immediate problems but creating far greater future dangers. While modern civilization may not be destroyed, imitating Rome's policy of favoring cities at the expense of the countryside could profoundly weaken it. The author also warns against mistaking external grandeur for true strength, noting that Rome's most colossal monuments were built during its centuries of decline, not its peak, suggesting visible wealth can paradoxically signify impending decadence.",

        "title": "THE LESSON OF THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE",
        "content": "For Rome herself, the time of the greatest expansion, splendour, and population was the middle of the fourth century—that is to say, when her decadence was already far advanced. Not till then did Rome become, for the number and size of her temples, the magnificence of her baths, her basilicas, and her private palaces, for the beauty of her public gardens, for her size and population, the first and most marvellous city of the Empire: the portent which evokes the admiration of the whole world. How much smaller, on the other hand, how much more simple and modest was she in the first century, a time when the Empire really was at its most flourishing epoch, with its frontiers safe, its population on the up-grade, its cities developing themselves by a process of growth which was still a perfectly natural one, agriculture, trade, and industries in a sound condition, and the State well organised and strong. Nor is this a historical paradox. It is only what always happens to a greater or less extent. In families as in nations and civilisations, ostentation, display, the doing on a grand scale everything, even what might be done on a small scale without detriment, or even advantageously, are a sign of decadence rather than of progress. The passion for the colossal and the enormous94 is not a healthy passion, nor does it flourish in epochs of strength and sound moral and social equilibrium; it is a passion which thrives in epochs of decadence, epochs convulsed by a deep-seated disproportion between desires and reality, a thirst for excitements and violent sensations, lavish in the expenditure of labour and of wealth to procure a fallacious illusion of grandeur and power, spurred on by a spirit of rivalry and of competition which easily degenerates into false pride. Not the least of the causes contributing to the maintenance and increase in the ancient cities of that sumptuousness of festivals, ceremonies, and monuments which gradually ruined the Roman Empire was the rivalry between the big, the medium-sized, and the small cities of the Empire, between provinces and districts, between classes, families, professions, sects, and religions. When a city built a theatre, or baths, or a basilica, at once her sister-cities wanted one too, as big or bigger. If a rich family built or endowed a temple or baths, the other families wished to do the same or more. There was a continual competition between the religions to have the finest temple or the most sumptuous ceremonial. That explains why a little city like Verona, for instance, has an enormous amphitheatre, in which the whole population of the city could be accommodated several times over. That explains why the provinces, the cities and private individuals, in this competition of display and magnificence, all showered enormous wealth on that display, wealth which would have been better95 spent in defending the Empire or in preserving its economic resources. Many of those remains which evoke our admiration to-day meant, in the days when they reared their proud bulk to the sky, the ruin of the Empire! And now let us search our own consciences. Can we honestly declare that our epoch is untainted by this mania for grandeur and display, this spirit of sterile public and private rivalry, which caused the ancient Roman Empire to squander such vast treasures, and cloaked its fatal decadence with a vesture of splendour? I cannot suppose that our freedom from such taint would be maintained by anyone who remarked the headlong growth of public and private luxury, the ever swelling vanity of nations, professions, and classes, the tendency to mistake in everything the grandeur of colossal proportions for the grandeur of intrinsic virtue. Whoever casts his eyes around him, in America as well as in Europe, sees this impression gaining ground on all sides and acquiring force. It fouls the stream of politics, religion, literature, philosophy and art. It corrupts or transforms the spirit of the upper as well as of the lower classes. Not only that, but there is a prevailing tendency to consider this impression a sign of force, a proof of greatness and of progress. The history of Rome admonishes us, then, to distrust this illusion, and to sound the spirit of our civilisation to its deepest depths—that spirit which to us seems a limpid mirror of perfection, while it is really very much the96 opposite. If, after twenty centuries of work and study, we find ourselves, fortunate heirs of an ancient civilisation, in a position to live more safely and more comfortably than did our ancestors on this little globe, we are not, therefore, justified in altering the moral values and virtues to suit our pleasures. The vices, the faults, the depraved inclinations of twenty centuries ago remain the same to-day and modern civilisation would be guilty of the gravest of errors if, deaf to the great lesson preached by the ruins of Rome, she boasted of those very defects which destroyed in the ancient world one of the greatest works of human brain and energy that history has to offer.",
        "target_summary": "Rome reached its peak of expansion, splendor, and population in the mid-4th century, a time when its decadence was already significantly advanced. It was then, through its countless grand temples, magnificent baths, basilicas, private palaces, and beautiful public gardens, that Rome became the most marvelous and admired city of the Empire. This stood in stark contrast to its state in the 1st century, when the Empire was genuinely flourishing, with secure frontiers, a growing population, natural urban development, a healthy economy across agriculture, trade, and industry, and a strong, well-organized government.\n\nThe author explains that this is not a historical paradox but a universal truth: ostentation, grand display, and a passion for doing things on a colossal scale are signs of decadence, not progress, in families, nations, and civilizations. This unhealthy passion thrives in eras of deep-seated imbalance between desires and reality, fueled by a thirst for excitement, violent sensations, and a lavish expenditure of resources to create a false illusion of grandeur and power, often driven by intense, prideful rivalry.\n\nA primary cause of the excessive sumptuousness in ancient cities, evident in their festivals, ceremonies, and monuments, was this fierce rivalry among big, medium, and small cities, provinces, districts, classes, families, professions, sects, and religions. If one city built a theatre or baths, its sister-cities would immediately aim for something equally grand or grander. Wealthy families competed to endow the finest temples or baths, and religions vied for the most sumptuous ceremonial spaces. This explains structures like Verona's enormous amphitheater, capable of accommodating its entire population multiple times over. The immense wealth poured into such displays by all levels of society would have been far better spent on defending the Empire or preserving its economic resources. Indeed, many admired Roman ruins today represented the Empire's financial ruin when they were built.\n\nThe author then challenges contemporary society, asking if our current epoch is free from this \"mania for grandeur and display\" and \"sterile public and private rivalry\" that drained Rome's wealth and masked its decline. He asserts that we are not, pointing to the rapid growth of public and private luxury, the escalating vanity of nations and social groups, and a pervasive tendency to mistake colossal size for intrinsic virtue. This trend permeates politics, religion, literature, philosophy, and art, corrupting the spirit of all classes across America and Europe. Alarmingly, this pursuit of grandeur is often mistakenly seen as a sign of strength, greatness, and progress.\n\nRome's history serves as a critical warning, urging us to distrust this illusion and deeply scrutinize the true spirit of our own civilization. While our era might appear to be a \"limpid mirror of perfection,\" it is often quite the opposite. Despite two millennia of intellectual and practical advancements that offer us safer and more comfortable lives, we are not justified in altering fundamental moral values and virtues to suit our pleasures. The vices and faults of twenty centuries ago persist. Modern civilization would make a grave error if, ignoring the profound lesson from Rome's ruins, it were to boast of the very defects that destroyed one of history's greatest human achievements.",

        "content": "We are always talking about progress. But does “progress” mean only the multiplication of wealth and of the power and speed of machines, in other words, of our mastery over nature? This would be a rash assertion. “Progress” implies further improvement of, and increase in, the virtues, and the diminution of the vices inherent in human nature. Now, can anyone who knows the history of ancient civilisation, the life, the customs, the ideas, and the moral outlook of the Greeks and Romans, say that we have become better than they? And if he can say so, how much better have we become? Have we become better in every department of life, or are there some things in which we show a falling-off? There can be no doubt that we are braver than the ancients. Our control of fire has obliged us to be continually making calls upon our bravery. The formidable machines which we set in motion; the explosives which we use so largely; the murderous forces of nature, like electricity, which we have brought into subservience;98 the thousand dangerous exploits on the sea, in the bowels of the earth, and in the giddy heights of the air in which thousands, nay millions, of engineers and workmen daily risk their lives, have steeled our temperaments to quell that blind and instinctive fear which lies deep down in human nature. War is the supreme test of this increased courage. War has become rarer, it is true, than it was in the ancient world; but how much more terrible and awe-inspiring has it become, both by land and by sea, since fire replaced steel as the principal weapon! The only forms of fire known to the ancients as useful in war were boiling oil, which was often used in sieges, and the so-called Greek fire, which was employed in naval battles—a mysterious compound, into which one suspects, petroleum entered, for it was much used by the nations and cities of the Black Sea. But both of these were but children’s toys compared with the guns, shrapnel, and torpedoes of modern warfare. We are justified, therefore, in asserting that the men who took part in the battles of Marathon, Cannæ, and Zama did not need to have hearts so stout or courage so intrepid as the men who faced each other in the great battles of the Napoleonic era, in the American Civil War, in the battles between the Russians and Japanese, or in the recent Balkan War. But if we are more courageous, we are at the same time less cruel, a fact which throws our superior courage into greater relief. One of the characteristic differences99 between contemporary civilisation and those which preceded it, up to the French Revolution, is the total suppression of the bloody spectacles which, under so many aspects and forms, were one of the most sinister delights of our ancestors. We find the greatest difficulty in understanding how so highly civilised a people as the Romans, with so many thoughts and feelings in common with ourselves, could have been roused to such a pitch of intoxication by the games of gladiators and the baiting of wild beasts. And yet the popular passion for these bloody games was such that even the emperors, in whom they inspired feelings of horror and repulsion, like Augustus, were compelled to attend the gory spectacles, so as not to appear, by their absence, to rebuke those who supported them and to run counter to the absorbing passion of the masses for them. On the other hand, if an ancient Roman came back to the world, and saw an American stadium packed with people from top to bottom, he would be not a little puzzled to explain what could have induced so many thousands of persons to have flocked together from afar merely to watch a football match,—to collect in such crowds, endure such a long journey, and such discomfort, just to get a distant view of some youths kicking their legs in the air! It would seem to them a truly insipid and tiresome spectacle. Their tastes ran to a gory struggle, reminiscent of war, to fights between men and animals, blood in bucketfuls. Christianity initiated that education of men’s feelings100 which has made us gradually turn away our eyes in horror from these atrocious diversions. But how slow and difficult this education has been! It can safely be said not to have reached its climax until after the Revolution. Only the nineteenth century, intent on mitigating and humanising the penal law in every direction, has finally succeeded in abolishing the last of these cruel spectacles, capital punishment. Right up to the end of the eighteenth century, condemned prisoners were executed throughout Europe with much pomp and in the full light of day, in the central squares of the cities, at times and places at which everybody could attend, as if at a public festival. Indeed, executions were invariably attended by an immense public, attracted by cruel curiosity to see a man going to his death. By diminishing the number of death sentences, and by executing culprits in prison yards in the presence of a handful of witnesses, or, as is still done in France, in public, but at dawn, with the public kept at as great a distance as possible, the nineteenth century has put the crown on one of the most far-reaching and wonderful moral transformations of the human mind, a transformation which owes its birth to the words of Christ uttered twenty centuries ago, and has given modern civilisation one notable reason for boasting itself superior to the ancient. But if we are more courageous and more humane, we are, on the other hand, in no way more sober or more temperate. As far as these virtues are concerned, the101 ancient world cuts a much better figure in history than does the modern. We have deteriorated. The modern world eats and drinks to excess. It indulges to excess in alcoholic drinks and stimulants. The only intoxicating drinks known to the ancients were wine and beer, and wine they always drank mixed with water. They did not know alcohol, nor consequently, liqueurs, now so numerous and so highly appreciated; they did not know tea, coffee, or tobacco. We can assert positively that drunkenness was the rarest of vices in the ancient world, while frugality was the commonest of virtues. We need not take too seriously those orgies of the wealthy to which ancient writers—especially Latin writers—so often allude, or the banquets at which dishes of parrots’ tongues were served, or pearls dissolved in vinegar were drunk. These stories bear a strong family likeness to the legends current in Europe about “the corrupt state of American society,” and are due to the same tendency. They are the exaggerated and violent reaction of an ancient puritanism against the natural advances of luxury and against that kind of moral slackening which always accompanies the increase of wealth. Just as the dispassionate and unprejudiced European, when he examines at close-quarters the so-called “corrupt state of American society,” readily recognises that the high-sounding expression only indicates certain defects and weaknesses which certainly are reprehensible, but which are common to the whole of modern civilisation and not102 peculiar to America, so the famous Roman orgies and the banquets, which have made so much stir, would seem to us, if a miracle allowed us to attend them, very modest and unassuming affairs compared to our ostentatious displays.",
        "target_summary": "The author questions whether \"progress\" solely entails material and technological advancements or if it also signifies moral improvement, such as increased virtues and diminished vices. Comparing contemporary civilization to ancient Greeks and Romans, the text evaluates humanity's moral standing.\n\nFirstly, modern humans are demonstrably braver. The constant exposure to dangerous machines, explosives, harnessed natural forces, and perilous endeavors in daily life and industry has steeled temperaments. Modern warfare, though less frequent, is far more terrifying with its fire-based weapons than ancient conflicts, demanding significantly greater courage from soldiers.\n\nSecondly, contemporary society is considerably less cruel. The brutal public spectacles, like gladiator games and animal baiting, that captivated even highly civilized Romans, are now morally incomprehensible. This shift is attributed to a slow but profound moral education initiated by Christianity. This process culminated after the French Revolution, with the 19th century abolishing cruel penal laws and transforming public executions—once popular festivals—into private, discreet affairs. This represents a monumental moral advancement, highlighting modern civilization's superiority in humaneness.\n\nHowever, modern society shows a marked deterioration in sobriety and temperance. The ancient world, primarily knowing only wine (often mixed with water) and beer, was characterized by rare drunkenness and common frugality. In stark contrast, modern people indulge excessively in food, alcohol, and stimulants, having access to numerous intoxicating substances unknown to antiquity. Exaggerated historical accounts of ancient Roman orgies are dismissed as puritanical reactions to luxury, likely appearing modest compared to contemporary ostentatious displays.\n\nThus, while modern humans are more courageous and humane, they are less sober, presenting a complex picture of moral progress.",

        "content": "As far, then, as sobriety and temperance are concerned, we cannot confront our ancestors with too haughty a mien. And what shall we say about the purity of our customs? That is a much more difficult problem, perhaps an absolutely insoluble one. At least I, for my part, do not feel myself competent to solve it. To judge from Greco-Latin literature and art, one would say that in the ancient world, with the exception of a few countries and certain epochs, such as the centuries during which Rome was controlled by a puritan aristocracy, the customs of both men and women were very free and easy. But literature and art often afford untrustworthy evidence on which to base a judgment as to the customs of an epoch. For vice, wrong, and crime, though they may shock the moral sense, are more interesting subjects for art than are virtue and honesty. In short, literature and art always seek to describe what is rare, exceptional, and dramatic. Therefore, if we wish to judge the moral state of an epoch from its literature and art, we must know how far and in what degree the faults and vices described or chosen for artistic representation are common, what is the rule, and how many are the exceptions. And how are we to find this out? We shall have to103 know the moral state of the epoch, and literature will not help us to this knowledge. Anybody who judged Paris from the novels or dramas which deal with Parisian life would be forced to conclude that the French metropolis spends the whole of its time in amorous adventures. But anyone who knows Paris is aware, what is after all an a priori supposition, that love occupies in its life a very much less prominent place than in its literature; and that the writers of dramas and novels go to love for their subject by preference, because love admits of more attractive treatment than do struggles for money or the rivalries of political ambitions and the crosses of the intellectual life. For the rest, when we wish to judge the customs of an epoch or of a people, we must not forget that it is not always the epochs or the nations which lament most loudly the depravity of customs that are the most corrupt. Far from it! Often the epochs which bewail their own vices most bitterly are those in which the moral conscience is still lively and robust and, therefore, protests against the evil. The epochs which are dumb, and seem most virtuous, have often reached such a pitch of depravity, that they have become indifferent to the evil. A striking instance of this curious phenomenon is to be found in the history of Rome. Horrible stories are told of the first period of the Empire,—extending from Augustus to Nero,—during which the family of the Julio-Claudii were at the helm of the State. History and104 literature are full of scandals, and of laments over the depravity of the times. In the second period, on the other hand,—that of the Flavii and Antonines,—the scandals and protests cease. The depravity of the preceding century seems suddenly to have mysteriously disappeared. The Roman world has, by a kind of miraculous conversion, in a few years turned virtuous. In fact, not a few historians have thought that this miracle did come about, and have credited it to the virtuous emperors of the second century. After so many bad emperors, Rome at last got some good ones; and the trick was done! But anybody who studies the facts with a little patience will have no hesitation in concluding that the times of the Antonines were at least as corrupt as those of the Julio-Claudii; but that, while in the first century of the Christian era the ancient Puritan spirit of Rome was still alive and vigorous, and therefore protested against the deterioration of customs with such energy that its protests have reached even to our ears, in the epoch of the Antonines, on the other hand, this spirit was spent. Consequently, everybody resigned himself to the evil, either despairing of being able to cure it, or not giving it a thought. And so, of the two epochs, that which was painted in the blacker colours was, perhaps, really the better. It is impossible, then, to decide whether our customs are better or worse than those of the ancients. It is certain, on the other hand, that we are much more human than they. For with us, a sentiment, which with105 the ancients was very weak, if not non-existent, is lively and profound, the sentiment of the moral equality of every individual. The ancients simply refused to recognise in the slave and in the free man, in the nobleman and in the plebeian, in the citizen and in the foreigner, human creatures made of the same clay and animated by the same spirit, whom the mysterious accidents of fortune had placed in different situations, and all of whom had certain sacred and inviolable rights in the supreme domain of justice. A few philosophers dared just to hint at such doctrines, but without laying too much stress upon them. And theirs were voices crying in the wilderness. The free man, the patrician, and the citizen felt themselves creatures of another species and of a higher nature than slaves, plebeians, and foreigners, towards whom the former group might have capricious bursts of benevolence, but to whom they never regarded themselves as bound by any obligation. Hence came that asperity which appears in all the social relations of ancient peoples,—in their laws, their customs, their wars, their political quarrels,—and which often seems to us in so striking a contrast with the lofty and noble culture which adorned the ancient states. Augustus, for instance, was a grave, well-balanced, and prudent man, who avoided all extremes. Yet the ancient writers tell us to his credit that he had amongst his numerous freedmen several men of the loftiest intellect, of wide knowledge, and of transparent honesty, who had rendered him great services; but that, though106 he held them in great honour, he never invited any of them to his table. Such an act of familiarity between freedmen and patricians would have seemed to the ancients derogatory, and so they praised Augustus for having avoided it. To us, on the other hand, this attitude of reserve on the part of the great Emperor seems strange and incomprehensible, as it would seem on the part of a great and wealthy manufacturer who was ashamed to dine with the heads of departments of his business. On the other hand, the difference between rich and poor was much less marked in the ancient world than it is in the modern. This is, perhaps, the most striking and important of the lines of cleavage between the world of antiquity and that of to-day. The idea of the moral equality of men, who are all sons of God, which was disseminated by Christianity; the idea of political and social equality, which was promulgated by the French Revolution, have in modern civilisation cut at the roots of the ancient distinctions of class, of religion, and even to a certain extent of nationality. But modern society is organising itself, in compensation, into a hierarchy of wealth. Men may consider themselves in theory all equal to one another; but each tries to associate with those persons who have approximately the same means as he, because it is they who are able to have the same habits as he has. Precisely because the modern world is so rich and so luxurious, the modes of living among the richest, the rich, and the moderately107 well-to-do classes show striking differences. And what is true of the modes of living is also true of tastes and inclinations. Everybody realises nowadays that differences or resemblances in habits, tastes, and inclinations are what most attract and repel men and influence them in treating each other as equals or unequals, when custom and tradition have established no other moral difference between them. The motor-car is as powerful a barrier between the social classes of to-day as was aristocratic prejudice before the Revolution.",
        "target_summary": "The author posits that modern society can confidently claim superiority over ancient ancestors regarding sobriety and temperance. However, assessing the purity of customs presents a far more complex and perhaps insoluble problem. Greco-Latin literature and art suggest very \"free and easy\" ancient customs, but these sources are often unreliable. Art and literature tend to depict the rare, exceptional, and dramatic—like vice, wrong, and crime—because these subjects are more interesting than virtue and honesty. Therefore, to truly gauge an era's moral state from its art, one would need to know how common the depicted faults were compared to the prevailing norms, which literature itself cannot reveal. For instance, judging modern Paris solely by its novels would erroneously conclude its life revolves entirely around romance, when writers often choose love for its attractive treatment over other struggles.\n\nFurthermore, societies that loudly lament the depravity of their customs are not necessarily the most corrupt. Often, such bitter complaints indicate a still-lively and robust moral conscience protesting against evil. Conversely, epochs that are silent and appear virtuous may have reached such a pitch of depravity that they've become indifferent. Roman history exemplifies this: the first period of the Empire (Augustus to Nero) is replete with scandals and laments, reflecting an active ancient Puritan spirit vigorously protesting the deterioration of customs. The subsequent Flavian and Antonine eras, though appearing more virtuous due to a lack of protests, were likely just as corrupt, but with a spent moral conscience leading to widespread resignation or indifference to evil. Thus, the era painted in blacker colors might have been, morally, the better one.\n\nGiven these complexities, it's impossible to definitively conclude whether modern customs are better or worse than those of the ancients. However, modern society is undeniably more humane due to a profound and lively sentiment of the moral equality of every individual, a concept largely weak or non-existent in antiquity. Ancients typically refused to acknowledge the shared humanity of slaves and free men, nobles and plebeians, citizens and foreigners, seeing them as different species. While a few philosophers hinted at such ideas, their voices were largely unheard. This fundamental inequality fostered an asperity in all ancient social relations, laws, customs, and wars. A telling example is Augustus, a prudent man, who was praised for never inviting his highly intelligent and honest freedmen, who rendered him great service, to his table, an act of familiarity deemed derogatory by ancient standards. To modern sensibilities, such reserve seems strange and incomprehensible.\n\nConversely, the ancient world exhibited much less pronounced differences between rich and poor than today, representing perhaps the most significant cleavage between the two eras. While Christianity disseminated the idea of moral equality and the French Revolution championed political and social equality, modern civilization has, in compensation, organized itself into a hierarchy of wealth. Despite theoretical equality, people gravitate towards those with similar financial means, leading to striking differences in living modes, tastes, and inclinations across various economic classes. These economic distinctions and their resultant lifestyles now act as powerful social barriers, much like aristocratic prejudice before the Revolution, influencing how people treat each other as equals or unequals where tradition offers no other moral distinction.",

        "content": "In ancient times, on the other hand, precisely because the world was then so much poorer and simpler, the difference in the mode of living between poor and rich was much smaller. Both lived in closer contact, treating each other really as equals, provided always that they were of the same rank socially and politically. Augustus, who could not have freedmen, however enlightened, to dinner, invited poor, but free-born, plebeians. A rich Roman would never have entertained a freedman in his house or at his table, or treated him as an equal, even if the latter had been as rich as, or richer than, himself. On the other hand, he welcomed and treated as an equal a citizen free-born like himself, however miserable and reduced to living on his bounty. If, therefore, the ancient conception of the social relations was less humane and less generous than ours, it was not wanting in a certain moral grandeur that is wanting to ours, inasmuch as in estimating a man, it subordinated his wealth to ideal qualities, such as free108 birth, or good birth, or citizenship. So it maintained in society certain moral values which were not to be bought with money. The poorest of Roman citizens was conscious and proud of possessing something of inestimable value, which the richest and most opulent of Roman freedmen could not acquire for all his wealth; and this sentiment was a very real alleviation of, and compensation for, his poverty. Dare we assert that in this respect our social system does not fall short of the ancient one? Such an assertion would be, in my opinion, a very bold one. The gravest weakness in modern society consists precisely in this continual increase of the power of money, as an all-regulating force and universal standard. If the social evolution which we are witnessing continues on the path on which it has started, in a short time there will be nothing in life worth having which is not purchasable for money; and then what means will there be left of bridling the greed and envy of the poor? But this superiority of ancient society was in its turn the effect of a different conception of wealth, of its rights, its duties, and its objects. It is an exaggeration to credit the ancients with a simplicity and a contempt for riches, qualities which serve as a strange contrast with the greed and the insatiable thirst for gold which possess the moderns. In ancient times, it is true, men preached moderation in desires and taught the art of being contented with but little, with greater zeal and success than it is taught in modern times.109 Nevertheless, the men of those days, with but few exceptions, were not less greedy than we, and not less apt to consider wealth as the greatest of life’s blessings. Those who could, accumulated large private fortunes with the same frenzy and the same insatiate greed that inflame so many speculators and business men of the present day; and many of those who were content to live the simple life were converts to this noble and lofty philosophy from necessity rather than from conviction. The wealth of the ancient world was infinitely smaller than that of the modern world. Consequently a large number of persons had to be content to live the simple life. On this account the religions and the philosophers invented many theories and doctrines to prove that simplicity and parsimony were more desirable than opulence and luxury. That is the reason for the numberless theories regarding austerity that antiquity invented. But though the ancients desired riches as much as we do, they were not infatuated by the desire to multiply them to the same extent as the moderns. In this respect, the ancients may truly be said to have been more austere and disinterested than we. And the difference between their thoughts and feelings on the subject and our own is seen most strikingly in one fundamental principle, which is, as it were, the keystone of the whole fabric of ideas and sentiments which concern riches; I mean, the question of putting money out at interest. To modern society it seems the most110 natural thing in the world that money should earn interest. Nowadays, the number of those who lend or invest capital in the countless ways offered by modern finance is infinite. Every one of these big and little capitalists, who possess State bonds, shares in railways or industrials, or bank or commercial securities, would be thunderstruck if anyone told him that he was behaving in an unseemly way. Matters have reached a point at which the distinction between investment and usury is fading from our minds. And yet numberless generations, and not a few of the most brilliant civilisations in history, professed the idea that any business of that sort was unbecoming. The ancients as a rule, with but few casual exceptions, judged it unfitting for a man of the respectable classes to earn money in any other way than either from land and houses—realty—or from direct participation in commerce and the arts; never from money lent at interest to others. That was usury; and was considered nearly always, with but few exceptions of time and place, as the exercise of a degrading profession. Wealthy men, with large sums of money at their disposal, were able, and were expected, to help those who needed money; but with gratuitous, not with interest-bearing loans. The letters of Cicero, for instance, are full of references to these gratuitous loans, for which the great orator, when short of money, often asked his friends. When he was in funds, he lent to those who were in need. In short, the lending of money without interest to upright and honourable persons111 was considered in those days a duty of the rich. Of course, ideas like these about money and interest were bound to retard the development of the ancient world and the increase of wealth. But they were ideas which kept alive in men’s minds a certain noble disinterestedness of which it would be difficult to find traces to-day, and which makes amends for many of the asperities of ancient civilisation. Considering, then, the separate virtues one by one, we find that in some we have progressed, in others we have not. Therefore, in certain respects we are better than the ancients, in others we are worse. Must we conclude that the good and the evil balance each other, and that, therefore, there has been no real moral progress from the ancient world to the modern? That would be, in my opinion, a very bold assertion. It is, in fact, undeniable that our moral life is richer in principles than that of the ancients, because we have retained many of the ancient principles, and have added to them the moral principles which were invented by the civilisations which flourished after the fall of the Roman Empire. We appreciate the virtues of patriotism, civic affection, and valour in war which were proper to the ancient cities. To them we add the sense of legality and right, the need for precise and prompt justice, which were invented by the ancient jurists and perfected by the moderns. We add charity, mercy, love of our neighbour, horror of cruel amusements, virtues which Christ taught us. We add the sentiment of the112 dignity and the rights of man, which was created by the philosophy of the eighteenth century and by the French Revolution. We add certain other brand-new sentiments, the creation of the civilisation of machinery, which are, therefore, stronger in America than in Europe: ardour for the new, enthusiasm for progress, confidence in our own strength. In war, we fight like the Romans, and in peace, we turn our eyes away from bloody spectacles. We should hold the gladiatorial games in no whit less horror than the most pious of Christian monks. We trade like the Phœnicians and we love knowledge like the Greeks. We appreciate liberty and we appreciate authority. Does not all this constitute real progress? And does it not suffice to counterbalance certain other defects of ours, such as intemperance and the immoderate desire for riches? I think so. But that does not mean that we are at liberty to abandon ourselves freely to our vices and defects, under the pretext that they are compensated for by other virtues. It is the duty of every civilisation, as of every man, to make himself as perfect as possible. And this duty we must not forget, not even in the midst of the immeasurable triumphs of the richest, most powerful, and wisest civilisation that has ever yet seen the light of day.",
        "target_summary": "The excerpt contrasts ancient and modern societal values, particularly regarding wealth and social status. In ancient times, the lifestyle gap between rich and poor was narrower, and social equality hinged on ideal qualities like free birth or citizenship, not money. A wealthy Roman, for instance, would welcome a poor free-born citizen as an equal, but not a rich freedman. This prioritization of non-monetary values instilled pride in even the poorest citizens. The author argues that modern society's increasing emphasis on money as an all-encompassing standard is a critical flaw, potentially leading to a future where everything desirable is purchasable.\n\nAlthough ancients desired wealth similar to moderns, often advocating moderation out of necessity, their method of accumulation differed significantly. Lending money at interest (usury) was generally viewed as a degrading practice; wealthy individuals were expected to offer gratuitous loans to those in need, fostering a certain noble disinterestedness, albeit one that may have retarded economic development.\n\nAssessing overall moral progress, the author contends that modern society has advanced. While retaining ancient virtues like patriotism and valor, we have incorporated new moral principles from post-Roman civilizations, including legality, justice, charity, mercy, the dignity and rights of man, and enthusiasm for progress. These advancements, demonstrated by our revulsion towards cruel spectacles like gladiatorial games and our synthesis of commerce with knowledge, signify real moral progress despite modern shortcomings such as intemperance and an immoderate desire for riches. However, this progress does not absolve society of its duty to constantly strive for greater perfection.",

        "content": "The two visits I paid to South and North America between 1907 and 1909 were the result of a lucky chance, not of a prearranged plan. In 1906, after having been plunged for ten years in the study of Roman history, I had no idea of crossing the Atlantic, much less of writing a book on America and Europe. I had never dreamt that my long researches in the great cemetery of the ancient world might start me suddenly one day along the road which leads to the New World. But destiny willed it so. In November of 1906, by invitation of the Collège de France, I delivered in Paris a course of lectures on the history of Augustus, in which I summarised the fourth and fifth volumes of my Greatness and Decline of Rome. There happened to be at Paris at that time a distinguished Argentine, Señor Emilio Mitré, son of that General Mitré who was one of the Republic’s most conspicuous politicians during the second half of the nineteenth century. He himself was a man of importance in the political world, and proprietor of the Nacion, which is not only the biggest,116 most serious, and most authoritative newspaper in Latin America, but one of the leading newspapers of the world. I had contributed to this paper for years, so I called on Mitré in Paris. He came to hear my lectures, and the day before the concluding one, November 29th,—he was due to sail for Buenos Aires on December 1st,—he came to me with a proposal that I should go to Argentina and there deliver some lectures. I accepted, impelled chiefly by curiosity to see that vast and rich country which, for the last ten years, had been so much talked about in Italy, and to which during the last half-century so many Italians had emigrated. I accordingly prepared my lectures, and on June 7, 1907, I sailed from Genoa for Buenos Aires with my wife and little boy. Every European who crosses the Atlantic and can wield his pen with any sort of effect writes his impressions when he gets back. Naturally, therefore, I too had promised several reviews and one publisher to bring back with me a volume of “Impressions of Argentina.” At six P.M. on June 8th, we put in to Barcelona. Directly the steamer came alongside, the Brazilian consul came on board in search of me. He handed me a despatch from Baron di Rio Branco, the Brazilian Minister of Foreign affairs, who invited me in the name of the Brazilian Academy to stop at Rio, and read a paper there. I begged the consul to telegraph to Baron di Rio Branco that I could not stop on my voyage out, as I was expected at Buenos Aires; but that on my return I should be delighted to accept his kind invitation.117 As the steamer was to put in at Rio, I could arrange matters with him en route. As the steamer resumed her journey, and passed out of the Mediterranean into the vast wilderness of the ocean, I busied myself with some books of philosophy which I had brought along, amongst them, some of Buddha’s discourses, which had just been published in an Italian translation. On June 24th, at 5 P.M., we reached the bay of Rio, one of the most marvellous spots in the world. But while we were gazing from the deck in admiration at the gloomy mountains standing round about and the woods which covered them, at the city rising from the sea towards the mountains, and the roseate glow of the setting sun upon the bay, we descried a steam launch laden with people coming towards us. It was a deputation from the Brazilian Academy and from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was coming to take us for a motor tour through the city, and afterwards to take us to dinner at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where Baron di Rio Branco was expecting us. We hastened ashore, and found some motors waiting for us at the Pharoux jetty. We jumped in, and were off. As long as life lasts, I shall never forget that drive at sunset, between the dying light of evening and the first gleams of the electric lamps, which were just beginning to light up the marvellous city built in the midst of the remains of the primeval forest on the borders of the sea, on the hills, and on the mountains.118 I shall never forget our dash through endless streets, with hurried glimpses of multi-coloured houses, sumptuous palaces half hidden in superb gardens, avenues of gigantic palms which stretched far away into the night, glorious promenades along the seashore, and mountain peaks which beetled above the city. I longed to stop the car. But time pressed, and after having hurriedly traversed the whole city, we reached, about 7.30 P.M., Itamaraty (as the palace of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is called), where a select company of men and women were awaiting us in rooms ablaze with light. As soon as we had been introduced, dinner was served; a most sumptuous dinner, into which, among the most luscious ragoûts of the French cuisine, the thoughtful Minister of Foreign Affairs had introduced several Brazilian dishes. I remember the palmiti, a dish of palm-pith, cooked as we cook asparagus, and really delicious; and bakury, a white fruit from the equator, preserved in syrup, which reminded me strongly of the smell of magnolia and gave me the illusion of eating marvellous flowers. Speeches followed the dinner, whereupon we returned on shipboard, but before doing so I had arranged in a corner of the drawing-room with Baron di Rio Branco, Giuseppe Graça Aranha, now Brazilian Minister at the Hague, and a distinguished writer, who was then the Minister’s secretary, and Machado de Assis, the great writer who was then President of the Brazilian Academy, that I would stop a couple of months in119 Brazil on my way back, repeat my Buenos Aires lectures, and visit the country. At 11 P.M., the steamer weighed anchor and left the dark bay, in which there was nothing now to be seen but the glitter of an infinite number of tiny lights. That night, however, I did not sleep, so stunned and dazzled was I by that first fantastic glimpse of America, which will remain one of the most singular experiences of my life, though, so far, my life has not been devoid of strange and curious chances. I had started from Europe with no, or practically no, knowledge of the two Americas, excepting the little I had picked up here and there in books and papers which I happened to read. Consequently, my opinion of America was the same as that formed by other Europeans: that it was the country of material realities, of business, of fortunes made rapidly, of wealth stripped of every ornament, poetry, beauty, and ideal refinement; that rude and bustling America with which all cultured Europeans love to contrast Europe as the continent of the Ideal, where beauty, wisdom, and every refinement of civil life flourish. And behold! my first impression of America was as of a strip of India, and the first American city I had seen reminded me of the East, and especially, for some reason or other, of Bagdad, or rather, of the somewhat fantastic idea of Bagdad which I had conceived in the days when I read more often and more ardently than I do now, the Orientales of Victor Hugo, and the other romantic poets of the middle of the120 nineteenth century. And in that city, I had been present at a succulent and magnificent banquet, at which, amidst the refinements of the old civilisation of Europe, I had tasted the unknown rarities of the tropics, in the company of elegant, cultured, and refined guests, with whom I had discussed in French the latest literary and artistic novelties, as if we had been on the banks of the Seine. Was it a reality or a dream?",

For a decade prior, he had focused solely on Roman history, never contemplating a journey to the New World, which he contrasted with the ancient world's \"great cemetery.\"\n\nHis unexpected path began in November 1906, while lecturing in Paris on Augustus. There, he met Señor Emilio Mitré, a distinguished Argentine politician and proprietor of *La Nación*, a prominent Latin American newspaper to which the author was a contributor. Mitré invited the author to deliver lectures in Argentina. The author accepted, motivated primarily by curiosity about the \"vast and rich country\" that was then much discussed in Italy and a destination for many Italian emigrants.\n\nOn June 7, 1907, he sailed from Genoa with his family, having promised reviews and a publisher a volume of \"Impressions of Argentina.\" The next day, during a stop in Barcelona, the Brazilian consul presented an invitation from Baron di Rio Branco, Brazil's Minister of Foreign Affairs, for the author to lecture in Rio. Committed to Buenos Aires first, the author politely declined for his outbound journey but agreed to visit, lecture, and tour Brazil for a couple of months on his return trip, planning to finalize details in Rio.\n\nThe ship reached Rio de Janeiro's \"marvellous\" bay on June 24th. A deputation from the Brazilian Academy and Foreign Ministry immediately met them, taking them on an unforgettable sunset motor tour of the city. He vividly described the \"marvellous city built in the midst of the remains of the primeval forest,\" with \"multi-coloured houses, sumptuous palaces... avenues of gigantic palms,\" and \"mountain peaks which beetled above the city.\" The tour concluded with a sumptuous dinner at Itamaraty, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs palace, hosted by Baron di Rio Branco. The meal offered a blend of refined French cuisine and exotic Brazilian dishes, such as palmiti and bakury, enjoyed in the company of elegant, cultured guests discussing the latest European literary and artistic novelties in French. Before re-boarding his ship, arrangements were finalized with Baron di Rio Branco, Giuseppe Graça Aranha, and Machado de Assis for his extended return visit to Brazil.\n\nDeparting Rio at 11 P.M., the author was left \"stunned and dazzled.\" His ingrained European view of America as merely a land of \"material realities,\" business, and wealth, devoid of beauty or ideal refinement, was utterly challenged. His first impression of Rio evoked the \"East,\" specifically a romanticized \"Bagdad,\" combining the refinements of old European civilization with tropical rarities among cultured company.

        "content": "Quite other surprises were, however, in store for me on my wanderings in America. Four days later, on June 27th, we reached Buenos Aires, where we were joyfully welcomed by a number of kind folk, who had spared neither trouble nor care to make our stay agreeable to us. Then began four months of really strenuous life, to borrow Theodore Roosevelt’s favourite expression. Conferences, receptions, banquets, visits to hospitals, schools, factories, workshops, and ranches; trips by boat, train, and motor-car. It was a real moto perpetuo. I passed the month of July at Buenos Aires. In August, I plunged into the interior, visiting successively Rosario, Mendoza, Cordova, Tucuman, Santiago, dell ’Estero, Santa Fé, Paraná, and penetrating right up to the foot of the Andes. I travelled about ten thousand kilometres in the railway train, observing, collecting documents, asking and answering questions, and discussing problems. All these, however, were labours less tiring than another, which became by degrees the principal preoccupation of my mind during those two months: the endeavour to put to flight a121 demon which kept obstinately springing up before my eyes, in conversations, on journeys, during visits, during dinner-parties, notwithstanding all the efforts I made to keep it at a distance; and which seemed determined to reappear at every moment and wound me in the inmost recesses of my European pride and in my most touchy European susceptibilities. What was this demon? It was American progress. Every day I had pointed out to me on my rapid journeys, immense and marvellous ranches, herds of many thousand head, markets overflowing with wealth, magnificent schools, and superb hospitals. I was given descriptions and demonstrations, in figures and in fact, of the rapid spread of cultivation, the increase of production, the bewildering prosperity of the banks, the expansion of Buenos Aires, now become the second city of the Latin world in wealth and population, after Paris. They were all interesting things to observe and study. Nevertheless, too many of those who showed them to me implicitly or explicitly established comparisons between this rapid increase and transformation in everything Argentine, and the more deliberate advance of the great nations of Europe, and deduced the conclusion that Argentina was a more progressive and advanced country. The word “progress” is one of those which is much misused in Europe. I had no sooner landed in Argentina, however, than I recognised that the word had quite a different sound and significance on that side122 of the water from what it has in Europe. The standard by which my new transatlantic friends were unanimous in measuring progress was the rapidity of transformation and the magnitude of the results. New, modern, larger, were to them synonyms of progress and of improvement. Consequently, they had only to cast their eyes round their own country to find reasons for self-satisfaction. But this conception of progress at first somewhat amused and somewhat irritated me, just as the naïve touches of vanity in the young often amuse and irritate grown men. Many a time, when we were discussing the progress of Argentina and the comparisons, tacit or explicit, which were made with Europe, have I said to my Argentine friends: “Undoubtedly the effort which you are making is a noble one, and a paying one. In thirty years, you have increased your wealth ten-, twenty-, even thirty-fold. You have been wonderfully quick in extending cultivation, railways, and population over the vast territory which Fortune has given you. You are now flooding the world with riches, and, profiting by the experience of others, you can transform, reshape, and make perfect your public services, your institutions, and your whole mode of living in the smallest number of years. “You make a great mistake, however, if you think that the contrast between the rapidity of your growth and your changes and the slowness and immutability of Europe is any proof of your own nearer approach to perfection. That rapidity is a phenomenon of youth.123 A child’s weight and height double themselves every six months, year, two years, or three years in the first years of its life; while an adult stops growing or grows so slowly as to be hardly aware that he is doing so. Would you deduce from this that a boy of six years of age is superior to a man of forty? No. Childhood and manhood are two phases of life. Each has its own necessity, its own function, its own advantages and disadvantages. It is no more possible to compare them than it is to compare day and night, dawn and twilight, winter and summer; I can see no essential difference between the countries of Europe and your own. We are all children of the same civilisation; we have been nursed at the same breast. We are all like one to the other, though we may differ one from the other as brothers, or, if you prefer it, as cousins do. So an American progress, different from European progress, does not exist, though there are countries whose transformation, owing to external circumstances, may be retarded or accelerated. You have political institutions and social orders of less antiquity, and, therefore, of less rigidity and less strength than those of Europe. You also have a territory to exploit which is vaster, very much vaster, and much more easy to exploit, because civilisation supplies you, ready to hand, with almost perfect instruments for such exploitation. There you have the real difference between us.” Though these arguments were listened to with courteous attention, they made but a slight impression124 on my hearers. I very soon realised that American progress, the rapid increase, that is to say, of the wealth of Argentina and the incessant modernisation of the customs and institutions of the country, were a sort of national religion, which was accepted by most people with a blind credence. So in the end, I was persuaded that this ardent faith in progress must be attributed to the preponderating influence of Buenos Aires, that immense city, almost half the population of which is composed of European immigrants in search of wealth. For it is the largest port, the principal emporium, and the financial centre of the Republic, through which passes most of the export and import trade, nearly all the great stream of wealth which flows out from the vast territory over the world, and from the world ebbs back to it again: a rich American city, after the European picture of such. It is only natural that a city whose wealth and size are being multiplied by the rapid development of the country should have adopted American progress as its religion, and should, through its influence, have imposed that religion on the whole country. The conclusion of the matter was, however, that the Argentine conception of progress was not and could not be anything but the passing exaltation of a fortunate country which, profiting by circumstances unusually favourable, could watch its wealth growing round it with bewildering rapidity. That, at any rate, was the conclusion I came to, and I thought it both reasonable and justifiable. 125 With this idea in my head, after a laborious, agreeable, and instructive stay of two months in Argentina, I sailed for Rio, making on my way thither a brief halt at Montevideo. I expected to find in Rio another American city like Buenos Aires. I was, however, mistaken. Brazil is not, like Argentina, a single body with one enormous head. Its economic activity is more diffuse and centres in different cities,—for coffee, in São Paulo; for rubber, in Manaos; for each one of the other great articles of production, in other cities scattered over the vast territory. Rio de Janeiro, though the chief political and intellectual centre of the Confederation, cannot, therefore, be called either the emporium or the port, or the economic capital par excellence. Consequently, it differs widely from Buenos Aires. It is less crowded, noisy, and busy. It lives, I might almost say, in the shade of its gardens and between the forest and the sea, quietly and reposedly. It is the only great American city I have visited in which people walk at a leisurely pace and not at headlong speed; and it not only lives reposedly, but it thinks, and even dreams a little.",
        "target_summary": "The author describes his arrival in Buenos Aires, followed by a strenuous four months of extensive travel across Argentina, covering 10,000 kilometers and observing its rapid development. During this time, his primary preoccupation became the \"demon\" of American progress, which constantly challenged his European pride.\n\nHe witnessed immense ranches, abundant markets, and impressive infrastructure like schools and hospitals, alongside figures detailing rapid cultivation, increased production, and Buenos Aires's growth into the second-largest Latin city. His Argentine hosts frequently highlighted this swift transformation, comparing it to Europe's more deliberate pace and equating \"new, modern, larger\" with progress and superiority.\n\nThe author found this perspective both amusing and irritating. While acknowledging Argentina's commendable efforts and rapid material growth in wealth, cultivation, railways, and population, he argued that this speed was a \"phenomenon of youth,\" analogous to a child's rapid development versus an adult's slower growth, without implying one was superior. He emphasized that both Europe and Argentina stemmed from the same civilization, with Argentina's rapid progress stemming from less ancient, more flexible institutions and a vast, easily exploitable territory, allowing it to apply existing European tools for swift development.\n\nHis arguments, though courteously received, made little impression. He concluded that \"American progress\"—the rapid increase in wealth and modernization—was a national religion in Argentina, accepted with blind faith. This fervent belief, he surmised, was largely fueled by Buenos Aires, a booming port city and financial hub attracting European immigrants seeking fortune, whose own rapid growth projected this identity onto the entire nation. He viewed it as a \"passing exaltation\" of a country fortunate enough to profit from unique circumstances.\n\nAfter his stay, the author sailed for Rio, expecting a city similar to Buenos Aires, but found he was mistaken. Brazil's economic activity was decentralized, unlike Argentina's single-headed model, with Rio serving mainly as the political and intellectual center. Consequently, Rio was less crowded, noisy, and bustling, appearing to live more quietly amidst its natural surroundings, where people moved at a leisurely pace and seemed to \"think, and even dream a little.\"",

        "content": "While at Buenos Aires, we had lived surrounded by men of action; we found at Rio a coterie composed almost exclusively of intellectuals—literary men, journalists, historians, philosophers, and jurists. Most of them were state officials and members of the Brazilian Academy,—an academy founded about ten years ago and modelled exactly on the lines of the Académie126 Française,—composed, like it, of forty members, elected in the same way, and admitted with the same ceremonial. In a small inn situated on the slopes of Corcovado, on the outskirts of the town and the forest, whose roads were shaded by secular trees, we lived for six weeks, just as Plato and his friends lived in the gardens of the Academy; discussing art, literature, philosophy, right, and morality with the friends whom Graça Aranha, the diplomatist and man of letters chosen by Baron di Rio Branco to do us the honours of Brazil, gathered round us almost daily. At no moment of my life have I felt myself so much detached from, and so superior to, the accustomed preoccupations which form the groundwork of ordinary existence in the modern world. And when I found myself living amongst persons for whom the culture of Europe represented the supreme blessing of life, the greatest pride of civilisation, for a moment I believed myself freed from that demon of American progress which had dogged me in Argentina. It was an illusion, however, which did not last long. Brazil is a country slightly older than Argentina. Owing to this reason, to its much greater size, to the variety of its climates and lands, which make it impossible to concentrate in a single city the direction of the whole of national life, and to other contingent reasons which it would take too long to enumerate here, Brazil has not developed in the last twenty years so rapidly as has Argentina. It has, however, developed127 much more quickly than any European country. I speedily saw that the rapidity of this progress was the great national pride of the Brazilians, even of those men of letters, philosophers, and writers, who professed to be such devoted disciples and admirers of Europe. In the same way the great national preoccupation was the acceleration, as far as possible, of the progress and increase of riches, and the exploiting and modernisation of the country, so that Brazil might not appear inferior in this particular to the other great states of America. An energetic administration had just finished the resanitation of Rio de Janeiro, destroying, at the cost of vast public works, all the breeding-places of yellow fever which up till then had infested it. The administration was then renovating it from top to bottom, opening streets and squares in the middle of the old quarters, constructing spacious promenades and gardens, and sumptuous public edifices, in a word, giving air and light and splendour and beauty to a city which was already beautiful in addition to being placed in a unique situation. I think there must be very few cities which in a few years have managed to destroy and rebuild, according to new plans, so large a part of themselves. Naturally the work has cost millions; but on the few occasions on which I timidly dared to make a remark to this effect, I received the laughing answer: “We are optimists; and we believe in progress!” This ædilitian transformation of Rio de Janeiro filled with pride all Brazilians, including my lettered and128 philosophical friends, on account of its rapidity and grandeur; and their pride was swelled by the thought that no European states, but perhaps the United States of North America alone, their great elder brother, could have done so much. Everybody thought, moreover, that the whole of Brazil ought to be modernised just like Rio, from top to bottom. I visited São Paulo, the great coffee-producing state. I traversed from end to end Minas Gerães, the great agricultural and mineral state which, as a symbol, as it were, of its intention to modernise itself entirely, has recently constructed a smiling and graceful new capitol, Bello Horizonte, in a most picturesque position crowning the hoary Ouro Preto. Everywhere I found politicians, officials, professors, literary men, commercial men, bankers, Brazilian and European immigrants, united in the same thought: that railways must be built, machinery bought, able engineers engaged, mines explored, cultivation extended, and industries founded to increase the country’s rate of progress by modernising it entirely. It was useless for me to try to prove even to those of my Rio acquaintances who were endowed with the highest and finest intellectual culture, that this conception of progress was too simple and material; that real progress is not to make new or to make quickly, but to make better; that it is not enough to augment wealth, but that it is necessary also to put it to good use, a more difficult problem than129 the producing of it. I tried to convince my friends that if so simple and material a notion of progress acquired a strong hold on the popular mind, the public would infallibly be impelled to create, not a lofty and noble civilisation, but a sort of opulent barbarism. In Brazil, as much as in Argentina, my arguments beat harmlessly against a faith and a passion which demands no proofs. “American Progress” for the Brazilians too was the great historical force of the future, which is going to create the new world, and the new civilisation whose dim foreshadowing seems to be agitating the masses at the present time. We returned to Italy in November. I recrossed the ocean from Rio de Janeiro to Genoa in fifteen days, during which I reread my books of philosophy. But the pages of Bergson, Kant, and Comte, which I read in mid-ocean, no longer riveted my attention as they had on the way out. For in the time for thought afforded me by the crossing, far from the world and its troubles, I plunged day by day in a more intense meditation on American progress, which, of all the things and phenomena I had witnessed, was that which had left on me the liveliest impressions. It was clear that it was not a theoretical idea, but a passion, a faith, a religion fervently embraced by nearly everybody. All the arguments which I had advanced to subject it to criticism had been fruitless; and not only ignorant men, and those eager to make money, but the most highly cultivated minds, the very intellectual élite of America,130 were blind to the contradictions and logical shortcomings of this conception. Nevertheless, was not this but an additional reason for studying this phenomenon thoroughly? It is not ideas which move and transform the world, but passions; and a passion, even if it be absurd, is a thousand times more powerful than a wise idea. Now it was not difficult to see what would happen if this religion of American progress spread through the world. Europe would lose, so to speak, her rights of historical primogeniture, and all her ancient civilisation would lose a great part of its value. If the rapid increase of riches is the supreme measure of civilisation, and if, in consequence, the efforts of a people must be concentrated on everything which can accelerate this increase, it is clear that the most ancient, populous, and glorious countries of Europe will not be able to keep pace with the young countries and with the nations which are masters of vast territories; and that, bit by bit, the most glorious civilisations of Europe will come to be regarded by the eyes of the rising generations as relics and fossils of another age. This danger no longer appeared to me so distant and hypothetical as to many other Europeans. After what I had seen in America, many facts and thoughts and tendencies to which I had hitherto paid scarcely any attention in Europe, seemed to me to acquire a new significance. I saw everywhere, even in the ancient world, traces and proofs of the rapid spread of the American idea of131 progress, especially among the nations like Germany, which have developed industry to a great, perhaps a too great, extent; and in all the countries, classes, and professions which have identified their interests most completely with those of industry. So the enemy who threatened the destruction of the ancient civilisation of Europe had already invaded the Old World.",
        "target_summary": "In Rio de Janeiro, the author initially found intellectual refuge among Brazilian literati, journalists, historians, philosophers, and jurists—many of whom were state officials and members of the Brazilian Academy, a body mirroring the Académie Française. For six weeks, in a tranquil inn on Corcovado, he daily discussed art, literature, and morality with friends gathered by diplomat Graça Aranha. This environment, celebrating European culture, made him feel momentarily free from the \"demon of American progress\" he'd encountered in Argentina.\n\nHowever, this illusion quickly dissolved. While Brazil, owing to its age, size, and diversity, hadn't developed as rapidly as Argentina in two decades, its progress significantly outpaced any European country. This \"rapidity of progress\" was a profound source of national pride, even for the Europe-admiring intellectuals. The national preoccupation was to accelerate progress, increase wealth, and modernize the country to avoid appearing inferior to other American states.\n\nRio de Janeiro's transformation exemplified this drive. The administration had eradicated yellow fever and was thoroughly renovating the city—opening new streets and squares, constructing grand promenades, gardens, and opulent public buildings, infusing \"air and light and splendour and beauty.\" This rapid, costly, and extensive rebuilding was met with an optimistic, \"We are optimists; and we believe in progress!\" Brazilians, including the author's philosophical friends, took immense pride in this transformation, believing only the United States could achieve such feats.\n\nThis modernization ethos was pervasive. Across São Paulo's coffee regions and Minas Gerais's agricultural and mineral lands (symbolized by its new capital, Bello Horizonte), the author observed a universal consensus among politicians, academics, and business leaders: the imperative was to build railways, acquire machinery, hire engineers, explore mines, expand cultivation, and establish industries to accelerate national progress through complete modernization.\n\nThe author unsuccessfully tried to persuade his cultured Rio acquaintances that this conception of progress was \"too simple and material.\" He argued that true progress meant \"making better,\" not just quickly, and that responsible wealth utilization was a more critical and difficult task than mere accumulation. He warned that such a simplistic notion could lead to \"opulent barbarism\" rather than a noble civilization. However, his arguments were futile, dismissed by an unyielding \"faith and passion\" in \"American Progress\" as the future's historical force, destined to create a new world.\n\nReturning to Italy, his philosophical books no longer captivated him. Instead, he intensely meditated on \"American progress,\" which he now understood as not a theoretical idea, but a powerful, irrational \"passion, a faith, a religion\" fervently embraced by nearly everyone. His logical criticisms had failed because even America's intellectual elite were \"blind to the contradictions and logical shortcomings.\"\n\nHe concluded that passions, not ideas, truly transform the world. If this \"religion of American progress\" spread globally, Europe's ancient civilization would be devalued. If rapid wealth accumulation became the ultimate measure of civilization, older, populous European countries could not compete with younger nations controlling vast territories, risking their glorious civilizations being viewed as \"relics and fossils.\" This danger, he now perceived, was not distant, as he saw \"traces and proofs\" of this American idea of progress already spreading in Europe, particularly in highly industrialized nations like Germany, and among classes whose interests aligned with industry, signifying the \"enemy\" had already invaded the Old World.",

        "title": "THE AMERICAN DEFINITION OF PROGRESS",
        "content": "It was while I was meditating on these thoughts in mid-ocean that the idea occurred to me of writing something different from a book of impressions on Argentina and Brazil. Too many books of impressions of the two Americas are written in Europe; and literature of this sort, as copious as it is useless, has justly satiated the public. Inasmuch as this idea of progress implies a great conflict of tendencies, from which may arise a profound upheaval of our civilisation, why should I not contrast in a book the two conceptions of progress, that which America has created and is trying to impose on the world, and that which is even now professed in Europe by the classes most faithful to tradition, and which they ought to seek to defend? If I succeeded in giving a vivid representation of this conflict, should I not have described a living part of America better than if I had merely accumulated thousands of detached impressions and observations? And so the idea flashed across my mind of writing a dialogue introducing some Europeans and Americans who on board a steamer in mid-ocean discussed Europe and America, that is to say, progress, in the sense132 proper to the word as well as in the sense given to it by the Americans. Is not the dialogue an ancient and glorious literary form? It is true that for many reasons it has lately been neglected, one particular reason being, that in modern life, busy and exhausting as it is, it is difficult to find a scene which will give verisimilitude to a conversation lasting several days. Modern civilisation is a civilisation of much action and little discussion. However, there is still one scene left in modern life on which one can stage with artistic verisimilitude a discussion lasting several days: a transatlantic liner. A liner is perhaps the only spot in the modern world where one may find discussion holding the field. Usually discussions on board ship deal with frivolous and empty topics. Why might not a writer suppose, however, that for once in a way, four or five serious-minded persons met on board a liner and began a casual talk which later developed into a discussion of one of the gravest of the problems which oppress our own generation, no less than every one of its predecessors? Among the persons whose acquaintance I had made during the voyage, some appeared to me to lend themselves to the rôle of interlocutor in the dialogue. So, directly I got back, I began to sketch out my dialogue. It was then that I experienced a curious phenomenon. With every fresh attempt I made to embody in certain characteristic personages the American idea of progress, as I had observed it in so many of my friends on that133 side, and the European idea, as I had many times defended it, both ideas seemed to me to evaporate, and to lose consistency and colour. That conflict of tendencies, ideas, and passions which had seemed to me so lively and so profound in my meditations in mid-ocean appeared to have melted away after I had touched the soil of old Europe. The dialogue which I was writing seemed to me cold, dead, and academic. I was torn in two directions by these difficulties, uncertain whether to abandon the enterprise, and asking myself whether American progress had not been a passing hallucination of the voyage; when towards the middle of February, 1908, I received from North America a new surprise of a still greater and more agreeable nature, in the shape of a letter from Baron Eduardo Mayor de Planches, at that time Italian Ambassador at Washington, in which he told me that President Roosevelt at his last diplomatic reception had expressed to him his wish to see me in the United States, and to have me as his guest for a few days at the White House before his presidential term ended. At any time, so courteous an invitation from a man for whose culture, intellect, and statesmanlike qualities I had so great an admiration, would have given me much pleasure. My joy was much increased, however, by the fact of its having arrived two months after my return from South America. A visit to the United States directly after one to South America was a rare stroke of luck. For, to tell the truth, in visiting Brazil134 and Argentina, I had seen only a fragment of the New World. But to come to know that great New-World State which by itself personifies America in the eyes of all, and to come to know the two largest states of South America into the bargain, was equivalent to saying that I had studied at least what was most important, characteristic, and deserving of study in the boundless continent which Columbus discovered. All the curiosity to which the rumours and legends current in Europe about the United States had given birth in me, and which was dominant in the recesses of my mind, awoke to life. I forgot the problem of progress, the doubts which tormented me, and the problems which I had posed to myself on my travels in Argentina, as well as the dialogue I intended to write, in my preparation for my fresh journey and for the lectures in Roman history which I was scheduled to give at the Lowell Institute, at Columbia University, and at the University of Chicago. I set to work to read as many books as I could about North America. I resumed the mantle of Roman historian to prepare my course of lectures and gave no further thought to the book on America which I had promised to write. On November 1, 1908, I sailed for New York, and a three months’ course of the intense life began again for me; rapid journeys, incessant visits, interviews with journalists, hundreds of conversations, banquets, receptions, speeches, and inquiries. I visited schools, hospitals, universities, prisons, law-courts, factories, banks,135 and co-operative enterprises. I made the acquaintance of millionaires and artisans, industrialists and professors, lawyers and journalists. I managed to get a peep into the wealthy abodes of the rich families of the great cities of the East, and into the little houses in which the middle classes drag out a crowded and pinched existence. I witnessed the frenzy for work, the incessant activity, the unending agitation which wears out every class in America. Most important of all, however, I saw reappear before me—and this time in gigantic form, monstrous, unrestrained, almost sublime in its savage energy—that demon of American progress which had impressed me so much in Brazil and Argentina, comparatively small though it had there appeared to me, and which in Europe seemed to me to have almost melted away. Was it not this which imbued everything American with that startling air of novelty, extravagance, and grandeur, which stunned and almost frightened me? So I devoted myself not only to the accumulation of impressions, informations, and recollections in profusion; I also set to work in the tumult of American life to think again about American progress. I made an effort to dive deeper down into the nature of this strange phenomenon, to guard against its melting away from before me when I got back to Europe. And at last, one day, I really thought I had found the clue. My wife and I had been invited to luncheon with a cultured and clever author, who knew three languages,136 had received an extensive and liberal education, and lived by her pen, writing for newspapers, translating, and giving lessons. She belonged, in fact, to what one might call the intellectual middle class. She lived with a sister in a street of old New York, occupying a little flat of the kind in which many middle-class New Yorkers live. One reached it by a little wooden staircase, and entered it by a little door, opening on to a little corridor, which gave access to four tiny rooms, whose floors creaked under foot and whose walls let the voices and noises of the neighbours and co-lodgers be clearly heard. Outside the windows and extending to the court-yard, the fire-escapes reminded one that the house, partly constructed of wood, might at any moment catch fire like a match. Naturally there were no servants in the house. With her sister’s help the charming author, when she returned home, laid down the pen and became cook and chambermaid. The luncheon, considered from an artistic point of view, gave us clearly to understand, that the hands which had prepared it did not possess any very considerable technical skill. That did not prevent us, however, from enjoying ourselves mightily, so interesting and pleasant was the company. Now, while I was eating my luncheon, and looking round me, I thought that America must certainly be much wealthier than the wealthiest of European countries. A woman as richly endowed with intellect and culture as my kind hostess, who lived by her pen in137 Paris, Rome, or London, would certainly earn less than she. And yet the foreign woman could live in better style, keep a servant to relieve her of the most troublesome and humble of her domestic duties, live in a large and less inflammable house, and have fresher and better prepared food to eat. If she married a man of her own station, she could more easily and with less stint, bring into the world, rear, and educate a family. From my hostess, I passed on to think of all the other persons of the same station in life, of those middle classes which are everywhere the support and foundation of democratic institutions and the great reserve of energy of modern civilisation. In New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, the great cities of the East, I had seen several families belonging to this class. I had even been the recipient of their confidences and complaints. At that moment, I realised clearly how much more difficult and laborious, owing to the greater cost of food and lodging, the extreme difficulty of finding servants, and the enormous expense of rearing, and still more of educating, children must be the life of those middle classes in the great cities of the United States than in the great cities of Europe. Like my hostess, a business clerk, a humble employé, or an artisan in the most select industries, though he gains less in Paris or in London than in New York, can live much better in the former towns. He can eat better, lodge more comfortably, employ someone to help in the household, and rear his family without excessive drudgery. 138 Then I asked myself: “But what is the use of wealth, then, if it is not a means of living better, of securing some extra ease, comfort, or pleasure? What is the reason for this startling paradox, of riches turning from a blessing into a torment? How comes it that America, which has shown such energy in the exploitation of the immense wealth hidden in her boundless territory, has not followed up her conquests by converting these riches to the benefit of the whole population? How is it that, in this fortunate country, it is these middle classes who suffer most who yet have an influence on the Government such as they have in no European country? Why can we find in poorer countries individuals and classes who are happier because they are better satisfied with their condition?” It was by reflecting on this problem that I at last arrived at a comprehension of the real nature of American progress, and that I finally lighted on the subject, the frame, and the key of the dialogue over which I had so long worried. How and in what way, I shall recount in the following chapter.",
        "target_summary": "While meditating mid-ocean, the author decided against writing another typical travelogue about South America. Instead, he conceived a book contrasting America's concept of progress with Europe's traditional views, imagining it as a dialogue between Europeans and Americans on a transatlantic liner—a rare modern setting for extended, serious discussion.\n\nHowever, after returning to Europe, his attempts to write this dialogue felt \"cold, dead, and academic\"; the vivid ideas of progress seemed to lose their distinctness. He nearly abandoned the project, questioning the reality of American progress. An unexpected invitation from President Roosevelt in early 1908 to visit the White House revived his interest. This presented a crucial opportunity to experience the United States, which he considered the embodiment of the New World, complementing his prior South American travels. He temporarily set aside his book idea, preparing for his US trip and scheduled lectures on Roman history.\n\nArriving in New York in November 1908, the author plunged into three months of intense activity, travelling extensively, interviewing diverse individuals from millionaires to artisans, and observing various aspects of American society. During this period, the \"demon of American progress,\" which had seemed to fade in Europe, reappeared in a \"gigantic, monstrous, unrestrained\" form, startling him with its energy and novelty. This reignited his desire to deeply understand this phenomenon.\n\nA breakthrough occurred during a luncheon with a cultured, middle-class author in a modest New York apartment. The author realized that despite America's wealth, his hostess's life was more demanding than a similarly talented European woman's, who could afford domestic help and enjoy a better standard of living for less cost. He extended this observation to the broader American middle classes, noting their lives in major US cities were significantly harder and more expensive—especially regarding housing, food, and raising children—compared to their European counterparts, despite often earning more. This \"startling paradox\"—why America's immense wealth didn't translate into a better, easier life for its influential middle classes—became the key to understanding the true nature of American progress and provided the essential framework for his long-stalled dialogue.",

        "title": "FACTS AND MOTIVES IN THE MODERN WORLD",
        "content": "Like every other European, I had gone to North America with the fixed idea that it was the country of the practical spirit par excellence, and that the Americans were all men who did not lose themselves in dreams, but lived in reality, intent on shaping it to their own ends, and acquiring by the most rapid means the tangible and sure blessings of life—riches, prosperity, power, and the mastery over nature. I was convinced that they knew better than anyone else the art of increasing the comforts, and diminishing the difficulties, of life by the intelligent use of the means furnished by nature, fortune, and preceding generations. I expected, therefore, to find in America, many facts and few ideas; an intelligent and vigorous egoism omnipresent; scanty traces of idealism, and but little faith in the transcendent principles which so often lead dreamers—individuals and nations—to toil and fight for fair but unreal chimeras, in the vain hope of distant glory or grandeur. So my first surprise, and a very great one it was,140 arose from my examination at close quarters, of the policy pursued by the United States in dealing with the immense herds of immigrants, who yearly pour into their harbours from all parts of the Old World. In South America, I had closely observed the cautious prudence and really practical sagacity with which the republics try to prevent the continual immigration of foreigners from disturbing too profoundly the political balance of the State, by reserving the government to small oligarchies born and educated in the country, and therefore capable of directing public affairs with a certain continuity of projects and of national spirit. This policy of the South American republics is, I know, severely criticised in Europe, and especially in Italy, by too many persons who judge the affairs of the New World by the standard of the ideas of the Old. But to a historian of Rome, like myself, to whom history has taught the great internal difficulties which were caused in every ancient state by the μέτοιχοι or peregrini, this policy seemed practical and reasonable, at least if it be granted that the principal task of every state is that of solving in the best possible way the problems of the hour and leaving to the future its own problems. To grant every year citizenship in a new state to a great number of men born and educated in distant lands, who come stuffed with ideas and tendencies, opinions which correspond in no wise with the utterly different situation they find in the new country; to give them political rights which they do not want or give a141 thought to; to make them, almost by force, the pillars of a political constitution which they generally do not understand; to hope to transform them in a flash from subjects of ancient European monarchies into citizens of young American republics—is not all this to do violence to the practical ideas of government, and to multiply the already great difficulties among which every representative régime works, without any compensating advantage, not even that of planting the immigrants firmly in the new country? The vast multitudes which are to-day crossing from Europe to America no longer go, as they did once, in search of liberty beyond the ocean. They go in search of higher salaries, an easier and larger existence, and greater probability of bettering themselves. To open to the children of immigrants on the same terms as to home-born children the high schools, the professions, and the public offices—in short, all the roads by which the son of a peasant or artisan can climb to the higher bourgeoisie—is a surer means of planting firmly in the country the crowds carried to America on the wave of emigration than the concession to them of electoral rights. And that is just what the states of South America, with their practical spirit, have done and are doing. With these impressions and opinions, I arrived from South America in the America which symbolises in the eyes of the world the practical spirit. And in this America, to my no small surprise, I found the opposite policy to this in actual operation, with all the effects142 which I imagined must follow it; in particular, the growing difficulty of making democratic institutions work smoothly, with an electoral body so swollen, so enormous, and so varied and heterogeneous. I often had occasion, when speaking or writing in the United States, to remember that the cosmopolitan electoral body which is the base of the democracy of the United States recalls that of Rome, where the freedmen—the immigrants of the time—became citizens, and were inscribed in the electoral lists, whatever their national origin, and even if they were all foreigners, barbarians some of them, uncivilised the rest. Nevertheless, there is between the United States and Ancient Rome one essential difference; and that is, that in the Roman Republic, the electoral operations were concentrated in the capital, so that the number of persons who took part in them, the really active electoral body, was extremely small; while in the United States, the electors are numbered by millions, and are scattered over a continent. Do not most of the difficulties and inconveniences of which I have heard America complain in connection with its internal politics arise from the enormous size of the electoral body and from its heterogeneity? For both of these are unique phenomena in the history of the world, as until now every democracy has governed small, and often the tiniest of, states. So this experiment, which America is making, without being compelled to do so by any historical necessity, is a new and bold one, the final result of143 which it is difficult to foretell. As a matter of fact, the ancient national oligarchies, which governed North America, for so many years after it had gained its independence, did not open the doors of the constitution to the immigrant multitudes who threatened, if admitted, to swamp them. It would have been easy to keep at least the first Europe-born generation out of politics, because—as I have already said—the greater number of immigrants arrive in America without the vaguest idea, much less ambition, of obtaining what, in a democracy, are the political rights of a citizen, and only want big salaries. How, then, has the United States come to this pass? Certainly historical accidents have contributed to set the Union in this direction. Historical accidents would, however, not have sufficed, if they had not been helped by that conception of democracy, not practical but mystical, so to speak, which I have found obtains among so many Americans. The rights of the people are not in America a political doctrine, to be employed by the nation and its governors in compassing certain ends of general utility, and to be applied only in the measure and with the limitations and qualifications which make it fruitful of good results and prevent it from giving rise to inconveniences. It is a transcendent principle, an article of faith, as it were, to be applied and developed without too much regard to the immediate consequences, which must be endured with patience if they are for the moment unpleasant or144 dangerous, in the conviction that the principle, being just and true, must finally produce beneficial effects. So, little by little, I was led to ask myself whether by chance, in politics at any rate, the South Americans and the Europeans were not more practical than the North Americans, and whether the North Americans, on the other hand, were not great idealists; at least, if by the practical spirit is understood the art of solving present difficulties by the quickest and simplest devices with only an immediately realisable benefit in view, instead of multiplying difficulties with future benefits in view or for love of an idea or a principle. The amazement and uncertainty caused by this preliminary survey of the very foundations of the American constitution were increased, however, by my subsequent observation of the numberless philanthropic works, educational institutions, intellectual, political, or social foundations which owe their existence to the inexhaustible generosity of the American upper classes. For though Europeans may think that every American thinks only of making money, a few weeks of travel and of observation were enough to convince me that America is quite as richly, perhaps more richly endowed than Europe with wealthy men whose only thought it is to spend their money for the good of their fellows, for the progress of the nation, in a word, for objects of public utility. However, though American philanthropic works may equal and often exceed those of Europe in number and145 in value, I have often had occasion to notice one difference between those of the two continents: and that is, that the American works are not unusually inspired by a more intense, I might almost say a more ingenuous faith in the power of man over the miseries and difficulties of life. The American often addresses himself with fervour, energy, and great intellectual and pecuniary effort to the eradication of ills which the European regards as incurable and irresponsive to treatment. And this American faith in the power to rectify, revive, and purify nature often struck me, no less than many other Europeans, as fringing on the chimerical. In short, even in what are called social works, the American often seemed to me more idealist, more of a dreamer, and less practical than the European; more ready, that is to say, to venture on a struggle against the innumerable ills of life without being quite sure of possessing adequate means for conquering them, at the summons of a mystical faith in the progress of the world. As the result of all my observations, I kept asking myself whether by chance the United States, notwithstanding their great practical activity, might not be a much more mystical, idealistic, and visionary people than the European gives them credit for. But I did not dare answer the question with a resolute Yes or No. I could not answer No, because that would have involved ignoring facts which were daily obtruding themselves on my notice. On the other hand, I dared not146 answer Yes, because I was afraid of being accused of excessive fondness for paradoxes, and of wishing to do violence to current opinions at every opportunity and at all costs. So I went groping around for a truth which so far I conjectured rather than saw.",
        "target_summary": "The author initially arrived in North America expecting to find a supremely practical people, focused on tangible gains like wealth, prosperity, and mastery over nature, excelling at efficient problem-solving without being swayed by idealistic dreams or transcendent principles.\n\nHis first significant surprise was the United States' immigration policy. He had observed South American republics cautiously limiting immigrant political influence, preserving governance for native-born elites to ensure political stability—a strategy he, as a Roman historian familiar with ancient \"peregrini\" and their destabilizing effects, found practical and reasonable. In contrast, the U.S. rapidly granted citizenship and political rights to immense, diverse immigrant populations. He viewed this as impractical, arguing that these new citizens, often not seeking political rights and unfamiliar with American governance, would inevitably complicate democratic institutions. He contended that economic integration—providing access to education, professions, and public offices—was a far more practical means of firmly settling immigrants, who primarily sought economic betterment, than bestowing electoral rights, a method he saw South America employing effectively.\n\nArriving in the U.S., the author found this \"opposite policy\" in operation, observing increasing difficulties in democratic governance due to an \"enormous, varied, and heterogeneous\" electorate. He compared the U.S. system to ancient Rome, where freedmen became citizens, but noted a critical distinction: Rome's active electoral body was small and centralized, whereas the U.S. has millions of voters spread across a continent. He saw this vast, diverse electorate as a unique, bold, and historically unprecedented experiment, not compelled by necessity, as earlier American oligarchies had resisted opening the constitution to immigrants. He attributed this distinct U.S. approach not merely to historical accidents, but to a \"mystical\" rather than practical conception of democracy, wherein \"the rights of the people\" are treated as a transcendent article of faith, to be applied universally, even if immediate consequences are problematic, in the belief that the principle itself guarantees eventual beneficial effects.\n\nThis led him to reconsider who was truly \"practical.\" His bewilderment deepened upon observing the extensive philanthropic works and institutions funded by wealthy Americans. Despite the European perception of Americans as purely money-driven, he found American philanthropy to be remarkably generous, often surpassing European efforts in scale and value. He noted a key difference, however: American philanthropic endeavors were frequently inspired by an \"intense, almost ingenuous faith\" in humanity's power to overcome life's miseries. Americans would fervently tackle problems Europeans considered incurable, making them appear more idealistic, even \"chimerical,\" and less practical than their European counterparts, ready to embark on struggles against immense ills with a mystical belief in progress, rather than assured means.\n\nUltimately, these observations prompted the author to question whether the United States, despite its reputation for practical activity, was in fact a more mystical, idealistic, and visionary nation than generally perceived by Europeans. He couldn't definitively affirm this due to fear of being seen as paradoxical, yet he couldn't deny it either, given the overwhelming evidence, leaving him still seeking a conclusive understanding.",

        "content": "I had reached this point in my reflections and observations when I was invited to luncheon by our friend the author and journalist whom I have mentioned in the preceding chapter. When I saw her home and mode of life, I could not help asking myself: For what reason is the general standard of wealth higher, while that of living is no higher, in America than in Europe? Why are dwellings in the great American cities so small, the distances so great, the communications so difficult, provisions so dear, that notwithstanding the vast riches of the country, life is for the masses and the middle classes more expensive and difficult than in many much less wealthy cities of Europe? The primary answer was not difficult: Because the cities have become too big and populous, because their growth has been too rapid in comparison with the progress of agriculture, and because a section at least of their inhabitants has contracted too expensive habits and is accustomed to a life of too great luxury. This primary answer, however, gave rise to a second question: Why have the cities grown so rapidly, and with the cities the luxury of every class? This too was easily explained: Because of the rapid development of industries. America is a vast continent of great147 natural wealth, where capital accumulates rapidly. Owing to her ability to accumulate capital readily, and to find work for the numberless hands which the overcrowded districts of Europe have been supplying for the last hundred years to those American countries which have need of them, America has been able, not only to extend her agriculture rapidly and to exploit her mines, but also, and in particular, to multiply her industries to the point of packing her larger cities with so dense a crowd of inhabitants that life has become difficult for the majority of the town populations. At this point, however, one conclusion seemed to emerge from the preceding observations. Suppose North America, instead of employing all the capital at her disposal in her many industries, as well as the capital borrowed from European countries poorer than herself, had done as France is doing in Europe, namely, had invested part of her capital in foreign countries, in loans to governments, cities, railways, industries, trades, and agricultural enterprises, what would have happened? The demand for labour would doubtless have been less in America, and therefore the emigration to it would not have been so startling. Her industries would have developed less, and her cities would not have increased so rapidly. The United States would now have a smaller population to support, and one better distributed between the cities and the country; would have fewer cities, and those smaller. The band of fortunates who have made huge wealth out of the148 rapid and prodigious development of the cities would be smaller, but the middle and lower classes would enjoy a more comfortable and easier existence. Their condition would resemble much more closely that of the middle and lower classes in Europe. They would earn lower wages, but those wages, though numerically less, would procure them greater comforts and pleasures. It was now that, after my many discussions with others, and my extended solitary meditation on the difficult problem, I thought that I had finally confuted the troublesome doctrine of American progress. What is that progress of which the Americans are so proud but the unbridled rush of enterprise which has so rapidly multiplied the industries, enlarged the cities, and increased the population and wealth of the United States? But in that case it was clear that American progress contradicted itself. By inciting the American people to gather together capital and workers, to open their gates to millions of European emigrants, to invest their gains in new enterprises or in the enlargement of old enterprises, to redouble and multiply in every direction efforts and enterprises, so as to form of them a mountain with which to scale the heavens, the spirit of progress had created in America an opulence which teemed with difficulties, contradictions, and embarrassments, and which meant for a large part of the population a condition somewhat resembling that of King Midas: seeing riches all round him, and not being able to enjoy them. But to produce riches with no prospect149 of enjoying them is an absurdity. Much wiser, therefore, was old Europe, which, taught by the experience of centuries, refused to let herself be dazzled by this idea of progress, and instead of heaping up riches at top speed as does the New World, was more careful in her choice of new riches to create so that she might enjoy them; so that she might make of them a fount of well-being, not a cause of difficulty for mankind. This was the moment at which I was inclined to think that all the ideas of America and the optimistic spirit which animates them, beginning with the idea of progress, could only be a passing ebullition and the merry madness of youth. This nation, I said to myself, favoured as it is at the moment by unusual facilities for the creation of wealth, has been so much carried away by its success as to make of riches, which are and can be only a means, an end in themselves. A longer experience of history will convince America of its mistake. One day, however, as I was again pondering intently over the facts I had observed, which seemed to prove that the Americans were often dreamers, idealists, almost mystics in matters in which the Europeans show themselves eminently practical, an idea flashed across my mind. What if American progress, which to me had seemed up to then to be but a youthful madness, should prove, if thoroughly analysed, to be only an idealistic and semi-mystical conception of wealth itself? What if this nation, accused of desiring only the immediate possession of worldly goods, was150 wearing itself out in an unbridled and diabolical activity from dawn till sundown, not with the object of increasing its happiness and pleasure, but for a distant end, transcending the egoism and even the consciousness of the individual? What if all, without knowing it, or impelled as it were by a superior, if not directly mystical force, were labouring and even suffering for this end—a new end, to which history can show us no parallel; the conquest of an immense continent from one sea to the other, by means of a new instrument unknown to our forefathers: steam- or electricity-driven machinery?",
        "target_summary": "After a meal with a journalist friend, the author questioned why America, despite its greater overall wealth compared to Europe, did not offer a higher standard of living for its general population. Specifically, American cities appeared expensive and difficult, with small dwellings, vast distances, and costly provisions, making life harder for the masses and middle classes than in less wealthy European cities.\n\nThe author's initial answer attributed this to cities growing too large and rapidly, outpacing agricultural progress, and fostering luxurious habits among some inhabitants. This led to a further question: why such rapid urban growth and increased luxury? The explanation was rapid industrial development. America's ability to accumulate capital and attract European labor allowed it to expand agriculture, exploit mines, and multiply industries, consequently packing cities with dense populations and making life challenging.\n\nThe author then considered an alternative: if America had invested capital abroad like France, its demand for labor would have been less, immigration slower, industrial development curtailed, and cities smaller and fewer. While the wealthiest elite might be smaller, the middle and lower classes would enjoy a more comfortable and easier existence, similar to Europe, with lower but more satisfying wages.\n\nInitially, the author concluded that \"American progress\"—this aggressive drive to multiply industries, expand cities, and increase wealth and population—was contradictory. It created immense opulence that was difficult to enjoy, akin to King Midas. In contrast, \"old Europe,\" taught by centuries of experience, seemed wiser by prioritizing the enjoyment of wealth over its rapid accumulation, making it a source of well-being, not difficulty. The author initially dismissed American optimism and progress as merely a \"youthful madness\" that mistakenly treated wealth as an end in itself.\n\nHowever, during further reflection, a new idea emerged. The author pondered whether American progress, which had seemed like a youthful impracticality, might in fact be an idealistic or semi-mystical conception of wealth. Perhaps Americans, unknowingly or driven by a higher, almost mystical force, were toiling relentlessly—not for immediate pleasure—but for a distant, transcendent goal: the conquest of an immense continent using new, powerful steam and electricity-driven machinery, an unprecedented historical endeavor.",

        "content": "From progress, from the democratic and philanthropic ideality of the Americans, from the economic difficulties with which our kind hostess had to wrestle, to machinery and to the conquest of the great territory of the United States, may seem a risky, violent, and unexpected transition or transitions. As a matter of fact, I could not have executed so bold a transition unaided. I was helped by my wife, in an indirect, but, for that very reason, strange and decisive way. In fact, without her help I should not have succeeded in finding my bearings in the chaos of my American experiences, nor in understanding how and to what extent the Old World and the New World are opposed to each other; as a result, I could not have written the philosophical dialogue on Europe and America, which will be published shortly. It seems to me necessary, then,151 to recount how this help was given me; and I hope that my brief account will not be read without interest. Several years before we embarked on our journeys to the two Americas, my wife had begun a long and deep study of modern machinery and of the great mechanical industry. Though a daughter of Cesare Lombroso, who was a great inventor, she is temperamentally inclined to the ancient more than to the new, and therefore little disposed by nature to admire the gigantic disorder of modern society which other minds find so intoxicating. Her innate antipathy to the civilisation of steam and electricity had been increased a thousandfold by observation of the profound perturbation which the great mechanical industry has caused in a country of ancient civilisation like Italy, densely populated and living on the resources of a small territory devoid of great natural riches. But when she at last made of machinery an object of methodical study, her researches and the evidence she had patiently accumulated transformed this antipathy into a complex and bold theory, the cardinal idea of which I think I can express as follows. Machinery produces only apparent wealth and prosperity, because instead of diminishing the effort necessary to produce the things we need, and therefore their price, in reality it increases it. The mechanical industry demands immense capital to construct the machines and set them going; immense quantities of raw material to keep the machinery always busy; the concentration152 of the industry in places where combustibles or the motive forces abound; consequently an enormous development in the means of communication, for the exchange of products and raw materials, and a dense population accustomed to produce and consume as much as possible. Therefore, the civilisation of steam- or electricity-driven machines cannot develop without rapidly exhausting nature, so to speak—mines, or forests, or the fertility of the soil. That explains why it flourishes chiefly in vast and naturally wealthy territories, which it rapidly exploits and impoverishes. Indeed, it explains why it is always seeking for new, rich territories, seeking to penetrate unexplored continents, like Africa, as soon as it has conquered America. Nor is it difficult to understand why nations which live in countries of limited natural resources get more harm than good, and often become involved in vexatious crises, from the introduction of mechanical civilisation. It is clear, too, how that civilisation must result in making life ever more and more expensive, and therefore forcing men to despoil the earth and to work ever harder, without ever attaining to satisfaction. These ideas were the subject of long and lively discussions between my wife, her father, and myself. These discussions, as was natural with discussions arising out of a doctrine which was maturing in the mind of a patient seeker after truth, were, so to speak, eccentric; they revolved now round one point, now round another. Nevertheless, the central point round which they ultimately153 revolved was this: whether the wealth for which man has to thank machinery is real or apparent. I said that, since machinery produces much and at great speed, there seemed to me no room for doubt that it increased the sum of benefits at man’s disposal, and therefore enriched the world. My wife replied that if machinery produces much, it also consumes enormously, more indeed than it produces, so that a mechanical civilisation must always feel itself tormented by the necessity of having more than it possesses, and, therefore, must be always in a state of indigence. So the discussions went on, lively and long, without either of the parties convincing the other; and at last I came to the conclusion that our amour propre must be making us persist in the sophistical discussion of an unreal question. When I got to America, however, I saw that the question we were discussing was anything but unreal; for it was these ideas and discussions which enabled me to collate our friend’s economic difficulties with the mystical spirit which pervades so large a part of American life, and to understand the nature of American progress. Were not the economic difficulties encountered especially in the big cities, notwithstanding the immense wealth of the country, by the most numerous classes of America, the decisive proof that really, as my wife asserted, the wealth created by a mechanical civilisation is to some extent only apparent? That notwithstanding the great depredation of nature154 carried out with means furnished by science, men’s needs increase faster than their riches; therefore that mechanical civilisation revolves in the vicious circle of an insoluble contradiction? All the same, if America had set herself with less eagerness to exploit by means of machinery her immense natural resources; if she had not welcomed so many millions of men from all parts of the world; if she had not invested in machinery and industries and railways such a vast amount of capital, without a doubt we should find a smaller number of people living, and living more comfortably, in America to-day; but the conquest of the vast continent would not have reached its present pitch, and the world would not have witnessed that unparalleled event in its history, the bewildering development of the United States. In fact, we must not forget, if we wish to realise what a miracle the civilisation of machinery has succeeded in accomplishing in the New World, how slow and difficult was the expansion of mankind over the world up to the end of the eighteenth century, that is, during a period when men worked with their hands and travelled over their planet on their own legs, or on those of animals little swifter than themselves. The great plains acted as so many great barriers in the way of men’s occupation of the land, because men lost their way in them. Consequently men tended to settle on little tracts of land, in such a way as to be near one another, to be able to communicate easily155 with one another, and to exchange their products. Everybody knows how slow has been in Europe the advance of civilisation from south to north; how many centuries were required for the passage of the Alps and expansion into Gaul, how many for the crossing of the Rhine and extension as far as the Elbe, and again for the passage of the Elbe and the advance towards the Vistula and the great plains of Eastern Europe. In America itself—in the South as well as in the North—up to the end of the eighteenth century, the progress of population and civilisation was very slow and difficult.",
        "target_summary": "The author struggled to coherently connect diverse American realities—from progress and democratic ideals to economic difficulties, machinery, and territorial conquest. His wife's indirect yet crucial assistance proved essential, enabling him to navigate his American experiences, understand the opposition between the Old and New Worlds, and ultimately write his philosophical dialogue.\n\nInitially disinclined towards modern advancements despite being the daughter of inventor Cesare Lombroso, his wife's temperament leaned towards the ancient. Her inherent dislike for the \"civilisation of steam and electricity\" was intensified by observing its disruptive impact on resource-poor Italy. However, her methodical study of machinery transformed this antipathy into a complex theory: machinery generates only *apparent* wealth and prosperity. Instead of reducing effort and price, it increases them by demanding immense capital, raw materials, concentrated industry where motive forces abound, extensive communication for trade, and a large populace to produce and consume. Consequently, this civilization rapidly exhausts natural resources—mines, forests, soil—flourishing in and then depleting vast, naturally wealthy territories, and perpetually seeking new ones globally. For nations with limited resources, it often causes crises, making life more expensive and forcing ceaseless labor without true satisfaction.\n\nThe author, his wife, and her father frequently debated whether machinery's wealth was real or apparent. The author believed machinery's high output increased overall benefits and enriched the world. His wife countered that it consumes more than it produces, creating perpetual indigence and a constant need for more than it possesses.\n\nUpon visiting America, the author realized the profound reality of their debate. The widespread economic difficulties in American cities, affecting numerous classes despite national wealth, confirmed his wife's assertion that mechanical civilization creates largely *apparent* wealth, trapping humanity in a \"vicious circle\" where needs escalate faster than riches, despite extensive natural exploitation.\n\nNevertheless, the author acknowledges the immense achievement: had America not so eagerly exploited its vast resources with machinery, welcomed millions of immigrants, and invested heavily, there would be fewer, more comfortable people. However, the unparalleled conquest and bewildering development of the vast continent would not have occurred. This astounding progress was only possible through machinery, contrasting sharply with the historically slow and arduous human expansion before the late eighteenth century, when movement and settlement were limited by manual labor and slow travel across the globe.",

        "content": "In the twentieth century, on the other hand, a prodigy occurred, thanks to steam-engines and all the other machines of which the steam-engine is the parent. With these machines, men can exploit more rapidly and thoroughly all the wealth of the earth, and with the railways can export the wealth produced, even from the most remote and buried regions, which thus can be peopled and exploited. Civilisation, following the railway-lines, and armed with fire and machines, in little more than fifty years extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific, crossing and occupying, however summarily, the immense territories of the interior, and binding together with a network of communications and interests, cities, climates, and territories without number from east to west, from north to south. But machinery is an inanimate instrument, only to be imbued with creative force by the thought and will of man. In consequence, this miracle of history would not have156 come about if a bold and energetic people had not multiplied machines with extraordinary rapidity over the whole immensity of their territory; if they had not subordinated to this supreme end every other good, æsthetic beauty, the preservation of traditions, the purity of the national spirit, and even the conveniences of life which wealth can give. American progress is then a transcendent and mystical idea which inflames America with passion and impels it to accomplish the new and rapid conquest of its own territory. And logic wastes its time looking for and laying bare contradictions in it savouring of the absurd. Doubtless, to work with frenzied zeal at creating riches in order to be unable to enjoy them is an absurdity if judged in the light of the interest of each individual; but are not all ideals absurd, when judged in the light of the interest of the individual? What does it matter to the soldier who dies in battle that his country emerges victorious from the conflict in which it is engaged, seeing that he will not be able to enjoy the fruits of the victory? From the point of view of personal interest, it is better to live in a country disgraced and diminished by a defeat than to die in a country aggrandised by a victory. So the privations to which I had seen exposed in the intimacy of her home, that kind hostess of ours, who had offered us luncheon in her modest flat, no longer seemed an absurd contradiction of life. Her privations were transfigured into a small personal sacrifice necessary for the fulfilment of a great national work, transcending157 the interest and the wishes of every individual American.",
        "target_summary": "In the twentieth century, steam engines and related machines revolutionized human capabilities, enabling the rapid exploitation and export of Earth's wealth, even from remote regions, via railways. This led to civilization's swift expansion, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific in just over fifty years, connecting numerous cities and territories with a vast network of communications and interests. However, this historical \"miracle\" was not merely mechanical; it required human thought and will, specifically from a bold and energetic people. America exemplified this by rapidly deploying machines across its territory, prioritizing this objective above other values like aesthetic beauty, tradition, national spirit, or personal comforts derived from wealth. This \"American progress\" is depicted as a transcendent, mystical idea driving the energetic conquest of its own land. While the intense effort to create wealth without enjoying it might seem absurd from an individual's perspective, it mirrors other ideals, like a soldier's sacrifice, which transcend personal interest. Thus, individual privations, such as those observed in a hostess's modest home, are reinterpreted not as a contradiction, but as a small personal sacrifice contributing to a grand national endeavor that surpasses individual desires.",

        "content": "Thus at last I had grasped American progress and its apparent incongruities. It was an ideal of life, born and rapidly matured in a new continent during the past half century, at a time when the conquest of the vast territory by means of machinery was becoming more widespread and more intense. It was the ideal of life which, overshadowing all the others, had called forth from the depths of American society the marvellous energy which has staggered the world. When I had once found the key to this enigma, many phenomena of American life seemed to me clearer. I could easily explain to myself why the public attached less weight to politics on that side than in Europe, and regarded the defects and shortcomings in its political institutions with an indifference which to Europeans seems strange; in particular, why it preferred having them in a condition full of defects and inconveniences rather than any reform which increased the power of the State and limited the initiative of the individual. I could explain also how it had succeeded in keeping alive that spirit of liberty, not in politics only, but in religion, administration, customs, and culture which often strikes Europeans as either excessive or bizarre. The great national work—the conquest of the continent—is accomplished much more by personal initiative than with the help and under the direction of the State; the important point,158 therefore, is that personal energy should be subjected in this great work to the smallest possible number of limits and restrictions. Lastly, I could explain why in American society, to borrow a rather quaint philosophical expression, the category of quantity prevails over that of quality. During my first few weeks in America, I used to smile when I heard some Americans go into ecstasies at the thought that everything in America was big, from the country to the cities, the factories, and the statistics of population; when they gloated over comparisons between their own country and the little countries of Europe, and statements of the comparative superiority in size of things in their own country. I no longer smiled, however, when I realised what American progress represented. A civilisation, whose principal instrument for the accomplishment of its work and for establishing itself in the world is machinery, must necessarily consider the quantitative criterion the supreme criterion of perfection. In what respect, indeed, is machinery, regarded as an instrument of production, superior to the human hand? Everybody knows that its superiority consists not in quality, but in the quantity, of its output. Machinery produces much and quickly. The hand produces little and slowly. The hand, however, can attain a standard of perfection which is denied machinery. Man will never succeed in constructing a machine capable of sculpturing the Venus of Milo or of weaving the marvellous tapestries which159 we admire in the museums of Europe. Everything of a high degree of perfection is exclusively handmade; vice versa, the hand, however, it may strive and labour and practise, will never succeed in attaining in its work the giddy rapidity of which steam- and electricity-driven machines are capable, or in producing in so short a time so many good things. Consequently, in a civilisation in which machinery predominates, men will be continually making fresh efforts to live faster and faster, and to produce and consume more and more rapidly. They will not be, on the other hand, too exacting on the score of quality. They will be content with things which look nice, without demanding extraordinary excellence or finish in details. They will be better pleased to consume many examples of products of inferior durability than one single example of products of great perfection. Consequently, vagaries of taste, continual movement, ready forgetfulness of traditions, and abundance of mediocrity, will be salient characteristics of machine-ruled civilisation. The great works of art which were the glory of past régimes will disappear for the present, which will see them replaced by objects of medium quality offered in greater quantity. As a matter of fact, I found all these characteristics in North America, and they no longer offended me. They seemed to me necessary qualities of a society which sets out to conquer a boundless territory with machinery. Nevertheless, at this point, having solved160 the American problem, I was confronted with the European problem under a new aspect. If American progress, if machinery, if the quantitative criterion of perfection are necessary weapons for the accomplishment of the great historical work to which the United States have set themselves, how are we to explain the fact that in the states of Europe also machines are being multiplied, the American idea of progress is spreading, and the quantitative criterion of perfection is prevailing gradually? All of them except Russia, which in many respects resembles the United States, are countries of an old civilisation, live in small tracts of territory, and have not immense continents to exploit. At this point I saw hovering over Europe and America a new, vaster, and more general problem, which dominates the two worlds and bestrides the Atlantic like a great bridge: the struggle between quantity and quality.",
        "target_summary": "The author ultimately grasped \"American progress\" as an ideal of life born from the rapid, machine-driven conquest of a vast continent over the past fifty years, which unleashed America's astonishing energy. This insight clarified several American phenomena: a relative indifference to political shortcomings compared to Europe, a preference for individual initiative over expanded state power, and a pervasive spirit of liberty across politics, religion, and culture. The national project of conquering the continent, driven by personal effort, minimized the need for state intervention.\n\nThis understanding also explained why quantity often supersedes quality in American society. While initially finding Americans' exaltation of sheer size across various domains amusing, the author realized its basis. A civilization built on machinery, whose primary advantage lies in the quantity and speed of its output rather than the qualitative perfection of handmade items (like art), naturally elevates quantitative criteria as the ultimate measure of excellence.\n\nAs a result, a machine-dominated society continuously strives to live, produce, and consume faster, becoming less demanding about quality. People prefer consuming numerous moderately durable products over a single, highly perfected one. This fosters shifting tastes, a disregard for tradition, and a prevalence of mediocrity, with mass-produced, medium-quality goods replacing exceptional artistic achievements. The author found these traits to be necessary for a society conquering a boundless territory with machinery.\n\nHowever, solving the \"American problem\" then illuminated a \"European problem\": if these characteristics are essential for America's unique historical task, why are machines, the American concept of progress, and the quantitative criterion similarly spreading in older, smaller European nations (excluding Russia), which lack vast continents to exploit?

        "content": "It is an undoubted fact that Europe is becoming Americanised; that the American idea of progress—understood to mean the increase of wealth and the perfectioning of the instruments of production—is penetrating European society. No profound knowledge of European society is needed to recognise this. I would even go so far as to say that the only idea which in the last fifty years has sunk deep into the minds of the masses in Europe is this American idea of progress. I must, however, also confess that before I went to America I belonged to that group of Europeans, numerous enough, especially among the cultured and upper classes, which laments this “Americanisation” of Europe, and considers it to be a sort of mental aberration and decadence on the part of the Old World. The idea is fairly wide-spread in Europe. It may startle a good many Americans; but it will not seem paradoxical to those who spare a moment’s reflection for the history of European civilisation up to the French Revolution. 162 There is no doubt that, considered from the point of view of our ancient history, this idea of progress, interpreted American-fashion, is a kind of revolutionary dissolving force. Perhaps the upheaval which it has produced and is producing in Europe can almost be compared with that which Christianity caused in the ancient civilisation, when it destroyed in the Greco-Latin world the political and military spirit which had been the mainstay of that world. Indeed, we must not forget that from the dawn of history up to the French Revolution succeeding generations had lived in Europe contented with little, faithful to traditions, and holding every innovation to be a danger and every enterprise a revolt against God and against the memory of their ancestors. It is true that even in those days men usually preferred ease to poverty and were not insensible to the magnetism of gold. Even then, each succeeding generation saw an increase in the wealth of the world and in the spread of population over the face of the earth. But how slow and spasmodic was the increase! Up to the time of the French Revolution it is impossible to discern in history any differences in wealth and population at intervals of less than a century. The change produced by each generation was so small as to be barely recognisable. In compensation, the men of that time strove to make the world fairer and better. Art and religion were their absorbing preoccupation. From Greece [says one of the characters in my dialogue], which taught the world to write and to sculp, up to the163 Middle Ages which built the fairest cathedrals and the most fantastic palaces of all times; from the Egypt of the Ptolemies, from which the last rays of Hellenic beauty illumined the Mediterranean world, up to the Rome of the popes and up to the Venice of the sixteenth century, which flaunted her marble pomp in the eyes of the world, up to the France of the eighteenth century, which immortalised her three sovereigns in three world-compelling decorative styles; from Augustus, who protected Horace and Virgil, up to Louis XIV, who protected Racine and Molière, and up to the Marquise de Pompadour, who strove to make Paris the metropolis of elegance,—was not the perpetuation of a form of beauty the supreme ambition of every nation and of every state? Consider the countless efforts made to establish in the world the reign either of sanctity or of justice or both, from the Roman Empire which created law, up to Christianity which strove to cleanse human nature of sin, and up to the French Revolution, which proclaimed to the world the age of liberty, fraternity, and equality. Such was that old Europe which created the numberless masterpieces of architecture, sculpture, and painting, now so much admired by the Americans; that old Europe which discovered America, created science, and produced the French Revolution. But what remains of that old Europe? American progress is busy to-day destroying it; in particular, the artistic spirit is rapidly disappearing from the continent which for centuries was the world’s teacher of beauty. Do you seriously believe [asks another of my characters, he who in the dialogue defends America and the new ideals164 of life] that it is any use nowadays lamenting the fact that some rare genius is unable at the present day to give birth to his immortal masterpiece in the solitude of his pride? At a time when man is inventing increasingly powerful machinery, and is conquering the earth, the sea, the air, the vast treasures hidden in every nook and cranny of the universe; with these marvellous tools in his hand is recognising that he is becoming the wizard visioned in the legends of centuries; while the masses are clamouring for bread, victuals, education, ease, security, pleasures, air, light, liberty, all God’s blessings in prodigious and yearly-increasing quantities? These words are not the vapourings of a fanciful individual. They are repeated a hundred times daily in Europe, in a more or less elegant form, for they express the kernel of the thought of the Europe which is being Americanised. I could quote many examples in support of my contention. I will quote one only, a characteristic one. A foreigner may often see in the smaller Italian cities ancient monuments—churches or palaces—which are gradually falling into ruin. The nonchalance of the authorities or the ignorance and stinginess of the proprietors suffer time to do its deadly work, or even help to accelerate it by befouling the last relics of a past beauty. The foreigner shakes his head, sighs, mutters harsh judgments, and asks himself sotto voce whether the inhabitants of that little town are barbarians. His stupor would be increased, however, if he could speak with one of the locals and open his mind freely to him. “We barbarians?”—would answer the local shop-keeper, lawyer, doctor, or artisan. To165 prove to the foreigner how wrong he was, they would tell him that that little town has actually got electric light! The municipality, which cannot find a few thousand francs for keeping this or that great monument in a decent state, will spend large sums on lighting with electric light streets in which after 9 P.M. there is nobody to be seen. The adoption of electric light is an act of progress, and nowadays even the shop-keeper and the artisan understand progress in this American sense; while, with the exception of a few cultured and art-loving persons, who have no influence whatever, nobody ever thinks it a barbarism to allow an old monument built by our fathers to fall into ruin. This is a trifling instance; but it indicates the new spirit which is now pervading and conquering the whole of Europe. The most evident proof of this triumph of American progress is the decadence or disappearance of all the schools of art. Europe was in past centuries, in harder and more difficult times than the present, the glorious mother and mistress of civilisation, because under diverse forms, she managed to create and keep going schools of literature, sculpture, painting, architecture, and music. To-day, these schools have almost all disappeared; and the few survivors, with very few exceptions, are in a state of decadence. On the other hand, schools of electricity, dyeing, weaving, mechanics, commerce, and chemistry abound and flourish; they are the only schools the masses now166 require. In past centuries, the states and aristocracies of Europe had in various ways protected and encouraged the arts; and this protection had been one of the principal reasons for their progress. Now this is no longer the case. The wealthy classes of Europe to-day consider it much more dignified and elegant to build motor-cars and aeroplanes than to help painting and sculpture. As to the states, if one of them tries to encourage some art, protests pour in from every side that the expenditure is a wasting of the people’s money in the most idiotic way. Italy was for centuries the mistress of the world in every art. Yet even in Italy bitter complaints are made to-day about the few millions which the public bodies have spent in the last thirty years in raising monuments to the great men of the Revolution. On the other hand, how can sculpture flourish, if nobody will pay the sculptors for the works which they are capable of executing? And for what reason is the State, which possesses ancient monuments, unable to spend another million or two on keeping alive the tradition of an art which has shed no little glory on the Nation? Is not this tradition, too, a national heirloom? But the first-born daughter of Beauty no longer understands these simple truths. Infected by the spirit of American progress, she protests that the money spent on art is wasted; she is right willing that hundreds of millions be spent on the encouragement of the mechanical and iron industries.",
        "target_summary": "Europe is increasingly adopting an \"Americanised\" view of progress, centered on accumulating wealth and perfecting production. This idea has profoundly influenced the European masses over the past fifty years. Initially, the author, like many cultured Europeans, considered this trend a sign of the Old World's mental decadence.\n\nHistorically, until the French Revolution, Europe was largely content with limited means, adhering to traditions, and viewing innovation as dangerous. Change in wealth and population was incredibly slow, almost imperceptible across centuries. Instead, the focus was on enhancing the world through art and religion, striving for beauty, sanctity, and justice. This \"old Europe\" birthed countless masterpieces in architecture, sculpture, and painting, from ancient Greece to the Middle Ages, and from the Roman Empire's legal innovations to Christianity's moral teachings and the French Revolution's ideals of liberty. It was this old Europe that discovered America, advanced science, and inspired the French Revolution.\n\nHowever, this American-style progress is now actively dismantling old Europe, particularly its artistic spirit. A prevailing sentiment, reflecting the Americanised European mindset, dismisses the lament for lost artistic genius, arguing that humanity's current focus should be on technological advancement and resource conquest to meet the masses' clamor for basic necessities, education, and security.\n\nThis shift is starkly evident in the neglect of ancient Italian monuments, where local authorities prioritize modern amenities like electric streetlights over artistic preservation, considering such modernizations \"progress\" even if traditional art is left to decay. This perspective, increasingly common even among ordinary citizens, sees no barbarism in allowing historical landmarks to crumble.\n\nConsequently, traditional art schools (literature, sculpture, painting, architecture, music) have largely disappeared or deteriorated across Europe. In contrast, technical schools—for electricity, dyeing, mechanics, commerce, and chemistry—are flourishing, catering to contemporary demands. Historically, European states and aristocracies championed the arts, fostering their progress. Today, however, wealthy Europeans prefer investing in technology like motor-cars and airplanes over supporting art. States attempting to fund art face widespread public protests, deemed a wasteful use of money. Even Italy, a beacon of artistic heritage, now complains about modest public spending on monuments while readily pouring hundreds of millions into mechanical and industrial sectors, revealing a profound loss of appreciation for its artistic traditions.",

        "content": "There is no need to wonder, therefore, if many Europeans regret the Americanisation of the old continent as a kind of grievous madness. Europe—especially its upper classes—lives a great deal—it could hardly help living—in its past history. I have already said, that I, too, when I undertook my journeys to America, was more or less of this same cast of thought. But in America, confronted with this frenzy of desires and of works which has attracted from all parts of the world and fused into one people so many millions of souls, has created so many cities and produced so much wealth, it was no longer possible for me to shut my eyes to the fact that so vast and profound a phenomenon must depend on causes much more complex and grave than a simple mistake or mental aberration. For what reason was Europe ready to destroy even her secular tradition of art for the sake of emulating that rapidity of execution and audacity of enterprise which I was then witnessing in the New World? This was the problem which presented itself to me, after I had grasped the meaning of American progress; and which I succeeded in solving with the help of my wife’s investigations into the history of machinery. “Christopher Columbus,” says one of my characters, in Between the Old World and the New, “not only discovered America, but re-endowed man with the globe which God had already given him, inasmuch as he enabled man at last to know it.” Europe had remained content up to the fifteenth century to live in her168 little territory, ignorant of how great the world was. That earlier limitation, however, only increased the force of the impulse, given to man by the discovery of America, to scour and ransack the oceans, with the object of discovering and possessing the whole plane. Between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries, then, Europe saw the world expanding around her. With the expansion of the world, however, came an increase in the longing to possess it, to master it, and to exploit it. How was Europe to do so, with means so scanty, and under the sway of the ancient ideas, which said to man, “Dare not!” which taught him to change as little as possible the order of things under which he had grown up, and not to yield to the temptation of over-ardent desires and of over-lofty ambitions? Then began, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, that effort of thought and of will which, slowly at first, was destined gradually to arm our civilisation with all the weapons necessary for the conquest and exploitation of the earth. The sciences began their advances. The first machines were invented and applied. The idea of liberty of progress, of the rights of man, and of the popular will began to undermine the ancient beliefs and traditions. Nevertheless, it is probable that these would have long resisted, and that the ancient ties which restrained the human will from the great enterprises would have slackened, but not broken for who knows how many more centuries, if it had not been for that immense event which convulsed the169 history of Europe and America, the French Revolution. The French Revolution and the great wars to which it gave rise made such and so great breaches in the ancient prison-walls of traditions and principles in which our civilisation was confined that man could thereafter easily escape through them and wander freely over the vast world. In fact, after the French Revolution, we see the beginning of a new history of the world. The ideas of liberty and of progress invade Europe and America. In every class and in every nation comes an awakening of new desires for comfort and culture. Industry develops, railways spread, inventions multiply. Cities become thronged and increase rapidly. The great new phenomenon of the history of the world, the intensive exploitation of America, begins. The new wealth, especially that produced in such abundance in America, whets men’s appetites. Gradually the desire for comfort, ease, and culture spreads to multitudes more numerous and to new nations, drives followers along in the steps of pioneers, in turn prompts others to follow them, and brings crowding on the heels of riches already realised, the hungry greed of the masses; in a word, impels all Europe and all America to the conquest of the earth. In consequence, not only America, but also Europe, saw the beginning fifty years ago of what might be truly called the Golden Age of human history, the epoch of abundance. 170 What has man dreamt of [exclaims one of my characters]—what has man dreamt of, since the dawn of time, but the Terrestrial Paradise, the Promised Land, the Garden of the Hesperides, the Age of Gold, Arabia Félix; one single thing, under various names, the empire of nature and abundance? Is not the great myth which centuries have mildly fantasied now at last materialising under our eyes? But every medal has its reverse side; and we have had to pay, and to pay dearly, for this fabulous abundance which man had vainly visioned for centuries.",
        "target_summary": "Many Europeans, especially the upper classes, regretting the \"Americanisation\" of their continent as a kind of madness, are deeply rooted in their past. The author, initially sharing this perspective during his travels to America, came to see the American \"frenzy of desires and works\" – its ability to attract and fuse millions, create cities, and generate immense wealth – as a profound phenomenon rooted in causes more complex than simple error. He began to question why Europe was abandoning its secular traditions, even in art, to emulate America's rapidity of execution and audacious enterprise. This problem was addressed through investigations into the history of machinery.\n\nThe discovery of America by Christopher Columbus was pivotal, as it not only found a new continent but also \"re-endowed man with the globe,\" revealing its true extent. Up to the fifteenth century, Europe had been content within its small territory. This earlier limitation, however, amplified the impulse, once America was discovered, to explore and possess the entire world. Between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, as the world expanded around Europe, so too did the longing to possess, master, and exploit it. This ambition faced obstacles in the form of Europe's scanty means and ancient ideas, which cautioned against change and overly ardent desires.\n\nConsequently, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries marked the beginning of a deliberate effort of thought and will to equip civilization for the conquest and exploitation of the earth. Sciences advanced, machines were invented, and ideas of liberty, progress, human rights, and popular will began to undermine old beliefs. However, these changes would likely have progressed much slower were it not for the French Revolution. This immense event convulsed European and American history, creating significant breaches in the \"ancient prison-walls\" of traditions and principles, thereby allowing humanity to break free and engage with the wider world.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, a new era began. Ideas of liberty and progress spread across Europe and America, awakening new desires for comfort and culture in all classes and nations. Industry developed, railways expanded, inventions multiplied, and cities grew rapidly. A major new historical phenomenon emerged: the intensive exploitation of America. The vast new wealth, particularly that generated in America, intensified human appetites. Gradually, the desire for comfort, ease, and culture spread, driving pioneers, followers, and the \"hungry greed of the masses\" to conquer the earth. This led, some fifty years prior to the writing, to what could truly be called the \"Golden Age\" or \"epoch of abundance\" for both America and Europe. While man had dreamt of such a \"Terrestrial Paradise\" for centuries, the author concludes that this fabulous abundance has come at a dear price.",

        "content": "The modern world [says another of my characters] has crowned quantity at the expense of quality—which is, after all, an eternal law. For I can make in a certain time things of a certain quality, that is to say, resembling a certain model of perfection which I have before my eyes or in my mind. But in that case, I cannot make any quantity of it which I may require. I must rest content with that quantity which I can manage, working with all my zeal. I can say, on the other hand: I want so many things of a certain quality. But in that case, I can no longer prescribe the time necessary to finish them as my fancy bids me. Or again: I wish in so much time to make such a quantity. Very well; but in that case, I must put up with the best quality I can get. So that whoever wants to increase the quantity, and to curtail the time must abate his demand for quality. And that is just what we are doing to-day in this civilisation of ours, in which quantity reigns supreme. In the light of this idea that decadence in art, and in so many other refinements of life, which many Europeans impute to America, seemed to me no longer the effect of an aberration on the part of the masses, but a171 sort of compensation. We pay, and we ought to pay, for the rapid fortunes so commonly made nowadays. We pay, we ought to pay, for the speed of the trains, the motor-cars, the aeroplane, the telegraph; and the price is the mediocrity which pervades everything. We cannot have, we must not want, everything in this world,—railways as well as beautiful pictures, aeroplanes as well as the marvellous furniture which the great French artists used to make in the eighteenth century, speed as well as good manners. For among the reproaches hurled at America by Europe is that of having banished from Europe by the example of her democracy the good manners of our ancient ceremonial, and substituted for it a rather over-simple and over-casual cordiality. But can we expect the polished form, for which the eighteenth century was famous, to survive in the social relations of a civilisation which, like ours, is always in a hurry? Among men, who live between the train, the motor-car, and the telephone? Every epoch directs all its efforts towards a supreme goal, which for it is the all-important one. There have been epochs ablaze with religious fervour, whose chief aspiration it was to diffuse and to defend the faith. There have been epochs with a profound sense of the ambition for glory, which fought great wars. Others again have turned their attention to the fostering of the arts and sciences. Our civilisation aims, in the first place, at the mastery over nature, and the intensive exploitation of all the riches of the earth. We enjoy the172 advantages of it. We are not inclined to abjure railways and telegraphs. We have no wish again to run the risk of famine, which was such an ever-present one to the civilisations of the past. We enjoy the incredible abundance and liberty of the day and are by no means eager to return to the pristine régime of discipline and parsimony. We Europeans also, then, must resign ourselves to paying the price which all these advantages cost, and to living in an epoch in which art cannot flourish in any high degree, in which religion will no longer have the strength to emanate waves of mystical ardour, and even science will be cultivated only so far as it can be of immediate service to practical ends, by intensifying and making more prolific the exploitation of natural riches. For this, too, is a phenomenon noticeable to-day in every part of Europe: disinterested studies are falling into disfavour. Rich as it is, the world of to-day is less capable of searching after the true for the sole pleasure of expanding the field of knowledge, than it was two centuries ago, when it was so much poorer. Even scientists nowadays want to see their discoveries turned into money.",
        "target_summary": "The modern world, as described by a character, fundamentally prioritizes quantity over quality. This reflects an eternal trade-off: achieving high quality demands sufficient time and limits output, whereas pursuing high quantity or speed inevitably compromises quality. This principle helps explain the perceived decline in art and other societal refinements, often attributed to modern civilizations. Such a decline is not an error but a necessary consequence—a compensation for the speed and abundance of our age. Rapid fortunes, swift transportation (trains, cars, aeroplanes, telegraphs), and overall efficiency come at the price of pervasive mediocrity. We cannot have both advanced infrastructure and exquisite 18th-century artistry, nor maintain elaborate traditional good manners while embracing the hurried pace that fosters a more casual cordiality.\n\nEvery historical epoch defines itself by a supreme goal; past eras focused on religious fervor, glory, or the advancement of arts and sciences. Our current civilization's primary objective is the mastery over nature and the intensive exploitation of Earth's resources. While this pursuit offers immense advantages—such as freedom from famine, technological conveniences, and unprecedented abundance—Europeans must accept the associated costs. These include a diminished capacity for art to flourish at a high level, a weakening of religion's mystical influence, and the cultivation of science almost exclusively for immediate practical applications that further resource exploitation. This shift is evident in Europe, where disinterested studies are declining, and even scientists increasingly prioritize the commercialization of discoveries over the pure pursuit of knowledge, a marked contrast to previous centuries when a poorer world was more dedicated to expanding understanding for its own sake.",

        "content": "The Americanisation of Europe, then, is a fatal phenomenon. Europe, from the moment when she aspired to great wealth and to the dominion of nature, was called upon to renounce her claim to many of the treasures of her ancient and refined culture. This was the conclusion at which I rested for a moment. And173 yet at this point, I, as a European, felt a misgiving. If matters stood thus, was not Europe fatally doomed to become even more thoroughly Americanised in the future? At the present time, the appetites and ambitions of all classes in Europe, even the most numerous, have been given free rein. Everybody, from the aristocrat of ancient lineage to the most obscure peasant, wishes to earn, spend, and accumulate as much as he can. There is no power, human or divine, which can pretend to drive back towards its historical fountainhead this immense torrent of greed and ambition. Europe, thus, is fated to become increasingly oblivious of the traditions of its ancient and disinterested culture; to struggle to imitate and compete with America in the production of great riches at greater speed. And, as America with her immense territories and smaller store of traditions is better equipped for the competition, so Europe must necessarily become ever more and more decadent in the future. The continent destined to dominate the civilisation of the future, as Europe dominated it up to the middle of the nineteenth century, will be America. There are not wanting persons in Europe who take a delight in repeating from time to time this prophecy, which to the ears of a European sounds somewhat lugubrious. For a moment, when in America, I, too, somewhat discouraged by the vitality of which the American spirit of progress gives proof, felt myself inclined to give ear to these prophets, whom hitherto174 in Europe I had always contradicted. Yes, culture in Europe was destined to become ever more decadent before the invasion of progress interpreted in the American sense; quantity, that is to say, the nations with vast territories at their disposal and capable of rapidly producing vast wealth, would rule supreme in the future, while the forces of idealism would lose a great part of their ancient empire over the world. America, however, actually America, proved to me that the ancient culture represented by Europe is not destined to die out, and that, if Europe is being Americanised, America in compensation is being induced by an eternal impulse to Europeanise herself! I, like so many other Europeans, had gone to America, persuaded that the American’s only thought is to make money. But in America, I, too, ended with the conviction that no country in Europe expends so much money, labour, and zeal on founding museums, schools, universities, and new religions; on fostering, in the midst of the mechanical civilisation and the realm of quantity, the arts, the religious spirit, and the disinterested sciences; on preventing the loss of that intellectual legacy of the past, in which Europe takes an ever-decreasing interest, occupied as she is in developing her industries and her trade. If, out of deference to history, rather than to the present day, we may grant that Europe represents in the world’s history the effort directed to the perfecting of a lofty culture, artistic, scientific, religious, or philosophic,—there is no doubt175 but that America is to-day becoming Europeanised; is seeking, that is to say, to employ the vast riches which she has accumulated by the intensive exploitation of her territory in the promotion of the progress of art, knowledge, and the religious spirit. Doubtless, not all the efforts she makes are successful; but they are numerous, intense, and obstinate. Indeed, if America is open to any reproach in this relation, it is, in my opinion, to that of feeling too ardent an admiration for lofty culture—art and science in particular—an admiration which sometimes blunts the critical sense, and does not permit her to distinguish what in the world of the ideal is authentic from what is counterfeit, the real gold from pinchbeck. In fact, one can find in no European country so lively and profound a trust in science as in America. Europe knows that science can do a great deal and has done a great deal, but that it often promises, or raises hopes of, more than it can do. Not so in America. Among the cultured, as among the lower classes, faith in the power of science is practically unlimited. There is no marvel which the American does not expect to see issuing from the scientist’s closet. Even the mystical movements in America, whose trend is anti-scientific, like to trick themselves out with the name of “Science,” which has a kind of magic sound and glamour for the men of the New World. There is the same universal enthusiasm for art in America. It might be said that America is determined to admire everything which might possibly be beautiful,176 of every country, every epoch, and every school. It is true that the most engrossing preoccupation of the Americans is not that of fostering the arts; they must still keep their minds fixed on the conquest of their great continent. But it is also true that, in the moments of leisure, when they can think of something other than business, they fling open, so to speak, their arms to the arts of the whole world. Just as all the styles of architecture can be found in the great buildings of New York, so all the arts which have flourished in the course of centuries in Asia and Europe have been transplanted into the New World. America, I might almost say, wishes to taste and understand all the beauties which the past has created; classical literature as well as contemporary European literature, Italian as well as German music, Greek sculpture as well as the French sculpture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Italian as well as Dutch painting, Japanese decorative art as well as the styles of the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth Louis. New York, from this point of view, is a real artistic cosmopolis. If, then, Europe is gradually destroying her ancient culture, and her great traditions, in order to construct railways and factories, to found banks and to initiate commercial enterprises, America, on the other hand, wishes to employ the wealth gained by the intensive exploitation of her vast continent in creating an art and a science. How can we explain this contrast? “The snobbery of a parvenue nation,” it pleases the177 European, with a shrug of the shoulders, to label it. But anyone with any knowledge of America and much knowledge of human nature will not rest content with so glib an explanation. It is true that, thanks to machinery, to America, and to the idea of liberty and progress, quantity is to-day triumphant in the world. Men wish to enjoy abundance. Can they, however, confine their wish to abundance, to the increase, that is to say, of the quantity of things they possess? Observe a peasant who comes to town, turns artisan, and earns a higher wage. What does he do? Does he buy with his higher wage a second pair of boots, or a second suit in addition to and like the one he wore when he was poor? No. He adopts the town fashions and buys more elegant shoes and clothes, in appearance at least, that is to say, like those worn by the upper classes. In every country of America and Europe, the differences in dress between the upper and lower classes, once so great, are disappearing. And why? Because the people want to dress like the “Swells”; and modern industry spares no trouble to give them at little cost the means of satisfying their ambition. In other words, the workman wants to invest his higher wage in the purchase of finer, or what he thinks are finer, clothes, than those he wore before, because to possess a suit of superior clothes is to him a greater joy than to have two suits of the same workmanship as those he wore when he was poorer. In other words, quantity soon satiates, and at a certain stage man needs to translate it into178 quality, and to employ his wealth to procure for himself, not a greater number of things, but more beautiful and better things, otherwise wealth is useless. If this need is lively and profound in the minds of the people, how much stronger must it be in the richer classes, those with great resources at their disposal! A man who possesses ten millions and another who possesses one hundred cannot eat ten and a hundred times as much respectively as the modest lord of only one million, live in a house ten or a hundred times as vast, or buy himself ten or a hundred hats where the other buys only one. If they used their wealth in that way, they would be considered mad, and with good reason. They must then strive to procure for themselves, with their superior wealth, things of superior beauty or quality, to translate their wealth into beauty and merit, quantity into quality. There are, it is true, men who desire wealth only for the pleasure of creating it, and who are indifferent to the other pleasures which it brings. At no time, perhaps, were these men so numerous as at present among the great bankers, merchants, and manufacturers who now rule the economic destinies of the modern world. But even to-day, these men, who love money as the artist loves his art, in itself and not for the pleasures which it can give, are in a minority. And so they will always be, because even if—impossible hypothesis—anybody in the upper classes developed such a fervid enthusiasm for banking, industry, and commerce, as to arrive at considering wealth only as an179 end in itself, a means of displaying his own ability, there would still be the women. Unless it be wished that even in the wealthy classes, women should engage in business and work, women will be bound always to consider wealth as an instrument for the advancement of life, procuring for its possessor joys more select and articles of superior quality.",
        "target_summary": "The author initially views the \"Americanization of Europe\" as a fatal phenomenon. He fears Europe's pursuit of wealth and dominance over nature has forced it to abandon its ancient, refined culture, leading to a future of increasing materialism and decadence. He believes Europe is destined to imitate and compete with America in rapid wealth production, but America, with its vast territories and fewer traditions, is better equipped to dominate the future, a \"lugubrious prophecy\" that initially disheartens him.\n\nHowever, after experiencing America, the author's perspective shifts dramatically. He concludes that while Europe is indeed becoming Americanized, America is simultaneously undergoing a process of \"Europeanization.\" Contrary to the stereotype of Americans solely pursuing money, he observes their extensive investment in culture: establishing museums, schools, universities, and promoting arts, religious spirit, and disinterested sciences. America is actively preserving the intellectual legacy that Europe, preoccupied with industry and trade, increasingly neglects.\n\nThe author notes America's \"ardent admiration\" for high culture, particularly art and science, sometimes bordering on uncritical enthusiasm. Faith in science is \"practically unlimited,\" and there's a universal appreciation for art, with America importing and embracing diverse styles from global history, making cities like New York artistic cosmopolises. Thus, while Europe sacrifices culture for industry, America uses its wealth to cultivate art and science.\n\nHe rejects the cynical explanation of American cultural endeavors as mere \"snobbery.\" Instead, he argues that human nature, though initially desiring \"quantity\" (abundance), quickly becomes satiated. People naturally seek to translate wealth into \"quality\"—finer, more beautiful, and better things. This drive for quality is evident even in a peasant buying more elegant clothes rather than just a second pair of old ones. For the wealthy, who cannot infinitely consume more quantity, converting wealth into superior beauty and merit becomes essential. While a minority may pursue wealth for its own sake, most, especially women, view it as a means to acquire \"select joys and articles of superior quality,\" reinforcing this fundamental human need to transform quantity into quality.",

        "content": "In fact, this and no other is the origin of snobbery. Snobbery is, I know, an obvious target for sarcasm at the present day. And it is easy to laugh at the nouveau riche who is determined at all costs, even at the price of sacrifice and snubs, to frequent houses and circles which formerly were closed to him; who is glad to go for trips in a motor-car, even if they cause him suffering, or to go to the opera even if he falls asleep there, because he thinks that by doing so, he is living up to the standard of the highest elegance. But if he were not under this delusion, what would be the use of his wealth to him? What compensation would he have for the fatigues and perils he had incurred in its acquisition? Snobbery is simply an effort to translate quantity into quality to which man is impelled by the very increase of wealth. There never was so much snobbery as there is at the present time, because there never was so much wealth. Without a doubt, modern snobbery is full of grotesque deceptions. The world never contained so many nouveaux riches, unprepared to enjoy the real refinements of life, and destined to be the victims of every180 sort of fraud. How often and in how many instances do we not see the tragi-comedy of Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, Molière’s immortal comedy, acted over again at the present day? But one can also find, in America perhaps more abundantly than in Europe, families whose wealth dates back several generations, in which families the mania for the accumulation of riches has died down, and which have time, inclination, and culture enough to employ their wealth on behalf of the most lofty activities of the mind. These are the American families who ransack Europe for works of art, who found schools and museums, who give work to architects, painters, and sculptors, who directly or indirectly stimulate an ever-increasing number of the rising generation not to concentrate on the making of money, but to devote themselves to those intellectual labours of which, till a short while ago, Europe had the monopoly. And it is the existence of this portion of American society and its tendencies that entitle us to say that America is being Europeanised. Europe, then, wishing to live a larger life, after centuries of penury and stint, is becoming Americanised, and is sacrificing a part of her splendid traditions of lofty culture to her desire to learn from America the art of producing new wealth rapidly. America, on the other hand, having accumulated immense wealth by the intensive exploitation of her territory, is becoming Europeanised; she is turning, that is to say, to the arts, sciences, and most lofty forms of higher culture, to181 perfect which Europe has laboured for centuries. Yet at this point I think I hear the reader cry: “Is not this all to the good? Does it not establish a marvellous balance between the two worlds? Does it not prove that our civilisation is the richest, most powerful, best balanced, and most perfect which has ever existed? Ought Europe to have gone on living for ever in misery, intent only on the perfecting of culture, and America to have had never a thought for anything but the multiplication of wealth?” To be sure, if this exchange of wealth and culture between the two continents could be effected as well and easily as it can be described, our epoch would be in very truth an epoch of fabulous felicity. We might claim to be, in comparison with preceding generations, a generation of supermen. Unfortunately, the difficulties are greater than they seem at first sight to be. What they are will be seen in the next chapter; we shall then see that it has become much easier to produce new wealth than to employ it in the creation of a lofty and refined civilisation; and that this is the secret torment which afflicts Europe and America.",
        "target_summary": "Snobbery originates from the increasing drive to translate material wealth (\"quantity\") into quality or social standing. Although modern snobbery is often a target for sarcasm, the author posits that for the nouveau riche, their efforts to frequent exclusive circles or engage in elegant activities (even if they involve enduring suffering on motor-car trips or falling asleep at the opera) are essential; without such delusions, their wealth and the arduous process of acquiring it would offer no meaningful compensation. The present era, marked by unparalleled wealth, consequently experiences unprecedented snobbery, leading to \"grotesque deceptions\" where many ill-prepared individuals become victims of fraud, echoing Molière’s *Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme*.\n\nHowever, America exhibits a counter-trend: multi-generational wealthy families move beyond mere accumulation, instead dedicating their time, inclination, and culture to \"lofty activities of the mind.\" These families found schools and museums, support artists, and inspire younger generations to pursue intellectual endeavors, a domain once monopolized by Europe. This development signals America's \"Europeanisation.\" Conversely, Europe, seeking a more prosperous \"larger life\" after centuries of scarcity, is \"Americanised,\" as it sacrifices some of its \"splendid traditions of lofty culture\" to adopt America's methods of rapid wealth creation.\n\nWhile this exchange of wealth and culture between continents might seem to establish a \"marvellous balance\" and suggest the advent of a perfect civilization, the author cautions that such an optimistic outcome is overly simplistic. The true, and significantly harder, challenge—the \"secret torment\" afflicting both Europe and America—lies not in the production of new wealth, but in effectively employing it to create a genuinely lofty and refined civilization.",

        "content": "The bewildering growth in the wealth of America has affected in many different ways the whole world. Economists are studying its effects with much zeal. One, and not the least curious, of them, is the rise in the value of antiques. From Etruscan ceramics to French furniture of the eighteenth century, from Greek statues to Italian pictures of every epoch, from Tanagra statuettes to the lace, embroideries, tapestries, manuscripts, glass, and filigree from every part of the world, all the artistic furniture of Europe, Asia, and Africa which has survived the ravages of time has trebled and quadrupled its value. Few financial speculations proved more successful in Europe than the collection about fifty years ago of antiques. Many instances could be quoted to prove this. Everybody, even in America, I suppose, has heard recently of the great Paris tailor who set to work thirty years ago to collect statues, pictures, and French objets d’art of the eighteenth century. He spent about three millions on his collection; and he put it up for auction183 last year and cleared fourteen millions! An occurrence which made less noise, because it was on a smaller scale, but analogous to the foregoing, is the following: A journalist, a man of taste and a great admirer of beautiful antiques, came to Rome. Everybody called him a maniac, because, though he had a family, he spent all his savings in buying from the small antique dealers and in the Campo di Fiori lamps, books, stuffs, and every other bit of antique he could lay hands on. Well, he died ten years ago, and left his family nothing but a houseful of fine antiques. The family, which did not share his mania, sold them, and realised a fortune, the income of which was, and is, enough to support them in comfort. If the journalist had been discreet and had invested his savings in shares and bonds, probably his family would now be living in a very much humbler way. It is unnecessary to quote further evidence in support of so notorious a fact. Ask any European antiquarian the reason for this appreciation, and he will reply unhesitatingly, “America.” America for the last thirty years has been making assaults on the antiquities-market with all the tenacity of her untiring activity, and the might of her new-made wealth. Some people in Europe—those who have antiques to sell—are very glad that it should be so. Others lament, complaining that Europe is emptying herself of her treasures in favour of the New World. Most people, however, smile at what they consider a proof of the incurable184 snobbery of the New World. Europe is very ready to accuse America of loving antiques only because they are rare and, therefore, dear; of fighting dollar-duels about them, only to prove their own wealth, without any power of judging and distinguishing between the good and the bad, though even among antiques there are ugly as well as beautiful ones, representing comparative grades of beauty. And this accusation too is, in its general application, unjust and unsubstantial. Anybody who has had any extensive dealings with the wealthy houses of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, and Chicago, knows that they contain many Americans who are competent judges and buyers of artistic antiques. It is true that, from this point of view, the big American houses cannot yet challenge comparison with the big European houses. Nevertheless, numberless are the marvellous ceramics from the Far East, numberless the magnificent pieces of French eighteenth century furniture, numberless the pieces of wonderful lace, glass, and antique boiseries which it has been my good fortune to see, not without an occasional pang, in America. On the other hand, this reproach, which, couched in its usual form, is unjust, contains a modicum of truth, which however applies to Europe as well as to America. I have often had occasion to notice in wealthy modern houses—in Europe as well as in America, but in America more than in Europe—that they are adorned with many extremely beautiful old pieces, but that185 these are too numerous, and too heterogeneous. You find in a modern drawing-room material of every epoch and from all parts of the world; from ancient Greece, and from China of the last century, from the Italian Middle Ages and from contemporary Persia. Consequently modern houses are too much like small museums, in which numbers of wonderful little antiques, picked up wherever they were to be had, are exposed to view, and in which the modern furniture and adornments serve as the show-case in which the antiques are displayed, instead of being, as they were in the eighteenth century, the principal decoration, of which some beautiful antique was the appropriate ornament and complement. This inversion of the natural order of things would be inexplicable, were we not all of us persuaded more or less consciously that old things must necessarily be more beautiful than modern ones. For this reason we are willing that what we make, the modern, shall be subordinated and serve as a tool to the antique. In short, the antique, in Europe as in America, has acquired nowadays a value of its own in art, merely on the score of its antiquity. I need not dwell on the strangeness of this prejudice in favour of antiques in an age and in countries in which, directly one leaves the field of art behind, one finds so keen a craze for the modern. Not to be up-to-date is at the present day the greatest reproach we can fling at a man in Europe and in America, especially in America. Why then does186 modernity in art arouse, not only in old Europe, but also, and perhaps more, in young America, so much diffidence and mistrust? Why do we, notwithstanding the attempts which modern artists make to emulate the ancients or to create new things, turn to the past when we want to possess or enjoy something really beautiful? May this contradiction be the effort of a last surviving prejudice? For centuries, man was educated to consider all antique things, only because they were antique, preferable to modern ones. In many respects, we have conquered this venerable prejudice. May our attachment to the antique in art be the last and most persistent survival of this sentiment, itself destined to disappear? No. This persistent attachment to the antique in art is not prejudice; it is the effect of the incurable artistic weakness of our epoch. Men are following a profound and sure instinct when, in their desire for beauty, they turn to the antique; for art is as it were the lost Paradise of our civilisation, whose atmosphere we are always breathing, but to which the entrance is forbidden us. It is a phenomenon of contemporary life which usually attracts but little attention; and yet how strange it is! The need for the adornment of life with beautiful things—for translating quantity into quality, as I said above—has not diminished among the wealthy classes, and could not diminish, because it is a profoundly human need. The world’s upper classes never had so much wealth at their disposal as now, and187 never had so keen a desire to spend a considerable part of it in the purchase of beautiful things. How many artistic masterpieces could have been paid for, and how many painters, sculptors, and architects of genius liberally rewarded with half the sums which have been spent in raising fourfold or sixfold the value of the antiquities of Europe, Asia, and Africa? Indeed the immense growth in the world’s wealth has profited the dead, not the living, in the world of art, antiquities and not the modern arts. And it was inevitable that this should be so. Why? Because modern times are not adapted to be a golden age of art, for a psychological and moral reason, which, however, is not to be sought in the practical and commercial spirit of modern times. Many of the fairest palaces and pictures which we admire in Italy were commissioned by merchants who were no less practical than modern bankers. The reason is to be sought elsewhere, and it is more profound. Modern civilisation has conquered with its railways, telegraphs, and steam-boats, the whole earth. In fifty years, it has succeeded in conquering continents so vast as North America. It has created riches so fabulous, in a word, it has achieved so much power, because it has broken through all the limits within which the spirit of tradition confined past generations. Escaping from these limits, it has learned to create at great speed. Speed and the tireless spirit of innovation are the two formidable weapons which have given our civilisation the victory in her188 struggle with nature and with the other more conservative and more deliberate civilisations. But the qualities necessary to artistic excellence are just the two opposite qualities: the spirit of tradition and laborious deliberateness.",
        "target_summary": "The immense growth of American wealth has significantly driven up the value of antiques globally, from Etruscan ceramics to 18th-century French furniture, often tripling or quadrupling their worth. This made antique collecting a highly successful financial speculation in Europe, exemplified by a Paris tailor who turned a three-million-franc investment into fourteen million, and a Roman journalist whose antique collection provided for his family after his death. European antiquarians unequivocally attribute this appreciation to America's tenacious activity and purchasing power over the past thirty years.\n\nEuropean reactions vary: some sellers are pleased, others lament the perceived emptying of European treasures into the New World, and many dismiss it as American snobbery, accusing Americans of valuing antiques only for their rarity and cost, without true discernment. The author refutes this general accusation, acknowledging many wealthy Americans are competent art judges. However, he notes a \"modicum of truth\": wealthy modern houses, particularly in America, often display an overwhelming and heterogeneous collection of antiques from diverse epochs and regions. This creates spaces resembling small museums, where modern furnishings merely serve as showcases, inverting the traditional role where beautiful antiques complemented principal decorations.\n\nThis phenomenon implies a subconscious belief that old things are inherently more beautiful than modern ones, even as contemporary society in other fields prizes modernity and being \"up-to-date.\" The author questions why art uniquely elicits such diffidence towards the modern. He concludes that this persistent attachment to antique art is not mere prejudice, but rather the \"incurable artistic weakness of our epoch.\" Consequently, the era's vast wealth benefits dead artists and antiquities, not living artists or modern art. This outcome is inevitable because modern civilization, which achieved unprecedented power through speed and innovation (e.g., railways, telegraphs) by breaking from tradition, possesses qualities directly opposite to the spirit of tradition and laborious deliberateness essential for artistic excellence.",

        "content": "We moderns, victims of the giddy pace at which we live, may be somewhat oblivious of the fact; but it is a fact that anyone who knows history cannot ignore. To create and foster an art really worthy of the name,—Greek sculpture, Italian painting, the French decorative art of the eighteenth century,—the immense sums at our disposal are useless, and the sciences of steam and electricity of no avail. I have already had occasion to prove this in the preceding chapters. The nations and the generations which have created the most famous arts and whose relics are still our delight, were poor and ignorant compared with us. In order to create and foster art, it is necessary to educate generations of artists to do good work and generations of amateurs to understand and appreciate it. Neither the artists nor the public taste can be educated without a spirit of tradition and of æsthetic discipline, which induces the public to allow the artists the time necessary for the perfecting of their respective arts in all their details; which induces the artist to recognise the legitimate requirements of the public for which he works, and to seek to satisfy it by adapting his own work to those requirements. Anyone can see, however, that nowadays these two189 conditions have become well-nigh impossible. In the gigantic confusion of the modern world, races, cultures, and populations are continually intermingling. Generations follow each other with the fixed determination not to continue what their immediate predecessor has done but to do something different. Ancient traditions are dying out, and no new ones are being formed or can be formed. Change is the order of the day. Sons but rarely adopt their father’s professions, and not a few die in lands other than those in which they were born. Modern society is agitated by a continual process of renewal, which is the deep-seated source of her energy and activity, but is also a reason for her artistic decadence. In this continual mobility of bodies, wills, and ideas; in this perpetual change of tendencies, tastes, and standards, art is losing her bearings and, alone in this age of bold enterprises, is becoming greedy and diffident. Public and artists, instead of helping each other, have grown timid. The public no longer does what it likes. It no longer has any standard of judgment. It has become timid and diffident. It is obsessed by the fear of mistaking a masterpiece for a deception or a deception for a masterpiece. This uncertainty of tastes and desires in the public in its turn bewilders the artists. When the painter, the sculptor, the musician, and the poet try to find in the desires and inclinations of the public the sure indication which in times past used to be the support and guidance of artists in their creations,190 they find that the public is ready to admire anything, but has no marked preference for anything in particular. The artist is free, but his liberty is a liberty which embarrasses and paralyses him. Under these circumstances, the adroit artists quickly learn the art of exploiting the uncertainties and inexperiences of the public, and win riches and honours. The crazy and the charlatans seek to intimidate the public by perpetrating novelties of extravagant audacity. Serious and conscientious artists there are nowadays, of course, but everyone has new formulæ of his own art, differing from those of everyone else, and proclaims his to be the only true, fruitful, and admirable formulæ, at the same time denouncing all others as freaks. By what standard are we to judge these quarrels? Bewildered by so many different attempts and judgments, the public ends by turning to the antique. It has a vague idea that the past ages may have been inferior to our own in all other respects, but in art were superior to it. It knows that a work of art at least one century old may be more or less beautiful, but that it is at least a serious work of art, conceived and carried out in good faith, not for the mystification of an ingenuous public by some daring theory of novelty. So the Europeans are wrong in ridiculing the passion of the Americans for ancient things. This passion has the same origin on the other side of the Atlantic as it has on this. In art, our civilisation is destined to remain inferior to ancient civilisations, which it has191 overshadowed with its wisdom, its power, and its wealth. This is the reason for the rapid growth in the value of the antique in art, even in the age of modernity à outrance. We need feel no shame in avowing it openly. Civilisations and epochs, like individuals, cannot have and expect everything; and the share which has fallen to us of the good things of the earth is so large, that we can readily console ourselves for the loss of this particular one. Who reasoned thus would reason wisely. Nevertheless, the fact is of greater importance than it appears. It shows that the balance between the ancient culture of Europe and the spirit of American culture—that balance which might perhaps have produced the most brilliant civilisation in history—will never be perfectly secured, at least so long as the conditions of the world remain what they now are. America will be able to continue her Europeanisation, and Europe her Americanisation, as we have seen is the case. But this interchange of influences will not have as its only result the increase of the wealth of Europe and of the culture of America. It will give birth in the two worlds to a discontent and an unrest which nothing will be able to allay. In fact, the more its upper classes come under the influence of the culture of the Old World, the more ardent will become the admiration and desire of America for the antique,—for that beauty which the civilisations preceding our own created with such192 wealth and perfection of forms; the more strongly will it be convinced of our artistic inferiority, and persuaded that one of the treasures of life we have lost irreparably, and can only enjoy in the relics of other generations. Every picture or statue or artistic object which crosses the ocean and enters America, every museum which a rich Maecenas opens in the New World to the public or which a city or a state creates, every chair founded, and every book of artistic history printed,—everything, in fact, which brings the spirit of America into contact with the masterpieces of ancient European art, and awakens recognition and admiration for them, makes America at the same time recognise how comparatively decadent is that which our times produce; reveals to it that lost Paradise of Beauty around whose closed gates we are now condemned to hover. This contact with the artistic achievement of the past becomes, therefore, at the same time a gadfly of discontent and unrest to the upper and cultured classes. By an inverse process, the further the spirit of American progress penetrates into Europe, the more completely does it detach the Old World from its past, and, therefore, irritates, grieves, and disgusts the classes which have enough culture to recognise and admire the marvellous arts of that past. With every ten years that elapse, we feel that our past, with all its radiant glories, has receded a hundred years; that we are plunging into a new world, in which riches, knowledge, and our power over nature will increase, but which will193 be ugly, inharmonious, and vulgar compared with the centuries which preceded it. Many Americans fail to understand why Europe cherishes so many latent antipathies to America, which has never done her any harm, directly at least. The real reason for these antipathies must be looked for in the artistic decadence which accompanies the development of modern civilisation. That civilisation has not been created by America alone, but by America and Europe combined. Europe and America, therefore, share the responsibility for this decadence. Yet it suits the European book from time to time to see in America the symbol of the civilisation of railways, steam, electricity, business, and industry on a large scale; and Europeans gladly vent on America their spleen for whatever in this civilisation, pregnant with good and with evil, offends them and arouses regret. In short, there is an insoluble contradiction between progress, as our age understands the word,—between the “American” progress, as many Europeans call it,—and art. This contradiction has as yet attracted but little notice, in the still great confusion in which we live, in the initial tumult of this new civilisation which is invading the earth. It will be noticed, however, more and more strongly, as generation succeeds generation, and in many families the primary hunger for wealth is satiated and gives way to the desire to “translate quantity into quality”: as American love for the historical beauties of the Old World increases, and194 Europe takes further lessons in the multiplication of her wealth. There is no escape or salvation for our civilisation from the discontent and unrest which will arise from this contradiction. It is a torment which will grow with the growth of wealth and culture; which nations and classes will feel more acutely the richer and the more cultivated they become; from which perhaps, one day, America will suffer more severely than many European nations; which will oppress the upper classes much more heavily than the people. The latter, indeed, will not feel it at all, and will alone be able to live in modern civilisation, as contented as man ever can be in this world.",
        "target_summary": "Modern society, despite its immense wealth and scientific advancements, struggles to produce art truly worthy of comparison to past eras like Greek sculpture or Italian painting. This is because great art necessitates educating generations of artists and a discerning public within a spirit of tradition and aesthetic discipline. This environment allows artists the time to perfect their craft and encourages a mutual understanding between artist and public regarding aesthetic requirements.\n\nHowever, these crucial conditions are unattainable in the modern world. Constant change, intermingling cultures, and the rejection of ancient traditions in favor of novelty define our age. This perpetual renewal, while a source of energy, simultaneously causes artistic decadence. Art loses its direction amidst shifting tastes, and the public, lacking clear standards, becomes timid and fearful of misjudging art. Artists, consequently, are either paralyzed by this uncertainty, or they exploit public inexperience for profit, or they create isolated, often conflicting, artistic \"formulæ.\"\n\nBewildered, the public turns to antique art, instinctively recognizing its serious intent and good faith compared to many modern creations. This explains the rising value placed on historical art, signifying modern civilization's artistic inferiority despite its wisdom, power, and wealth in other domains. While it's logical to accept this artistic loss given our other gains, this decadence prevents a potentially brilliant balance between European and American cultures.\n\nThe ongoing cultural exchange between Europe and America, rather than solely increasing wealth or culture, will inevitably breed discontent. As America absorbs Old World culture, its admiration for antique beauty will intensify, underscoring its own artistic deficiencies and revealing a \"lost Paradise of Beauty.\" Conversely, the spread of American progress in Europe will further detach it from its artistic past, frustrating and grieving cultured Europeans who foresee a future that, while rich and powerful, will be ugly and inharmonious.\n\nThis artistic decline, a shared outcome of both European and American modern civilization, is a root cause of Europe's latent antipathy towards America, often seen as the symbol of rapid, industrial progress. An underlying contradiction exists between \"American\" progress—focused on wealth and industry—and art. This contradiction, currently overlooked amidst the tumult of modern civilization, will become increasingly apparent with each generation. It will lead to inescapable discontent and unrest, felt most acutely by the wealthy and cultured classes who are sensitive to artistic quality, while the less cultured populace may remain largely unaffected and content within modern society.",

        "content": "History often has strange surprises in store. The civilisation of machinery tended at its birth to appear as a death-blow to the working classes, a godsend to the upper classes. For years and years, socialism, generalising from the initial rubs, predicted and pretended to prove that the great mechanical industry must enrich a small oligarchy inordinately, and reduce to the blackest wretchedness the great mass of the population; that a new feudalism of capitalists, fiercer than the barons of the Middle Ages, would seize all the good things of the world. A century passes, and we find this civilisation giving complete satisfaction only to the workmen, because it can content the workmen only from the double point of view of quantity and quality. It gives them an abundance which only a small fraction of the people enjoyed up to a century ago; and, at195 the same time, bestows on them a luxury which fully satisfies their yet simple and unsophisticated æsthetic sense. We may smile when we see in a workman’s home mirrors and clocks which are the rudest imitations of masterpieces of the Louis XV and Louis XVI styles, hideous reproductions from a German factory; and coarse carpets which are poor European copies of beautiful Turkish and Persian models, the result of the substitution of the iron teeth of a machine for the industrious fingers of the human hand, and of decadent aniline dyes for the brilliant and unfading vegetable colours. The workman, however, does not know the matchless models of which these objects are the ugly copies, and, inasmuch as every æsthetic verdict arises out of a comparison, these reproductions represent for him the summit of perfection, and entirely satisfy his need for beautiful things round about him. To the upper classes, on the other hand, this civilisation has given immense and imposing wealth, such as no epoch had ever considered possible; but it has deprived them of the means of enjoying it. Wealth becomes nowadays more useless, the greater it becomes, because a multi-millionaire cannot build himself a house, wear clothes, or buy objects a hundred times finer and better than the possessor of only a few millions. We no longer have artists capable of accomplishing miracles. The men of great wealth are forced to compete with each other for the relics of past beauty at fabulous prices, when they are not inclined to spend all their196 wealth for the benefit of others. These relics are not sufficient, however, to satisfy the desire for beauty and art which grows in our times with the growth of wealth and of culture. On the contrary, they only make us feel more acutely the decadent vulgarity of everything, with but few exceptions, which our age produces.",
        "target_summary": "Machine civilization, initially perceived as a threat to the working classes and a boon to the upper echelons, defied early socialist predictions of widespread wretchedness and a new capitalist feudalism. A century later, it primarily satisfied the working class by providing an abundance and luxury previously enjoyed by only a small fraction of the population. Although their possessions—like crude imitations of historical styles—might seem unrefined, these objects fully satisfied the workmen's simple aesthetic sense, as they were unaware of the original masterpieces.\n\nConversely, while this civilization bestowed immense and unprecedented wealth upon the upper classes, it simultaneously deprived them of the means to truly enjoy it. Great wealth became increasingly useless; a multi-millionaire could not acquire goods proportionately finer than someone with fewer millions because artists capable of creating such unique wonders were absent. The wealthy were thus forced to compete for scarce relics of past beauty, which were insufficient to meet their growing desire for art and culture, only serving to highlight the \"decadent vulgarity\" of nearly all contemporary productions.",

        "content": "york, August 12, 1888.—All summer long the sorrowful skies have been weeping over England, and my first prospect of this ancient city was a prospect through drizzle and mist. Yet even so it was impressive. York is one of the quaintest cities in the kingdom. Many of the streets are narrow and crooked. Most of the buildings are of low stature, built of brick, and roofed with red tiles. Here and there you find a house of Queen Elizabeth's time, picturesque with overhanging timber-crossed fronts and peaked gables. One such house, in Stonegate, is conspicuously marked with its date, 1574. Another, in College street, enclosing a quadrangular court and lovely with old timber and carved gateway, was built by the Neville family in 1460. There is a wide area in the centre of the town called Parliament street, where the market is opened, by torchlight, on certain evenings of every week. It was market-time last evening, and, wandering through the motley and merry crowd that filled the square, about nine o'clock, I[54] bought, at a flower-stall, the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster,—twining them together as an emblem of the settled peace that here broods so sweetly over the venerable relics of a wild and stormy past. Four sections of the old wall of York are still extant and the observer is amused to perceive the ingenuity with which those gray and mouldering remnants of the feudal age are blended into the structures of the democratic present. From Bootham to Monk Gate,—so named in honour of General Monk, at the Restoration,—a distance of about half a mile, the wall is absorbed by the adjacent buildings. But you may walk upon it from Monk Gate to Jewbury, about a quarter of a mile, and afterward, crossing the Foss, you may find it again on the southeast of the city, and walk upon it[55] from Red Tower to old Fishergate, descending near York Castle. There are houses both within the walls and without. The walk is about eight feet wide, protected on one hand by a fretted battlement and on the other by an occasional bit of iron fence. The base of the wall, for a considerable part of its extent, is fringed with market gardens or with grassy banks. In one of its towers there is a gate-house, still occupied as a dwelling; and a comfortable dwelling no doubt it is. In another, of which nothing now remains but the walls, four large trees are rooted; and, as they are already tall enough to wave their leafy tops above the battlement, they must have been growing there for at least twenty years. At one point the Great Northern Railway enters through an arch in the ancient wall, and as you look down from the battlements your gaze rests upon long lines of rail and a spacious station, together with its adjacent hotel,—objects which consort but strangely with what your fancy knows of York; a city of donjons and barbicans, the moat, the draw-bridge, the portcullis, the citadel, the man-at-arms, and the knight in armour, with the banners of William the Norman flowing over all. The river Ouse divides the city of York, which lies mostly upon its east bank, and in order to reach the longest and most attractive portion of the wall that is now available to the pedestrian you must cross the Ouse, either at Skeldergate or Lendal, paying a half-penny as toll, both when you go and when you return. The walk here is three-quarters of a mile long, and from an angle of this wall, just above the railway arch, may be obtained the best view of the mighty cathedral,—one[56] of the most stupendous and sublime works that ever were erected by the inspired brain and loving labour of man. While I walked there last night, and mused upon the story of the Wars of the Roses, and strove to conjure up the pageants and the horrors that must have been presented, all about this region, in that remote and turbulent past, the glorious bells of the minster were chiming from its towers, while the fresh evening breeze, sweet with the fragrance of wet flowers and foliage, seemed to flood this ancient, venerable city with the golden music of a celestial benediction.",

        "content": "What a comfort their souls must find in such an edifice as York minster! What a solace and what an inspiration! There it stands, dark and lonely to-night, but symbolising, as no other object upon earth can ever do, except one of its own great kindred, God's promise[63] of immortal life to man, and man's unquenchable faith in the promise of God. Dark and lonely now, but during many hours of its daily and nightly life sentient, eloquent, vital, participating in all the thought, conduct, and experience of those who dwell around it. The beautiful peal of its bells that I heard last night was for Canon Baillie, one of the oldest and most beloved and venerated of its clergy. This morning, sitting in its choir, I heard the tender, thoughtful eulogy so simply and sweetly spoken by the aged Dean, and once again learned the essential lesson that an old age of grace, patience, and benignity means a pure heart, an unselfish spirit, and a good life passed in the service of others. This afternoon I had a place among the worshippers that thronged the nave to hear the special anthem chanted for the deceased Canon; and, as the organ pealed forth its mellow thunder, and the rich tones of the choristers swelled and rose and broke in golden waves of melody upon the groined arches and vaulted roof, my soul seemed borne away to a peace and rest that are not of this world. To-night the rising moon as she gleams through drifting clouds, will pour her silver rays upon that great east window,—at once the largest and the most beautiful in existence,—and all the Bible stories told there in such exquisite hues and forms will glow with heavenly lustre on the dark vista of chancel and nave. And when the morning comes the first beams of the rising sun will stream through the great casement and illumine the figures of saints and archbishops, and gild the old tattered battle-flags in the chancel aisle, and touch with blessing the marble effigies of the dead; and we who walk there, refreshed[64] and comforted, shall feel that the vast cathedral is indeed the gateway to heaven. York minster is the loftiest of all the English cathedrals, and the third in length,[11]—both St. Albans and Winchester being longer. The present structure is six hundred years old, and more than two hundred years were occupied in the building of it. They show you, in the crypt, some fine remains of the Norman church that preceded it upon the same site, together with traces of the still older Saxon church that preceded the Norman. The first one was of wood and was totally destroyed. The Saxon remains are a fragment of stone staircase and a piece of wall built in the ancient herring-bone fashion. The Norman remains are four clustered columns, embellished in the zigzag style. There is not much of commemorative statuary at York minster, and what there is of it was placed chiefly in the chancel. Archbishop Richard Scrope, who figures in Shakespeare's historical play of Henry the Fourth, and who was beheaded for treason in 1405, was buried in the lady chapel. Laurence Sterne's grandfather, who was chaplain to Laud, is represented there, in his ecclesiastical dress, reclining upon a couch and supporting his mitred head upon his hand,—a squat figure uncomfortably posed, but sculptured with delicate skill. Many historic names occur in the inscriptions,—Wentworth, Finch, Fenwick, Carlisle, and Heneage,—and in the north aisle of the chancel is the tomb of William of Hatfield, second son of Edward the Third, who died in[65] 1343-44, in the eighth year of his age. An alabaster statue of the royal boy reclines upon his tomb. In the cathedral library, which contains eight thousand volumes and is kept at the Deanery, is the Princess Elizabeth's prayer-book, containing her autograph. In one of the chapels is the original throne-chair of Edward the Third. In St. Leonard's Place still stands the York theatre, erected by Tate Wilkinson in 1765. In York Castle Eugene Aram was imprisoned and suffered death. The poet and bishop Beilby Porteus, the sculptor Flaxman, the grammarian Lindley Murray, and the fanatic Guy Fawkes were natives of York, and have often walked its streets. Standing on Skeldergate bridge, few readers of English fiction could fail to recall that exquisite description of the place, in the novel of No Name. In his artistic use of weather, atmosphere, and colour Wilkie Collins is always remarkable equally for his fidelity to nature and fact, and for the felicity and beauty of his language. His portrayal of York seems more than ever a gem of literary art, when you have seen the veritable spot of poor Magdalen's meeting with Captain Wragge. The name of Wragge is on one of the signboards in the city. The river, on which I did not omit to take a boat, was picturesque, with its many quaint barges, bearing masts and sails and embellished with touches of green and crimson and blue. There is no end to the associations and suggestions of the storied city. But lest my readers weary of them, let me respect the admonition of the midnight bell, and seek repose beneath the hospitable wing of the old Black Swan in Coney street, whence I send this humble memorial of ancient York.",

Inside, commemorative statuary includes the tomb of Archbishop Richard Scrope, a skilfully sculpted figure of Laurence Sterne's grandfather, and the alabaster effigy of William of Hatfield, son of Edward III. The cathedral library houses Princess Elizabeth's prayer-book, and Edward III's original throne-chair is preserved in one of the chapels.\n\nBeyond the Minster, the city of York itself is rich in history and literary connections. It boasts the historic York theatre, York Castle (where Eugene Aram was imprisoned), and is the birthplace of notable figures like Guy Fawkes. The city also served as a vivid setting for Wilkie Collins' novel \"No Name,\" with its picturesque river and unique barges. The author concludes by reflecting on the city's vast historical associations before retiring for the night.",
