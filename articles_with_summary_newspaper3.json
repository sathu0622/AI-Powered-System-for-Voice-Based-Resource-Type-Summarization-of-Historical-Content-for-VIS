The 306th Bombardment Group Museum, a former ammunition storage building, in Thurleigh, Bedfordshire, was opened in 2002. Sam Stants, a volunteer, said it houses artefacts and belongings of the group \"to keep the memories of those that served\" from 1942 to 1945. He said the building needed new front doors, new fascias and guttering repairs - and the heating system required an overhaul. The 306th Bombardment Group Museum The museum was opened on 27 July 2002 Mr Stants said the building was constructed in the \"early 1940s, in the middle of World War Two\". \"It's on an old airfield, which is open to the elements, and over the past few years with all the wet weather we've had, we've stated to notice things that need upgrading and repairing,\" he said. He aded that it was hoping to raise  2,500, and had already reached  1,100, which was \"phenomenal\". It is based at Bedford Autodrome, the former home of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) Bedford. Mr Stants said families of the veterans regularly came over to visit from the United States. \"We want to give them a place that they know, that they can retrace their families footsteps and were we are there to support that,\" he said. He added that the repairs would \"keep it going and keep the memories of those that served there\". The 306th Bombardment Group Museum The museum is currently closed and is set to reopen in May The 306th Bombardment group arrived from the Wendover Airfield in Utah, USA, in September 1942 and went on to lead the first USAAF daylight bomb raid over Germany on 27 January. It completed 341 combat missions, the second highest flown in the Eighth Air Force and the first bomb group in the Eighth Army to complete 300 missions. At its height, the airbase was home to about 3,000 personnel. Mr Stants said their presence would have created a \"large long-lasting impact on Thurleigh and this area of [north] Bedfordshire, it's really important that we can spread the message of what happened there\". Sue Parry Nine members of the 306th Bombardment Group were killed on 26 April 1944 after they left the base On 26 April, 1944, nine members of the 306th Bombardment Group were killed shortly after they took off from the airfield. After experiencing an engine fire, the plane came down in nearby Bletsoe. Only the tail gunner, George Littlefield, survived.

Europe is in flux. The powerful nations we know today - like Norman-ruled England and the fragmented territories that will go on to become France - do not yet exist. Towering Gothic cathedrals have yet to rise. Aside from the distant and prosperous city of Constantinople, few great urban centres dominate the landscape. Yet that year, on the other side of the globe, an emperor from southern India was preparing to build the world's most colossal temple. Completed just 10 years later, it was 216ft (66m) tall, assembled from 130,000 tonnes of granite: second only to Egypt's pyramids in height. At its heart was a 12ft tall emblem of the Hindu god Shiva, sheathed in gold encrusted with rubies and pearls. In its lamplit hall were 60 bronze sculptures, adorned with thousands of pearls gathered from the conquered island of Lanka. In its treasuries were several tonnes of gold and silver coins, as well as necklaces, jewels, trumpets and drums torn from defeated kings across India's southern peninsula, making the emperor the richest man of the era. He was called Raja-Raja, King of Kings, and he belonged to one of the most astonishing dynasties of the medieval world: the Cholas. His family transformed how the medieval world worked - yet they are largely unknown outside India. Getty Images Nataraja, today a symbol of Hinduism, was originally a symbol of the Chola dynasty in medieval India Prior to the 11th Century, the Cholas had been one of the many squabbling powers that dotted the Kaveri floodplain, the great body of silt that flows through India's present-day state of Tamil Nadu. But what set the Cholas apart was their endless capacity for innovation. By the standards of the medieval world, Chola queens were also remarkably prominent, serving as the dynasty's public face. Travelling to Tamil villages and rebuilding small, old mud-brick shrines in gleaming stone, the Chola dowager Sembiyan Mahadevi   Rajaraja's great-aunt   effectively \"rebranded\" the family as the foremost devotees of Shiva, winning them a popular following. Sembiyan prayed to Nataraja, a hitherto little-known form of Hindu god Shiva as the King of Dance, and all her temples featured him prominently. The trend caught on. Today, Nataraja is one of the most recognisable symbols of Hinduism. But to the medieval Indian mind, Nataraja was really a symbol of the Cholas. The emperor, Rajaraja Chola, shared his great-aunt's taste for public relations and devotion - with one significant difference. Rajaraja was also a conqueror. In the 990s, he led his armies over the Western Ghats, the range of hills that shelter India's west coast, and burned the ships of his enemies while they were at port. Next, exploiting internal turmoil on the island of Lanka, he established a Chola outpost there, becoming the first mainland Indian king to set up a lasting presence on the island. At last, he broke into the rugged Deccan Plateau - the Germany to the Tamil coast's Italy - and seized a portion of it for himself. Getty Images The ruins of a small fort built by the Chola dynasty in Tamil Nadu The loot of conquest was lavished on his great imperial temple, known today as the Brihadishvara. In addition to its precious treasures, the great temple received 5,000 tonnes of rice annually, from conquered territory across southern India (you'd need a fleet of twelve Airbus A380s to carry that much rice today). This allowed the Brihadishvara to function as a mega-ministry of public works and welfare, an instrument of the Chola state, intended to channel Rajaraja's vast fortunes into new irrigation systems, expanding cultivation, and vast new herds of sheep and buffalo. Few states in the world could have conceived of economic control at such scale and depth. The Cholas were as important to the Indian Ocean as the Mongols were to inner Eurasia. Rajaraja Chola's successor, Rajendra, built alliances with Tamil merchant corporations: a partnership between traders and government power that foreshadowed the East India Company - a powerful British trading corporation that later ruled large parts of India - that was to come more than 700 years later. In 1026, Rajendra put his troops on merchants' ships and sacked Kedah, a Malay city that dominated the global trade in precious woods and spices. While some Indian nationalists have proclaimed this to be a Chola \"conquest\" or \"colonisation\" in Southeast Asia, archaeology suggests a stranger picture: the Cholas didn't seem to have a navy of their own, but under them, a wave of Tamil diaspora merchants spread across the Bay of Bengal. By the late 11th Century, these merchants ran independent ports in northern Sumatra. A century later, they were deep in present-day Myanmar and Thailand, and worked as tax collectors in Java. AFP The Brihadishvara is one of the grandest Indian temples In the 13th Century, in Mongol-ruled China under the descendants of Kublai Khan, Tamil merchants ran successful businesses in the port of Quanzhou, and even erected a temple to Shiva on the coast of the East China Sea. It was no coincidence that, under the British Raj in the 19th Century, Tamils made up the largest chunk of Indian administrators and workers in Southeast Asia. Conquests and global connections made Chola-ruled south India a cultural and economic behemoth, the nexus of planetary trade networks. Chola aristocrats invested war-loot into a wave of new temples, which sourced fine goods from a truly global economy linking the farthest shores of Europe and Asia. Copper and tin for their bronzes came from Egypt, perhaps even Spain. Camphor and sandalwood for the gods were sourced from Sumatra and Borneo. Tamil temples grew into vast complexes and public spaces, surrounded by markets and endowed with rice estates. In the Chola capital region on the Kaveri, corresponding to the present-day city of Kumbakonam, a constellation of a dozen temple-towns supported populations of tens of thousands, possibly outclassing most cities in Europe at the time. These Chola cities were astonishingly multicultural and multireligious: Chinese Buddhists rubbed shoulders with Tunisian Jews, Bengali tantric masters traded with Lankan Muslims. Today, the state of Tamil Nadu is one of India's most urbanised. Many of the state's towns grew around Chola-period shrines and markets.

The feature-length programme on Channel 4 will chart the  27.5m restoration of Norwich Castle's medieval keep. It has been narrated by Norfolk's Sir Stephen Fry and will focus on the work of project curator Dr Tim Pestell, alongside those involved in the design and construction of the medieval palace. The main part of the castle - the keep - should reopen in the spring, with the documentary to be screened afterwards on a date to be confirmed. Shaun Whitmore/BBC Dr Tim Pestell will feature in the documentary as he works alongside architects, engineers and builders Norwich Castle was originally built under William the Conqueror and completed by King Henry I in 1121. The Royal Palace Reborn project started in summer 2020, but has suffered expensive delays, caused by the pandemic and the challenges obtaining steel due to the war in Ukraine. The discovery of hidden Norman and Victorian features, plus the need to replace a leaking roof, meant the project missed its original target of opening last summer. It was initially expected the work would cost  20m, with  13m coming from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. Norfolk County Council has had to spend an additional  4.7m on top of earlier boosts to the budget. Shaun Whitmore/BBC The castle will fully reopen to visitors in the spring The show has been made by the award-winning Eye Film, based in Norwich. Managing director Charlie Gauvain said: \"We've been documenting this incredible journey for over eight years and I'm thrilled Channel 4 will bring our film to a national audience. \"We're honoured Sir Stephen Fry will lend his hugely recognisable voice to the documentary. \"The work undertaken by the project team has been monumental and it's a privilege to share their efforts. \"My hope is this film will help put Norfolk on the global map, showing the region's historical and cultural importance.\" The Conservative leader of Norfolk County Council, Kay Mason Billig, said the announcement of the film was \"fantastic news for this once-in-a-lifetime project\". \"The film will shine a spotlight on the extraordinary work to turn the clock back 900 years and present Norwich Castle Keep in all its Norman splendour,\" she said. \"We are very excited by this opportunity to share the story of the keep's transformation with audiences across the UK and beyond.\"",

        "content": "Historian offers new theory for Sutton Hoo graves 11 January 2025 Share Save Alice Cunningham BBC News, Suffolk Share Save Getty Images The Sutton Hoo helmet found during the initial excavation The famous Sutton Hoo burial site may have also included graves of soldiers recruited by a foreign army, new research has revealed. Helen Gittos, 50, an associate professor of early medieval history at the University of Oxford, has released a new research paper into the Anglo Saxon wonder near Woodbridge in Suffolk. She has put forward a theory that those buried at Sutton Hoo could have been recruited by the Byzantine Army in the eastern Mediterranean in 575 AD, based on items found during excavations. Angus Wainwright, regional archaeologist for the National Trust, said the team was \"excited\" scholars were still so interested in Sutton Hoo. Contributed Dr Helen Gittos has offered a different way of looking at those who were buried at Sutton Hoo During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Gittos examined distribution maps of copper items that travelled from the eastern Mediterranean region to eastern Britain around 600 AD. She wondered why this could have happened and started her research. Similar Byzantine items from the eastern Mediterranean had previously been been uncovered at Sutton Hoo in 1986, with more found in 2012. Traditionally it has been thought these items had been gifted to those buried at the site, including royal kings of the region. Sutton Hoo - first excavated by self-taught archaeologist Basil Brown in 1939 - is widely considered to be England's Valley of the Kings and the potential burial site of King Raedwald, a great king of East Anglia who died in AD624. Trustees of the British Museum/PA Archaeologists uncovered an Anglo-Saxon burial ship at Sutton Hoo thought to be related to King Raedwald in 1939 But Dr Gittos suggests Byzantine Army soldiers - recruited from the region in AD575 to fight in a war - may also have been buried there based on the items excavated. \"Some of them survived and brought back gifts, mementos, some of the things that they looted, and that's why they appear in their graves in eastern Britain,\" she explained. \"Normally we have thought about these as being diplomatic gifts - maybe they were brought to the grave site by people in modern day France or elsewhere to honour this king. \"But we find this material in lots of other graves too.\" 'Completely different way of thinking' Dr Gittos acknowledged her research remained just a theory at this stage. She explained it had not been properly considered that the Byzantine Army had recruited from Britain before, instead historians believing they hired men from Germany and France. She added there was a \"real temptation to underestimate how connected the world was in the early middle ages\". \"I'm not saying that I can prove that this is so, but it is a completely different way of thinking about these men as being part of a much more connected world and I think that's something that fits with our current understanding about the early middle ages,\" she continued. \"People in eastern Britain were not cut off and isolated, they were part of these much more extended networks and influence. \"Recent work that has been going on in Sutton Hoo and nearby has shown this in other ways, that there are Byzantine coins and other things which indicate there are lots of other mechanisms going on, including trade, that these people were part of a much wider world.\" Adam Parsons The Byzantine army was at war with the Sassanian Empire in the late 6th Century Mr Wainwright told the BBC the team had been aware of Dr Gittos work and while Byzantine items had been found at the site before, Dr Gittos mercenary theory was new. While he said it was a \"perfectly possible\" theory, he believed the Byzantine items were more likely gifts for the king of the region at the time. \"All but two of the graves at Sutton Hoo were robbed so we're dealing with little bits left behind by the grave robbers and they include bits of Byzantine objects,\" he explained. \"I don't think it's necessarily that the people in the grave were these mercenaries, although some of them might have been, but maybe there were mercenaries amongst the young men in the court of East Anglia who went out east, came back and gave their superior these rich gifts which would have been really glamorous things at the time in northern Europe.\" He added that Sutton Hoo \"always encouraged more research\" around mysteries that still remained of the site and some artefacts found at the site could still be seen here by the public. James Dobson/National Trust Archaeologist Angus Wainwright is heavily involved in projects at Sutton Hoo Laura Howarth, archaeology and engagement manager at Sutton Hoo, added that whatever the origin of the items found at the site, it spoke \"of a connection to an identity aligned with the Byzantine world and beyond\". Sue Brunning, curator of European Early Medieval and Sutton Hoo Collections at the British Museum, shared her thoughts on the research. \"This research offers exciting new possibilities for understanding Britain's connections to the wider world during the early medieval period,\" she said. \"The Sutton Hoo ship burial has long shown how objects could cross vast distances at this time, but Dr Gittos emphasises how people and ideas moved just as freely.\" Time for a Sutton Hoo rethink?",

        "content": "Off-road bikers using ancient monuments as racetracks 8 January 2025 Share Save Steffan Messenger Environment correspondent, BBC Wales News Share Save BBC The banks of the Tor Clawdd ring cairn are being eroded by off-road bikers Ancient monuments across the UK face \"complete destruction\" from off-road bikers illegally using them as ramps and racetracks, archaeologists have warned. Examples include a Bronze Age ring cairn near Swansea - a potential burial site - which bikers have been riding around. Heneb (The Trust for Welsh Archaeology) said what may seem like \"lumps and bumps\" in the landscape could be of huge significance and greater awareness of the historic environment was needed. Cadw, the Welsh government's historic environment service, said it was working with local communities and police to tackle what it described as a \"devastating\" and \"very prevalent\" problem. \"It's a sad state of affairs,\" said councillor Gordon Walker, surveying damage to Tor Clawdd ring cairn on a remote and windswept part of Mynydd y Gwair common, north of Swansea. \"They're cutting it up, it'll disappear forever,\" he added, showing how the banks of the prehistoric meeting place had been eroded by motorbike riders, exposing bare earth to the elements. \"The site as it is now needs to be fenced off, and information panels put up,\" he said. \"It's been here for over 3,000 years and needs to be preserved\". A banked and ditched circular earthwork, the Tor Clawdd cairn is thought to have been constructed between 2300 and 800 BC. \"The bikers tend to come up here on the weekend and I can understand the buzz they have in riding out here in the open,\" added community councillor Gareth Richards. \"But it's devastating to see the damage - this is our history.\" The low bank forms almost a complete circle and stands alongside an ancient causeway. It was thought to be \"a ritual site, or even used for burial and burning\", Mr Richards explained. It is one of more than 30,000 scheduled ancient monuments across the UK, of which about 4,200 are in Wales. These are sites which are protected by law for their archaeological and historical value and include more well-known examples such as Stonehenge and Caernarfon Castle. Gareth Richards of Mawr Community Council lives near the Tor Clawdd monument and said motorcyclists were using it as a \"turning point\" Dr Alex Langlands of Swansea University said \"forensically important evidence of past societies\" was being destroyed at Tor Clawdd, a site which had not yet been excavated. The archaeologist, also known for presenting TV programmes such as Digging Up Britain's Past, said ancient monuments faced \"many and varied risks\" ranging from climate change to increased levels of tourism. But damage from off-road vehicles was becoming \"a growing issue\" for the sector, he warned. Getty Images It is only legal to ride an off-road motorbike on private land with the landowner's permission At another scheduled monument on Swansea's Kilvey Hill, where Roman era pottery had been unearthed in the 1970s, he pointed to more evidence of tyre tracks. \"There's a lot of off-road biking that goes on here and it's starting to encroach on the monument,\" he said. \"It's in a precarious position.\" Enforcement at sites was an issue, he said, while funding cuts had made it harder to communicate their importance to the public. Fresh motorcycle tracks across a scheduled ancient monument on Kilvey Hill near Swansea Archaeological trusts, alongside Cadw, were in a \"challenging position\", trying to \"maintain monuments and look after them without necessarily having the resources to do so\". \"Wales has a fantastic history and heritage and much of it is written in the landscape - so we need to look after and care for these sites,\" he added. \"If we lose sight of that we lose sight of social cohesion.\" Dr Alex Langlands said dealing with damage to ancient monuments was \"really quite challenging\" Claudine Gerrard of Heneb agreed \"unprecedented cuts\" in recent years had meant the sector was \"forced to do less and less\". Illegal off-roading was a \"significant issue that takes a large resource to tackle\", she said. Archaeological trusts were working in partnership with Cadw, local authorities and the police, including in areas such as the Blaenavon industrial landscape in Torfaen, designated a World Heritage Site. South Wales Police Aerial photographs show the extent of the bike tracks on coal tips in Rhondda Cynon Taf \"It's made up of a huge amount of lumps and bumps with evidence from the industrial use of that landscape but it's also really popular with off-roaders,\" she explained. \"The damage that does particularly to earthwork monuments - (it's) complete destruction essentially.\" She urged people to make use of Archwilio - an online database of historical sites before embarking on any off-roading activity to help plan a safe and legal trip that would not damage the historic environment. Using mapping apps and their aerial photos can be one way for researchers to look for damage to ancient monuments The introduction of new legislation was designed to make it easier to prosecute cases of unlawful damage to scheduled monuments. Jonathan Berry, senior inspector of ancient monuments and archaeology for Cadw said people were now expected \"to make every possible, reasonable attempt to find out whether the area of ground to be used is scheduled\". \"Off-road vehicles and bikes can be enormously damaging and we have certain areas of Wales where we know that this is very prevalent,\" he said. The situation at Tor Clawdd had been reported to Cadw, leading to an inspection of the site and a report which was shared with police. A Wales-wide neighbourhood watch scheme for ancient monuments had also been launched in recent years, known as Operation Heritage Cymru, and was delivering \"good results\", he added. \"Our communities across Wales are fundamental to Cadw being able to look after the historic environment - they act as our eyes and ears,\" he said. CADW People who damage ancient monuments can no longer rely on a defence of ignorance under new legislation, Jonathan Berry of Cadw explained The Welsh government said: \"We continue to prioritise our statutory responsibilities despite the pressures on public sector finances.\" \"December's draft budget includes a funding uplift for Cadw in both revenue (to  9.4m) and capital (to  16.3m).\" This funding would \"support statutory conservation work for Cadw's historic properties and wider grants for the heritage at risk across Wales\".",

British sailor Tony Bullimore had just made himself a cup of tea and was settling down to eat some crackers and corned beef in the galley of his racing boat, the Exide Challenger, when he heard the sound of a crack. \"The snap was like a match,\" he said in a BBC documentary in 1997.

        "content": "Research suggests mass grave from 1600s Civil War 7 January 2025 Share Save Sophie Parker BBC News, Wiltshire Share Save BBC Retired GP Dr Norman Beale has researched several areas A retired GP has developed a theory as to where a mass grave containing the bodies of hundreds killed in a 1643 Civil War battle could be located. Dr Norman Beale said he had used satellite imagery and older records of archaeological finds to locate the site. The Battle of Roundway Down in the countryside overlooking Devizes is believed to have left hundreds dead - some estimate as many as 600. Dr Beale has previously published books on local history and his latest project has been published in an academic journal for Wiltshire. Historic England has described the Battle of Roundway Down as \"one of the most interesting and dramatic battles of the First Civil War\". While Parliamentarians outnumbered Royalists at the battle, fighting saw them defeated. Dr Beale spent a long time during the pandemic going through satellite images online to develop his theory Dr Beale said he had used satellite, aerial and LiDAR images during his research. LiDAR is Light Detection and Ranging - a technology which uses laser light to create a 3D representation of the earth's surface. All had shown \"a very long line\" across a field which he said was \"not just a fault of the image\" and which had come up \"again and again\". \"It ignores boundaries put in place later on by farming and woodland planted in the 1840s,\" he said. \"My theory is that this line represents a trench. \"This is where the chaps planting this wood in 1840 found four skeletons.\" Older records Dr Beale has researched had also shown \"two accidental findings of skeletons on the down from people not interested in them\", he said. Both were along the line he has spotted. \"Their significance was not seen at the time by the people who found them,\" he said. \"They were covered over and lost again.\" Culture Club/Getty Images This 1800s depiction of the Civil War Battle of Naseby shows what the battle at Roundway Down may have looked like There is no reference to these skeletons having any clothing or items with them - something Dr Beale said was a \"major clue\" that they were from the battle as bodies would have been stripped, with clothing also valuable at that time. While many bodies were buried in deeper pits after battles, Dr Beale explained that the soil on Roundway Down was shallow, so a long trench for burial would make sense. He does not want to reveal the exact place where the line is - while there are footpaths, much of the down is private land and there is the risk of people looking illegally. Ultimately however, Dr Beale would like to see his theory confirmed with more archaeology.",

Oxford Cotswold Archaeology discovered a lead package containing 321 silver coins in mint condition during excavations at Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast. The team believed the bundle of coins could have been the savings pot of a local figure, fearing regime changes following the coronation of Edward the Confessor in 1042. Archaeologist Andrew Pegg said he was shaking when he found the coins. Oxford Cotswold Archaeology The bundle was unearthed during excavations at the Sizewell C power station site \"I was shaking when I first unearthed it, seeing a single coin edge peeking at me,\" he recalled. \"A perfect archaeological time capsule. \"The information we are learning from it is stunning and I'm so proud to have added to the history of my own little part of Suffolk.\" Mr Pegg referred to the collection as \"the pasty\" due to the coins being wrapped in a lead bundle barely bigger than a Cornish pasty. The discovery will feature on the new season of Digging for Britain on BBC Two and iPlayer at 20:00 GMT. Oxford Cotswold Archaeology Archaeologists believe the coins may have been a savings pot The coins date between 1036 and 1044 during the reigns of Harold I, Harthacnut and Edward the Confessor. A large number of them were minted in London, but others were struck at locations including Thetford and Norwich in Norfolk, as well as more locally in Ipswich and further away in Lincoln and Stamford in Lincolnshire. The archaeologists said it represented a substantial amount of money to most people of the time and likely belonged to someone of middle status, rather than anyone of very high status or national importance.

Treasure expert Helen Geake described the find as one of \"probably less than a dozen in the country\" and \"only the fifth\" on the British Museum's Portable Antiquities database. The late 6th to early 7th Century mount, or boss, was unearthed during an event organised by Digging History UK near King's Lynn, Norfolk. Paul Mortimer, who has created replicas of weapons found at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk - where an Anglo-Saxon burial ship was discovered - said it probably attached a sword scabbard to a warrior's belt \"with some form of very thin fabric or leather\". \"Swords are usually detachable from the belts in some way and it [the boss] was probably used to help attach the belt to the sword - that's what I've done with the Sutton Hoo replica,\" said the retired teacher, who lives near Chelmsford in Essex. Paul Mortimer Paul Mortimer said the only part of his replica not evidenced by Sutton Hoo's archaeology was the hemp string connecting the two ends of the scabbard loop holding the bosses (above) The boss would have been mounted on to a thick rim of white organic material such as bone, ivory or antler, which has long since vanished. Dr Geake, who is Norfolk's finds liaison officer, said there is little evidence of how they would have been used - which is why Mr Mortimer's research is helpful. \"They are never identical - even the two found on the Sutton Hoo sword are slightly different from each other,\" she added. She speculated it might have been a peace band, which were referenced in the Norse Sagas. The sagas retell stories from the Viking era, but were written hundreds of years after the events, from 1200 onwards. \"Unfastening a peace band is something you had to do before taking a sword out of a scabbard... to make someone go through a step before taking out their sword, to stop violence erupting quickly,\" Dr Geake said. A replica of the sword was part of an exhibition at the National Trust-owned Sutton Hoo site in 2022 But Mr Mortimer said: \"I think it's possible to speculate it's about eyes - one of the early writers called the bosses, on their white backing, the eye of the sword, which I think is a fairly good insight.\" He has written a paper with Neil Price, currently professor of archaeology at the University of Uppsala, Sweden, about ritual depictions of the one-eyed Norse god Odin. As Sutton Hoo is \"exceptional in having two bosses\", he wondered if most swords would have had just the one - \"honouring the eye of the god\", he said.

        "content": "Buried plaque sends detectorist on WW1 quest 29 December 2024 Share Save Helen Burchell BBC News, East of England Share Save David Stuckey Rupert Thompson, (centre) pictured in his early career in the Army Mystery surrounds the story of a World War One soldier whose commemorative plaque led a keen metal detectorist to try to track down his family. Amateur historian David Stuckey, from Stevenage, was detecting in a field in Bedfordshire in 1999 when he came across a battered bronze plaque bearing the name Robert Arthur Thompson. Years later he made it his mission to find out more, and realised the soldier had enlisted under a different name, but was buried in France under his original name - Rupert Archibald Thompson. Mr Stuckey eventually tracked down distant relatives in Buckinghamshire and Suffolk, but to this day no-one knows why Rupert became Robert, or how his plaque came to be lost in a county not related to any known family member. David Stuckey The plaque was bent in half and looked like a piece of old metal when it was found When he found the plaque, Mr Stuckey initially thought it was a brass plate from an old tractor. It was folded in half and there was seemingly nothing about it that caught his interest. However, he took it home, put it away in a box of items labelled \"detecting junk\" and forgot about it. A while later, he took it out and put it in a vice, in an attempt to straighten the disc in case that gave him further clues. Unfortunately it broke in two, but it did reveal some details, including the figure of Britannia, a lion and a name - Robert Arthur Thompson. David Stuckey The plaque broke in two when Mr Stuckey attempted to straighten it David Stuckey The name could be seen on the plaque The bronze plaque itself was not that unusual, as more than one million were sent to the families of those who died in the Great War between 1914 and 1918. About 12.5cm (5in) in diameter, they became known popularly as the Death Plaque, Dead Man s Penny, or Widow s Penny. However, it was the name on this particular plaque that piqued the detectorist's interest. A friend searched a list of those who died during World War One and found Thompson's name among them. He had served as a sergeant in the 6th Battalion Queen's (Royal West Surrey) Regiment, and had lived in Carshalton, which is now part of the London Borough of Sutton. The record stated he was killed in action on 4 April 1917 in France and his serial number was recorded as G/22548. Mr Stuckey's friend then trawled the records of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to try to track down his burial site. \"That's when it got interesting,\" said Mr Stuckey. \"Nothing came up under the soldier's name, so he put in the initials - RA - and it came up with the name of Rupert Archibald Thompson. \"All the other details were identical, and it stated he had died at the age of 30, and was buried at Faubourg D'Amiens cemetery in Arras, in France.\" It was \"now a bit of a mystery\", said Mr Stuckey. \"Why did Rupert change his name when he joined the Army?\" David Stuckey One of Sgt Thompson's relatives had this photograph and on the back it said that Rupert was third from the left Without his own computer at that time, the plaque went back in its box, but years later, Mr Stuckey had another go at solving the mystery. He found an extract from Sgt Thompson's regiment's war diary from the week in which he was killed. It appeared that the unit was billeted in the basement of the museum in Arras and Mr Stuckey believed he was one of those killed when it was hit by a shell. But the question why Rupert changed his name continued to haunt him. Mr Stuckey said he had considered Rupert may have had a medical condition that precluded him from military service or he might have had a criminal record. \"I've had a rather fanciful theory that maybe he had a dalliance with a young lady, resulting in a pregnancy and rather than stay and face up to his responsibilities, where better to hide - join the Army under a false name and disappear,\" he pondered. \"But... maybe be he just didn't like his own name, Rupert Archibald - he wanted to a warrior's name.\" Rupert did not have any known children, so Mr Stuckey began looking at other members of the family - most of whom were also childless. But he found the eldest brother - Eric Thompson. Eric had married and had three children with his wife Gertrude. \"It appeared that Eric had died in 1917, like his brother Rupert, serving in France,\" said Mr Stuckey. David Stuckey Pvt Eric Thompson was the older brother of Rupert, and also died in France in 1917 However, he managed to track down two grandchildren of Eric and Gertrude - Alan, from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire and his sister June, from Exning, in Suffolk. Neither knew anything about their family's history as their ancestors had been split up after Gertrude's death in 1919 during the Spanish flu outbreak. He met with them and said they were \"absolutely gobsmacked - they knew precious little about any of the family's history - and were desperate to know more\". They had an old tin full of family photographs and letters but had no idea who the people were. \"I was able to tell them who everybody was, and they were absolutely ecstatic,\" Mr Stuckey said. \"All their family history was now being put into context.\" David Stuckey Rupert is buried in a cemetery in Arras, in north-east France - at this time the rank was spelt as serjeant, rather than the modern sergeant One of the photographs the relatives had showed a group of soldiers and on the back was written: \"Rupert, third from left.\" \"I just could not believe it - here was the man on the plaque. And I can't tell you how I felt finally having a face to the name on that plaque - it was unbelievable,\" he said. \"It doesn't look like I'll get any answers to my big questions. \"I'm never going to know why he changed his name and I'm never going to know who buried his plaque in a field in Bedfordshire. \"But I was happy with what I'd got. \"It does go to show what amazing stories can emerge just by finding a piece of metal with a name on it.\" Mr Stuckey still has the plaque and takes it to talks he gives at metal detecting clubs in East Anglia.",

These ancient structures, dating from 4,000 to 2,000 BCE, stand as enduring testaments to early human culture and belief systems. There are about 250 examples scattered across the Welsh landscape - though experts estimate this represents only a third of the sites that once existed. Professor of Archaeology at the University of Coimbra and research fellow at Liverpool University George Nash explores this transformation in his book The Neolithic Tombs of Wales. It looks at the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to farming communities. This marked a pivotal shift in human history, fostering more permanent settlements and rituals that celebrated the deceased. Prof Nash highlighted the profound changes in burial practices over the 2,000-year span of the Neolithic period. \"Two thousand years is a long period, even for us today,\" Prof Nash said. \"Imagine how religious practices have evolved since the birth of Christianity. \"Similarly, we see changes in Neolithic architecture and burial methods, from natural caves to constructed stone tombs and earthen mounds, and from simple burial to cremation and excarnation... the process of exposing bodies to the elements until only bones remain.\" Prof George Nash Prof George Nash is the authour of Neolithic Tombs of Wales This practice of ritual burial is believed to have originated among early Neolithic groups in the \"Fertile Crescent\" - a region encompassing parts of modern-day Turkey, Israel, Syria and Lebanon - before gradually spreading westward. The process took at least 600 years. \"With this westward spread came not only burial traditions but also tools, pottery, and jewellery intended to accompany the dead into the afterlife,\" Prof Nash explained. \"Though no written evidence survives, these artefacts suggest an early belief in an afterlife where such items might be needed.\" Prof George Nash A chambered cairn near Fishguard in Pembrokeshire The majority of Welsh burial sites are located near the coast, a pattern Prof Nash attributes to the strategic advantages these areas offered. Proximity to the sea allowed Neolithic communities to sustain themselves with fishing and marine resources, crucial supplements in case of crop failure or livestock loss. Prof George Nash The Chambered tomb of Gwal-y-Filias near Crymych, Pembrokeshire The availability of stone in coastal regions further contributed to the preservation of these monuments. \"The remoteness of these areas, coupled with their marginal agricultural value, helped shield many sites from modern development and agricultural practices,\" Prof Nash noted. \"This stands in contrast to other parts of Britain and Europe, where road building and field-clearance during the 18th and 19th centuries caused widespread destruction of these monuments.\" DNA evidence suggests that the earliest monuments, such as portal dolmens (or cromlechs in Welsh), were reserved for society's elite. Over time, larger communal tombs emerged, reflecting a shift toward burying extended family groups or community members.

The BBC's Hidden East Yorkshire podcast has been seeking the answers to these questions and many more. The series takes in a wide range of topics, from unmasking Jack the Ripper, to the day The Beatles came to Hull. Here are two of the most intriguing tales covered by the programme over the past year. You can enjoy more by visiting the podcast on BBC Sounds. In search of sanctuary Imagine you are on the run, being chased by people who think you are guilty of a crime that you say you did not commit. Your last hope of escaping rough justice is to make it to the town of Beverley. On the outskirts, with the minster in sight, you reach a tall stone cross. It marks the beginning of \"sanctuary\", where you are safe from capture   in theory at least. During the medieval era, prisons were a rarity, certainly outside London. \"Justice was pretty fierce,\" says Barbara English, a professor of history. \"You just pulled them out and hanged them, or cut their hands off.\" The remains of one of the sanctuary stones Hangings took place at the end of Gallows Lane, near what is now Beverley Racecourse. But those who claimed sanctuary and took an oath were safe from the noose, for the time being. They had 40 days to decide whether to hand themselves in for trial or leave the country and go into exile. So how did Beverley become a sanctuary town? According to the Rev Canon Jonathan Baker, the vicar of Beverley Minster, the concept goes back to the Old Testament. \"The idea was that anybody who was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder, could find refuge in a society where the relatives of the victim might well get a posse together and go in pursuit of the perpetrators   so there'd be a kind of rough justice and the risk of blood feuds,\" he said. \"The idea of the cities of refuge was to stop that from happening.\" Murderers, thieves & debtors flocked to Beverley in Medieval times, seeking one thing. According to tradition, King Athelstan granted sanctuary status to the town after a victory over the Scots in 934. Before the battle, he prayed to St John of Beverley, a holy man whose tomb became popular with pilgrims. Today, the remains of three \"sanctuary stones\"   there were originally four   can still be seen near the main roads into Beverley, though the crosses are long gone. When felons passed one of the stones, their pursuers would have to give up the chase   or pay a hefty fine to the Church. The fines got bigger the closer a person got to the minster. If they made it to the altar or the fridstool (freedom stool)   a small stone chair   the pursuers were in danger of losing their own lives. The town kept a record of fugitives, known as the Sanctuary Book. Of the 500 names recorded, only three are those of women. One was Elizabeth Nelson, from Pollington, near Goole, who claimed sanctuary in the second year of the reign of Henry VIII. \"She's described in the record as a spinster,\" said Prof English. \"She came into the sanctuary for the murder of a child at Hull.\" Dr English believes she may have been a nanny, though it is not clear whether the alleged offence stemmed from an abortion or the death of a child. Sanctuary died out later in the reign of Henry VIII because he saw it as a symbol of the power of the Church. However, the Rev Baker says its legacy continues. \"These places were designed to be a little bit of heaven on earth. They were deliberately otherworldly. \"In that sense we still see ourselves as a place of sanctuary, a place where you can get things in perspective, get a piece of the bigger picture.\" Haunted by beasts They lurked in the misty, pitch-black marshes of the River Hull valley. Hobgoblins and mysterious beasts once were said to haunt the land that is now East Yorkshire. Tiddy Mun was a bog spirit who dwelt in the waterholes and came out in the evenings when the mists rose, dressed in grey, with white hair and a long tangled beard. Awd Goggie was a giant caterpillar in charge of the orchards. And the Barghest was a spectre who took the form of a bear or a black dog with large, flaming eyes as big as saucers. Old beliefs die hard, but science can help to explain the origins of these myths and legends, and provide us with a link the the past, according to Richard Myerscough, a geologist and member of the Tophill Low Archaeological and Historical Survey Team (Toast). \"Thirty-thousand years ago, you could have walked from the Wolds to the Continent, across a wet, boggy landscape of trees, open water, rivers, springs, bogs,\" he says. \"Across there, our early ancestors came.\" Who were the beasts that haunted the settlers from Doggerland?",

These works are among the most widely available representations of Christian art, shaping how the world views this biblical event and subliminally divesting those outside the West from influencing it. But over the centuries, artists in India have sought to express their vision of this event by painting Jesus's birth and other Christian themes in their own style. Some have done so consciously, others unconsciously, but the end result is a body of work that breathes new life and meaning into the event of Christ's birth, and Christianity itself. Here are some paintings from Indian art history that present Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective. Mughal emperor Muhammad Jalaluddin Akbar is credited with introducing northern India to Christianity by inviting Jesuit missionaries to visit his court. The missionaries brought with them holy scriptures and European artworks on Christian themes which influenced court painters. Akbar and his successors also commissioned many murals with Christian themes and some court painters began infusing these paintings with elements of Islamic art. Neha Vermani, a historian of South Asia, talks about a painting made by Mughal court artists which featured emperor Jahangir in the nativity scene, which traditionally feature Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus. \"Mughal rulers saw themselves as being 'just' rulers, capable of maintaining harmony and balance in their kingdoms; they were 'universal rulers'. Allowing different religions to co-exist was integral to how they saw themselves and wanted themselves to be remembered,\" Ms Vermani says. The 18th Century painting below features typical stylistic elements of Mughal art, including highly stylised figures, vibrant colours, naturalism and ornamentation. The Trustees of the British Museum An 18th Century Mughal style painting of the Virgin Mary and child From the British Library archive A 1630 painting of the Virgin and child with influences of Islamic art Born in 1887 in what is now India's West Bengal state, Jamini Roy is celebrated for creating a unique visual language by bringing together elements of Bengali folk art and Kalighat paintings - a distinctive art form that originated in the vicinity of a renowned temple in Kolkata city. Ashish Anand, CEO and managing director of art firm DAG says that art critic WG Archer once observed that Christ represented a Santhal figure (the Santhals are an Indian tribal group) for Jamini Roy. \"The simplicity of Christ's life and his sacrifice appealed to Roy, making his paintings on Christian themes at least as important as those on Hindu mythology, all of them rendered in the folk style of modernism that he made distinctively his own,\" he says. Image Courtesy: DAG A 1950s tempera on fabric painting of Madonna and child by Jamini Roy Image Courtesy: DAG Madonna with Jesus and the Magi by Jamini Roy Born in 1902 in the western state of Goa, Angelo de Fonseca is credited with creating unique Christian iconography that married Eastern and Western influences with his Goan sensibilities. In his paintings, Mary isn't depicted as a fair maiden in a blue gown, but looks very much like an Indian woman with brown skin, dressed in a sari and wearing a mangalsutra (a piece of traditional Indian jewellery worn by married Hindu women).

In a small town fringed by banana trees in northern Colombia, a solitary yellow butterfly flutters through the languid, muggy air. Vallenato folk music floats from a shop window, as bicycles as glide down the sun-soaked streets. And the sides of buildings, storefronts and a weathered door with peeling paint all carry the same name: Macondo. Book lovers might recognise Macondo as the fictional town in One Hundred Years of Solitude, written by Nobel Prize-winning Colombian author Gabriel Garc a M rquez. Considered one of the 20th Century's best-known novels and a masterpiece of magical realism, the book has sold 50 million copies and has been translated into more than 40 languages since it was published in 1967. Now, it's the subject of a popular new Netflix series. While the fictional village of Macondo was recreated on a set in central Colombia for the series, residents here in Garc a M rquez's childhood hometown of Aracataca   and even Garc a M rquez himself   credit the town with inspiring his work.

Right now, I'm standing in Nova Gorica   a modest but beautiful planned Modernist town in Slovenia with a population of 30,000. But if I take just a few steps, I can cross an invisible border into Italy to the medieval town of Gorizia, without even showing my passport. Once upon a time, Nova Gorica and Gorizia were one; the two cities were created   and separated   in 1947 after World War Two when the Treaty of Paris established Europe's new borders, restricting travel between Italy and the former Yugoslavia. An Allied commission determined that Gorizia should belong to Italy and the less-developed part of town should be part of the Slovenian republic within the Socialist Federalist Republic of Yugoslavia. The new town was to be called Nova Gorica (New Gorizia), and from that moment on, Nova Gorica and Gorizia have existed as two towns split across two countries. But with Slovenia's entry into the EU in 2004, the border between them was dissolved, allowing a cross-cultural exchange for the first time in generations. And in 2025, Gorizia/Nova Gorica will reunite as the first transnational European Capital of Culture, in a project called GO!2025. Because of this accolade, between two and five million visitors are expected to descend upon the two towns in 2025, compared to the usual 250,000 annual tourists. That's a big leap for an otherwise under-touristed, out-of-the-way destination, even if Gorizia was dubbed \"the Austrian Nice\" from 1867 to 1918 when it was part of Austria-Hungary.

On 6 December 1987, Cornwall took on South Korea in a match that had a lasting impact on both teams. Players from both sides that day have been speaking to BBC News. Phil Monckton The match happened at the start of a period of democratic reform in South Korea A fledgeling democracy December 1987 was a momentous month for South Korea - and not just on the rugby pitch. Ten days after the match, at the Redruth Recreation Ground, the country held its first democratic presidential election in 16 years. It started a process that saw the country remodel itself on a US-style democracy after years of Cold War isolationism. Cho Sung-chul, South Korea's full back for the match, said: \"Obviously I was quite thrilled about going to the home of rugby.\" At the time, only a very limited number of South Koreans were permitted to travel overseas. Mr Cho said the excitement of visiting England was \"so overwhelming\" that he struggled to sleep the night before the match, adding \"that's how excited I was\". Mr Cho, who played for the national team for about 10 years, said, despite playing at the Hong Kong Sevens, the Cornwall match was one of the first times the team had played in Europe or against European players. Despite losing the game 39-13, Mr Cho said it was \"immensely beneficial for our team - personally I learnt a great deal from the experience\". Phil Monckton Cornwall captain Grant Champion said the South Koreans played a more expansive style of rugby than his teammates were used to 'Improvised rugby' Cornwall's inside centre, Grant Champion, who captained the side, remembered the South Koreans played a very different, more expansive, style of rugby than his teammates were used to. \"They relied more on broken play and improvised rugby than first phase, second phase running the ball,\" he said. Mr Champion said South Korean rugby was in its \"heyday\" - the 1980s is considered a golden era for the side - so the Cornish team had low exceptions. The Cornish side was transitioning into a \"far better side\" with a \"strong pack\", he said, and it was \"the start of a golden patch for Cornwall Rugby, so we met them at the right time\". \"It was always an honour, [but] to play against a national side and captain your county; well, it doesn't get much better down here,\" he said. A lasting legacy Former player and now Cornish Pirates media officer Phil Westren said the game was brought about by the vision of Cornishman and retired England captain John Kendall-Carpenter. \"We were really lucky to have a person like him who wanted to bring quality rugby, and different types of rugby, from different countries to Cornwall for the players to play against and the supporters to see - it was fantastic,\" he said. South Korea hosted the Seoul Olympics in 1988 and even tried, unsuccessfully, to introduce rugby as an Olympic sport that year. Choi Jae-sub, vice president of the South Korea Rugby Union, said the game still had less support than other sports but the legacy of their first European match resonated to this day. \"We still play well and try to enhance the performance level,\" he said.

The Gabalfa apple dates back to the Victorian period when it was described as being \"sufficiently good for a late dessert apple, and a very valuable one for culinary purposes\". Believed to have died out, it was rediscovered in Carmarthenshire in 2004 by the Marcher Apple Network, a group of enthusiasts keen to revive old varieties of apples and pears. The 50 Gabalfa trees, as well as hundreds of other fruit trees, to be planted around Cardiff are intended to both increase biodiversity and honour the legacy of the Pettigrew family who are credited with creating the city's modern landscape. Jennifer Burke, from Cardiff Council, said the tree-planting project, Coed Caerdydd, was part of efforts to tackle climate change and \"expand Cardiff's tree canopy\". As well as the 50 Gabalfa apple trees, it would also see 450 other fruit trees, including apples, pears, plums and cherries, as well as new hedgegrows, planted around the city. Project manager Chris Engel said the programme aims to \"follow in the footsteps of the people who made the incredible green spaces, and make our parks the green lungs of Cardiff once again\". He added that \"the way we appreciate the open spaces of modern Cardiff is entirely down to the Pettigrews . Starting as a gardener employed by John Crichton-Stuart, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, Andrew Pettigrew and his three sons transformed Cardiff's green spaces into the public parks residents enjoy today. BBC Wales Chris Engel, project manager at Coed Caerdydd, said it aims to make parks \"the green lungs of Cardiff once again\" Andrew Senior, who was born in 1883, was the son of a Scottish shoemaker who initially worked at Dumfries House, the Bute residence in Ayrshire, before moving to work on the family's estate in Cardiff. Unlike his sons, who would all train in horticulture at Kew Gardens, Andrew was entirely self-taught. Despite this, he not only introduced the Gabalfa apple, but also bred the first commercially-successful wine grapes in Wales. Rosie James, formerly principal landscape architect at Cardiff Council, said the Marquess' grounds were \"famous for their landscaping\". She said they borrowed from renowned designer Lancelot 'Capability' Brown in style, \"but with more modern Victorian growing methods\".  From the boating lake at Roath Park to the lines of limes in Cathays Park, you can see the fingerprints of the Pettigrews all over Cardiff.\"  They wanted beautiful spaces for people to walk in, but there was also an eye on the budget, and the need for the parks to pay for themselves,\" Mrs James said. Bute Park is today an important public green space in central Cardiff From 1873 to 1947 the Bute family arranged the transfer of beautiful landscapes into public ownership. While walking through the grounds was free to the public, there were charges for activities such as fishing, bowling, football and ice-skating, and there was sometimes conflict between the competing activities.  Today we would value wildlife more than fishing, but the Pettigrews saw otters as a threat to the viability of their fishing lake,\" Mrs James said. \"One report in the gardener s notes records the successful killing of a 22lb (10kg) otter, which was decimating the lake s fish stock.\" When Roath Lake failed to freeze over, the Pettigrews even considered flooding a football pitch to use as an ice rink in order to \"maximise revenue\". Both Andrew Senior and the Marquess died around the turn of the 20th century, and shortly before his death in October 1900, the Marquess is said to have remarked to Andrew Pettigrew:  See all this before us, this is yours and my legacy for now and generations to come.\" Today the four Pettigrews are remembered with a tea room at the entrance to Bute Park",

The 80-year mystery 15 December 2024 Share Save Louise Parry BBC News, Bedfordshire Share Save PA Media Major Glenn Miller joined the US Air Force as a musician to bolster morale among the troops On 15 December 1944, the hugely popular musician Major Glenn Miller boarded a small plane at an RAF base in Bedfordshire. The American army band leader was heading to Paris to cheer on the Allied forces, but never arrived. The Norseman aircraft has not been found, but 80 years of theories and investigations have significantly narrowed down the possibilities. Music for the troops Glenn Miller was a trombone player, conductor and composer who became famous during the 1930s and '40s with his swing orchestra. Their big band hits such as In The Mood and Chattanooga Choo Choo dominated the airwaves during World War Two. In 1942, after the US was drawn into the war, Miller became a US Army Air Force captain and the leader of an army band, helping to bolster morale among the troops. Glenn Miller Collections/University of Colorado Boulder Glenn Miller on the trombone with the American military band, playing at an air base in Lancashire A narrow escape In June 1944 he was sent to London, tasked with providing broadcast entertainment to the D-Day forces as they took back territory in Europe. But Bedford tour guide David Fowler said Glenn Miller and his orchestra \"wanted a way out\" of the capital. \"In June the V1s were coming down, there were bomb raids. The band had never been subject to any war, and they were not happy. \"The BBC had been operating in Bedford since the beginning of the war, so it was an obvious place to come,\" said Mr Fowler. Actor David Niven helped the band move to Bedford on Sunday, 2 July, which proved to be a close call. \"On Monday evening, a V1 hit the London billet in Chelsea where the band had been staying - 74 American military were killed in that building,\" Mr Fowler said. Glenn Miller and his band performing at the BBC in Bedford during 1944 Glenn Miller Collections/University of Colorado Boulder Glenn Miller's music remains \"the anthem of our greatest generation\", according to his biographer Dennis Spragg Flight to France Glenn Miller's band spent five months in Bedford, based at Milton Ernest Hall, delighting troops at military bases, performing for BBC broadcasts and recording with the likes of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. But the American musicians were eager to cross to France after the Allies liberated Paris. \"It was always going to be a temporary stopover in the UK. He wanted to follow the Allies' advance as they went into Germany,\" explained Mr Fowler. Miller was asked to travel ahead of the rest of his orchestra to complete arrangements. He was booked to fly by scheduled military transport to Paris on Thursday, 14 December, but bad weather saw the flight cancelled. A US Air Force colleague, Lt Col Norman Baessell, offered Miller a trip on his own flight the following day. \"There were only three of them on the plane   a single-engine Noorduyn C-64 Norseman, piloted by another American,\" said Mr Fowler. The flight departed RAF Twinwood for Villacoublay Aerodrome at 13:55 BST on Friday, 15 December after being delayed by mist and fog. PA Media Glenn Miller set off from Twinwood RAF base in a C-64 Norseman with Flight Officer John R. Stuart Morgan and Lt Col Norman Baessell Gone without a trace \"Military observers charted the aircraft south from England over Beachy Head between 14:30 and 14:45. But it did not appear over France,\" said Dennis Spragg, who has written a biography on Glenn Miller. His band arrived in Paris on 18 December expecting to meet their leader. Confused, they contacted the military authorities, who had not been informed of his travel plans. \"He was in violation of his actual travel orders. However, under pressure to meet a deadline, he had sought to perform his duties as he saw fit,\" said Mr Spragg. \"The gravity of the Glenn Miller disappearance caused shockwaves from London to Washington,\" he added. No trace of the Norseman nor the men on board has ever been found. Various theories have sprung up to explain Miller's disappearance, although most agreed the plane had gone down over the English Channel. Was it shot down by enemy bombers, or the victim of friendly fire? Had it accidentally been hit by bombs discharged from Allied aircraft? Others claimed Miller had made it to Paris and was at the Allies' HQ when a German group attacked, or he died in a brothel in the French capital. David Fowler The control tower at Twinwood RAF base, where Glenn Miller was last seen alive 'An avoidable tragedy' An inquiry held in 1945 in Bedford by the Eighth Air Force concluded the C-64 disappeared over the English Channel due to \"pilot error, mechanical malfunction and poor weather\", said Mr Spragg. Eight decades on, he believes \"there is no mystery\" any longer, as more information has emerged. He said \"we know beyond any doubt\" that the plane \"vanished over water\" and that \"RAF Lancasters did not accidentally cause the C-64 to crash from an errant bomb jettison\". \"The probable causes included icing conditions in the engine, fuel line and on the wings, including carburettor heater failure or possibly a hydraulic fluid leak,\" said Mr Spragg. TV programme The History Detectives also investigated the case and compared subsequent Norseman aircraft crashes. \"The documentary came to the conclusion that a single carburettor in cold weather was subject to freezing up. It was a very cold day on 15 December. It's pretty straightforward that a single engine plane could have easily frozen up,\" said Mr Fowler. Leslie Mitchell, Glenn Miller, Dorothy Carless and Bruce Trent broadcasting in 1944 Mr Spragg said Glenn Miller's music was \"the anthem of the greatest generation\". \"The loss of Maj Glenn Miller on December 15, 1944, was an avoidable tragedy. \"The only remaining question is the location of any debris that might still be found in the English Channel.\"",

But through an ingenious system of engineering and strict organisation, they managed to create the largest empire ever seen in the Americas   a sprawling two-million-sq-km civilisation that extended across parts of modern-day Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina   encompassing as many as 12 million people and 100 languages. It was roughly 10 times the size of the Aztec Empire and had twice its population. Remarkably, the Inca managed to forge this vast society without the wheel, the arch, money, iron or steel tools, draft animals capable of ploughing fields or even a written language. Instead, one of the keys to the Inca's rapid expansion was an extraordinary network of roads used for communication, trade and military campaigns known as the Qhapaq  an (The Royal Road). Considered one of the greatest engineering feats in the ancient world and rapturously proclaimed \"the most stupendous and useful works ever executed by man\" by 19th-Century geographer and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, the Qhapaq  an extended for nearly 40,000km   roughly the circumference of the globe. It stretched from Quito, Ecuador, past Santiago, Chile, on two main north-south arteries, along with more than 20 smaller routes running east to west like a giant ladder. Alamy Some 200 grass-woven suspension bridges once spanned the cliffs of the Inca's Royal Road   today, only one remains (Credit: Alamy) Second in length only to the Roman road system, the Qhapaq  an was in many ways even more impressive, as it traversed some of the planet's most extreme geographical terrains. This historic highway linked the snowcapped peaks of the Andes at more than 6,000m with the continent's steamy rainforests, barren deserts and yawning canyons. To do this, the Inca bore massive tunnels through mountains, lined valleys with immaculate stone paths and carved spiral staircases up cliff faces. Where the earth abruptly ended, they used a brilliant system of suspension bridges to leap canyons and stitch their road network together. But the Inca didn't build their bridges out of metal or wood. They wove them from grass. At the empire's height, it's estimated that some 200 suspension bridges spanned the cliffs along the Qhapaq  an, each one strong enough to support the weight of a marching army. Today, nearly 500 years after the collapse of the Inca Empire, only one bridge remains, and it dangles over the Apurimac River near the 500-person village of Huinchiri in Peru's southern highlands. In the past, each Inca bridge was overseen by a bridge master (chakacamayoc) who was responsible for guarding and repairing it. These days, the last Inca bridge is overseen by the last living Inca bridge master: Arizapana, the latest in an unbroken line of chakacamayocs that he says stretches back to the Inca, like braided rope.",

        "content": "Charles M Schulz drew his beloved Peanuts strip for 50 years until his announcement on 14 December 1999 that ill health was forcing him to retire. In History looks at how an unassuming cartoonist built a billion-dollar empire out of the lives of a group of children, a dog and a bird. Charles M Schulz's timeless creation Charlie Brown may have been as popular as any character in all of literature, but the cartoonist was modest about the scope of his miniature parables. In a 1977 BBC interview, he said: \"I'm talking only about the minor everyday problems in life. Leo Tolstoy dealt with the major problems of the world. I'm only dealing with why we all have the feeling that people don't like us.\" This did not mean that he felt as if he was dealing with trivial matters. He said: \"I'm always very much offended when someone asks me, 'Do I ever do satire on the social condition?' Well, I do it almost every day. And they say, 'Well, do you ever do political things?' I say, 'I do things which are more important than politics. I'm dealing with love and hate and mistrust and fear and insecurity.'\" WATCH: 'Cartooning is drawing funny pictures whether they're silly or rather meaningful political cartoons'. While Charlie Brown may have been the eternal failure, the universal feelings that Schulz channelled helped make Peanuts a global success. Born in 1922, Schulz drew every single Peanuts strip himself from 1950 until his death in February 2000. It was so popular that Nasa named two of the modules in its May 1969 Apollo 10 lunar mission after Charlie Brown and Snoopy. The strip was syndicated in more than 2,600 newspapers worldwide, and inspired films, music and countless items of merchandise. Part of its success, according to the writer Umberto Eco, was that it worked on different levels. He wrote: \"Peanuts charms both sophisticated adults and children with equal intensity, as if each reader found there something for himself, and it is always the same thing, to be enjoyed in two different keys. Peanuts is thus a little human comedy for the innocent reader and for the sophisticated.\" Schulz's initial reason for focusing on children in the strip was strictly commercial. In 1990, he told the BBC: \"I always hate to say it, but I drew little kids because this is what sold. I wanted to draw something, I didn't know what it was, but it just seemed as if whenever I drew children, these were the cartoons that editors seemed to like the best. And so, back in 1950, I mailed a batch of cartoons to New York City, to United Features Syndicate, and they said they liked them, and so ever since I've been drawing little kids.\"",

A new project is bringing fresh life to the city's past - through a rock band. The Tenementals are a group of academics and musicians who aim to use their songs to tell the \"radical history\" of Glasgow. Now the nine-strong collective have released their debut album Glasgow: A History (Vol. I of VI), with the intention of another five volumes to come. For singer David Archibald, who is by day professor of political cinemas at the University of Glasgow, the band offers a chance to tell history while also getting people onto the dancefloor. \"We create these songs that are political and philosophical but we want people to dance at the same time and have fun,\" he explains. \"We want people to dance to radical history. We don t see a barrier between having a good time and thinking about the world at the same time.\" Julia Bauer David says his songs are often inspired by walking around Glasgow The band's own history owes a debt to the likes of Marc Bolan and David Bowie. David was previously involved with the Glasgow Glam Rock Dialogues, an onstage debate in which he and others would dig out the glitter and discuss serious world issues while dressed up as glam rock stars. The unusual idea proved popular, and after several performances - and guest appearances from the likes of Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos and Bob Hardy - David decided to fuse his passions of music and history in another way. \"We decided to explore what if a rock band tried to tell the history of a city   what would it sound like? \"My feet are at the heart of the songs, or at least my body is. A lot of them come from walking around the city and just encountering things. \"We have one foot in higher education, and one foot in Glasgow s vibrant music scene. It's the rock band that drives it though - the music determines where the band has got to go.\" Getty Images The Spanish Civil War saw a number of Scots head abroad to join the conflict, like this ambulance unit Where the group go is all across the city, for both good and bad. David points out he never wanted the group to fall into becoming a twee \"I belong to Glasgow\" type of act, so their songs try and reflect all aspects of the Dear Green Place. For example, A Passion Flower s Lament deals with the Scots who went to the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. \"One of them was a young Glasgow University chemistry student who fought in Spain and was killed in quite murky circumstances,\" explains David. \"Civil wars are dirty, difficult things and it talks about the complexity of that, but also asks if we should we even worry about that when fascists are coming back.\" Getty Images One Tenementals song imagines Glasgow as seen through an owl in the sky Other songs touch upon people executed or deported for their part in the Radical Wars uprising in 1820 while The Owl of Minerva imagines an airborne trip across the whole city, through the eyes of an owl taking flight from Finnieston Crane. \"There are things that have scarred this city and affected it negatively, there are positive things, there are things that are both at the same time. \"We want to understand the complexities of this city and grapple with it.\" The political songs of the Specials were an influence on David The formula has brought them success both at home and abroad. Earlier in 2024 they supported Belle & Sebastian at the veteran indie-pop band's homecoming shows in the city, while their version of German protest song  Die Moorsoldaten/Peat Bog Soldiers  was placed in the archives of a concentration camp where it was known to have been sung. Actress Maxine Peake also asked the group to perform at the the Working Class Movement Library in Salford. \"I think there s a massive thirst for people who have ideas about things,\" says David. \"You don t have to agree with what we re saying in order to engage with it. \"If the songs weren t good then the project would fall on its rear end, but there s an interest there. \"When I was a kid I was politicalised by music like the Jam and the Clash and the Specials. \"When the Specials were on Top of the Pops we d be at rallies yelling 'black and white unite' to fight against fascism. \"There is scope for more political acts   you re seeing that now in Ireland with bands like Kneecap.\" Julia Bauer Olivia McLean adds cello to the Tenementals sound.",

Swathes of the city were rebuilt after the war An exhibition is telling the story of life in Hull after the destruction of World War Two. The Half Life of the Blitz, at Hull History Centre, explains how the city has evolved over the past 80 years. Martin Taylor, the city archivist, said wartime bombing changed Hull \"like nothing else in its history\". \"The resilience which Hull citizens showed in the face of Nazi aggression was also applied as they rebuilt the city on their own terms,\" he added. German bombing raids on Hull killed 1,200 people, injured 3,000 and made more than 150,000 homeless. About 87,000 houses were damaged. The city was rebuilt over the following decades, though scars remain today, including a ruined cinema, which is being turned into an education centre and memorial site. The exhibition has been created by the University of Lincoln and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Historians Dr James Greenhalgh and Dr Charlotte Tomlinson interviewed Hull people to build a picture of how the city sees itself and remembers its past. The National Picture Theatre, which has been unused since it was bombed in 1941, is being turned into a heritage site Councillor Rob Pritchard, portfolio holder for culture and leisure at Hull City Council, said the exhibition provided a \"fascinating insight into post-war Hull up until the present day\" and would be \"of interest to anyone who is proud of our city\". The exhibition will run until 31 January. Admission is free. It is open Tuesday to Thursday between 09:30 and 16:30 GMT, as well as on the first and third Saturday of each month from 09:30 to 12:30. Dr Greenhalgh will give a talk about the post-war development of Hull   and the multitude of plans, schemes and projects that sought to remake the city   at the history centre on 14 January at 12:30.

        "content": "Welsh sailor's heroic role in grisly shipwreck 8 December 2024 Share Save Neil Prior BBC News Share Save Illustrated London News Thomas Lewis, seen here in a drawing from 1875, was known locally as Twm Pen-Stryd, which loosely translates as Tom, Top of the Street One hundred and fifty years ago Able Seaman Thomas Lewis became the hero of one of the most grisly shipwrecks in British maritime history - which included drowning, fire and even cannibalism. In the autumn of 1874 Twm Pen-Stryd, as he was known locally, from Moelfre on Anglesey, was serving onboard the Cospatrick, transporting emigrant labourers and cargo to New Zealand. On the night of 17 November, off the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa, an uncontrollable fire broke out on the wooden sailing ship, resulting in all but three of the 479 passengers and crew losing their lives. Yet had it not been for Twm's experience - including urging them to drink the blood of those who had already died - not even those survivors would have made it back to Britain to tell the tale after ten days adrift in a lifeboat. National Library of New Zealand A photograph of the Cospatrick taken at Gravesend before it set sail for New Zealand in September 1874 Twm - whose nickname loosely translates as Tom, Top of the Street - was born into a fishing and seafaring community in 1828, one of seven children. In his 1976 book, The Survival of Twn Pen-Stryd, RR Williams wrote that Twm's father was blind, a possible reason for the necessity for his son to go to sea and provide income for the family. Whatever his motives for leaving, when Twm returned from the Cospatrick disaster aged 46 it was said to be only his second visit home in 25 years. Williams added that little is known about Twm's early life and sea-going career, although he did mention serving in the Navy as a young man. \"It is hinted, too, in some newspapers of the period that he had served with Belgian crews in foreign ships, and that as a Welsh speaker, he had acquired a mixture of Welsh and Flemish accents when conversing in the English language,\" Williams wrote. David Lloyd Owen / RR Williams RR Williams' book, The Survival of Twm Pen-Stryd, was published in 1976 In the 1870s an agricultural depression gripped rural Britain, in-part due to a run of wet summers and poor harvests, but also cheaper shipping costs and the dropping of tariffs. As a result, huge quantities of grain were imported from the newly settled North American Prairies and the Steppes of Russia, undercutting Britain's farmers. New Zealand became attractive around this time as it was actively encouraging new settlers with assisted or free passage. In contrast with the convict voyages to Australia, the Cospatrick was comparatively comfortable, with an A1 safety certificate and good food and accommodation for the passengers. But Rhodri Clark, the editor of the Welsh history website History Points who has researched Twm and the disaster, believes the Cospatrick may not have been as welcoming as the owners wanted people to believe. \"The Board of Trade inquiry into the Cospatrick found the likely cause of the fire was passengers breaking into the hold at night in search of booze, lighting their way with an open candle,\" he said. \"It seems they got far more than they were bargaining on, as the cargo also contained highly flammable straw, palm and linseed oil, and materials like turpentine, paraffin, paint, candles and varnish, with tons of coal nearby.\" Mr Clark - who has installed a QR code on the site of a former shop in Moelfre bearing Twm's name, as well as an audio description of the story on its website - added that there were only six lifeboats, with a maximum capacity of 187, available to the almost 500 onboard. \"Incredibly Cospatrick was awarded an A1 safety certificate because her six lifeboats met the rules of the day, which determined the number, not by the amount of passengers, but by the overall tonnage of the ship.\" This rule would not be changed until the sinking of the Titanic almost 40 years later, he added. Illustrated London News A drawing of the Cospatrick ablaze Twm's heroics began immediately after the fire broke out, manning the water pumps and braving the flames and smoke long after many of his fellow officers had abandoned their posts. He was finally forced to flee for his life as the blaze became unmanageable - although his actions had allowed dozens to get away. Of the six lifeboats, four were destroyed in the fire, an overloaded fifth capsized, leaving only one upright and manoeuvrable. Twm and his two eventual fellow survivors   Second Mate Henry MacDonald and Ordinary Seaman Edward Cotter, just 18   swam across to right the upturned boat, helping the 62 people who had made it off. Without food, water and with broken oars, they drifted for 10 days, powerless to respond to the cries for help from those still aboard the stricken Cospatrick. Second Mate MacDonald was glowing in his praise of Twm at the 1875 inquiry. \"Thomas Lewis gave Peter Cope, the ship's baker, his dungaree over-trousers, as he was nearly naked, and that was typical of his conduct throughout our ordeal. \"When other men were floundering, he discovered the inner strength to do what was necessary,\" he said. With just a handful still alive, Twm was the first to make the grim suggestion that they had to drink the blood and eat the livers of those who had already died. Illustrated London News An 1875 illustration of the survivors Henry MacDonald (top centre), Edward Cotter (bottom left), Thomas Lewis (bottom right) Twm told the inquiry: \"I unsheathed my knife, and placing the sharp point on the wrist of one of the dead men, I made a deep incision. I quickly bent low over the bleeding wrist, and drank his blood.\" He said he also urged two others to \"follow suit if they were ever to see home again\". \"I then cut out the livers of the two dead, and distributed the pieces to others on board... After this the bodies were delivered to the sea.\" Finally, on their 10th day adrift, they were spotted by the British Sceptre, an iron sailing vessel heading to Dundee from Calcutta. Two of the five still alive at that point died on their way to St Helena, in the middle of the Atlantic, but Twm, MacDonald and Cotter eventually made it back to Britain on New Year's Eve 1874. Mr Clark said Twm was already volunteering for the Moelfre lifeboat less than a month after returning, including being \"involved in a significant rescue\" a few days before going to London for the inquiry. historypoints.org Thomas Lewis is buried at St Allgo Churchyard in Llanallgo, Anglesey",

        "content": "The photo of two men standing on a mountain of bison skulls is well known as a symbol of hunting during the colonisation of the US. But there's a more sinister story behind it   with a surprising modern message. Two men in black suits and bowler hats pose with a gravity-defying mound of bison skulls. The 19th-Century image is disturbing   thousands upon thousands of skulls piled in neat rows, towering towards the sky. But beneath the macabre first impression, the photo holds a darker secret still. These skulls aren't just the product of overzealous hunting in the US   and those men aren't hunters, either. The skulls, experts say, are the evidence of an organised, carefully calculated campaign to eradicate the bison, deprive Native Americans of a vital resource, and drive the few communities that survived onto small reservations where they could be controlled by the newly arrived white settlers. \"This image is an example of colonial celebration of destruction,\" says Tasha Hubbard, a Cree filmmaker who is an associate professor at the Faculty of Native Studies at the University of Alberta in Canada. Hubbard describes the extermination of the bison as a \"strategic\" part of colonial expansion. The eradication of the animal \"was seen as the taming of the West, of domesticating this wild space that was needed in order for expansion of settlement\". The colonial mass slaughter of bison dealt a lasting blow to tribes that relied on the animal for sustenance. In the aftermath, nations reliant on bison fared measurably, permanently worse than nations that were never bison-reliant, for example suffering from higher child mortality than those other nations, according to a comparative study. The study concludes that the loss set the bison nations on a fundamentally different trajectory that continues to this day.",

Experts state the skulls are evidence of an organized campaign to strategically eradicate bison, rather than just overzealous hunting. This campaign aimed to deprive Native Americans of a vital resource, force them onto reservations, facilitate colonial expansion, and inflicted lasting harm on bison-reliant tribes.",

Dr Eva Namusoke spent 15 months liaising with University of Cambridge librarians, curators and archivists, as well as delving into their stores, to uncover the items. It \"is fairly common\" for large museums not to display most of their collections, but it was \"still surprising to see this scale and diversity from the entire African continent and some there for decades and decades\", she said. The project is the latest in recent work at the university to tackle questions about its museums' relationship with colonisation and enslavement and reveals the majority of artefacts were acquired during British colonisation. University Library This recipe for a medieval narcotic cough syrup is one of 200,000 manuscripts or books found at a Cairo synagogue and brought back to Cambridge, making it part of the world's largest collection of medieval Jewish manuscripts Dr Namusoke, the Fitzwilliam Museum's senior curator African Collections Future, said the majority of the Africa-related artefacts are not on display and she hopes they will now be more widely shared and researched. They were found in the stores and archives of the eight museums and the Botanic Garden which together make up the University of Cambridge Museums, as well as the University Library and less-well known collections in university departments and institutions. They range from Maasai [tribe] armlets donated by a colonial administrator, a small mammal collected in a Boer War (1899-1902) concentration camp, a collection of medieval Jewish manuscripts and early photographs of African people. The connection with British colonisation University Museum of Zoology A spring hare collected in South Africa in 1901, during the Boer War, a bitter colonial war between the British Empire and Afrikaans-speaking Boer farmers The majority of the artefacts were acquired during British colonisation, some gifted, bought, commissioned or excavated - while others were stolen, confiscated or looted. The Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology has a gold necklace from Ghana which is thought to have been looted from Asantehene Kofi Karikari s palace during the Third Anglo-Asante War of 1873-4, while there are 116 objects linked to the British-led punitive campaign and looting of the Benin Kingdom in 1897, in present-day southern Nigeria. Dr Namusoke said: \"I was prepared to find material like this, as it is the case in a lot of museums around the world.\" Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology Looted during another colonial war, the necklace was later purchased in London by a Girton College, Cambridge graduate and donated to the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology She said the 19th Century scientific method of collecting and colonisation \"went very much hand in hand\". \"The university holds dodo skeleton bones because of a personal relationship between someone in Cambridge and the colonial administrator in Mauritius,\" she said. \"There is a development with anthropology and the administration of colonies, meaning researchers have the framework to study and research the people and their culture.\" Uncovering African labour and expertise Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology African people shared valuable knowledge, worked as translators, tracked and hunted animals, prepared specimens and artefacts for travel among many other activities Dr Namusoke's report notes how \"frustratingly little\" there is recorded about the skills, expertise and local knowledge deployed by African workers in gathering the specimens or artefacts. \"There's an example I give from Cameroon from the 1930s where it is clear there is a huge amount of African labour involved,\" she said. \"They tracked and hunted the animals, including Cameroonian men lying on their stomachs for hours on end with test tubes to gather spiders and snails. \"It was absolutely about using local labour and expertise, their intellectual, physical and creative labour. \"The focus has been on the European scientists who did the collecting not the labour that made it possible.\" Report findings at a glance The Fitzwilliam Museum Tens of thousands archaeological objects from Egypt held by the Fitzwilliam and Archaeology and Anthropology museums have been intensely studied since the late 19th Century Egypt is the best represented African country in the university's collections, with tens of thousands of archaeological items and manuscripts The Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology has an estimated 137,000 items, but fewer than 1% is on display It also cares for more than 29,000 photographs, including early images of African people from the 1860s About 100,000 African specimens are held at the Museum of Zoology, while the Herbarium (containing preserved plants) has the least well-researched collection The Duckworth Laboratory cares for about 4,800 ancient human remains from Egypt and 1,200 from Sudan, but there is there is little documentation on how some 750 other African remains were collected Museum of Zoology The report is an introduction to the university's African collections but is not comprehensive The project is part of Collections-Connections-Communities, a research initiative at the University of Cambridge.

        "content": "The havoc and bloodshed caused by the Korean War had begun six months earlier. In the years leading up to the end of World War Two, Korea had suffered under a brutal Japanese occupation. The US proposed to its wartime ally, the Soviet Union, that following Japan's surrender, they should temporarily divide control of Korea between them. The thought was that it would help them manage the removal of the Japanese forces. In 1945, the superpowers split the country in two along an arbitrary demarcation line, the 38th parallel. The Soviets supported Kim Il-sung in the north's Democratic People's Republic of Korea while the US backed Syngman Rhee in the Republic of Korea in the south. From the outset, neither of the newly-created Korean governments accepted the other's legitimacy or the demarcation line. \"It was never considered in any sense by Koreans to be legitimate or meaningful. It was completely meaningless to them,\" Dr Owen Miller of the Centre of Korean Studies at SOAS, University of London, told the BBC History Magazine podcast in 2024. Both leaders wanted to reunify the country by force. By 1949, the two superpowers had withdrawn most of their occupying troops from Korea, but it did little to ease the simmering tensions. Increasingly bloody clashes regularly broke out along the de facto border. On 25 June 1950, North Korea's communist leader Kim Il-sung made his move. In the early hours of morning, he launched a surprise attack with a well-trained fighting force across the 38th parallel. The North Korean troops, equipped with Soviet weapons, quickly overwhelmed the Republic of Korea's army. Within days they had captured the south's capital Seoul, forcing many of its residents to swear allegiance to the Communist Party or face imprisonment or execution. In the US, President Truman was caught off guard by the speed and success of North Korea's assault. A believer in the \"Domino theory\"   that if one country fell to communism others would follow   he appealed to the newly-formed UN to defend South Korea. The Soviet Union could have vetoed this vote. But at the time, it was boycotting the UN Security Council because of its refusal to admit the People's Republic of China. And so, on 28 June 1950, a resolution was passed calling on all UN member states to help repel the invasion. MacArthur, the US general who had accepted Japan's surrender at the end of World War Two, was named commander of the combined UN force. Turning the tide The US was the first to respond, hurriedly sending its soldiers stationed in Japan. But these troops were ill-prepared to contend with the superior North Korean forces that swept rapidly down the country, pushing them back. As the battles raged, thousands of ordinary Korean civilians caught up in the conflict were killed. By September, the South Korean and UN forces were pinned down, defending a small enclave around the port of Busan on the southern tip. North Korea looked to be on the brink of reuniting the entire Korean peninsula.",

It's an argument which goes beyond the hundreds of millions it will cost to rebuild. There have also been concerns over publicly funding a facility which bears the name of an Irish rebel, executed for high treason. But who was Roger Casement? His story is told in a new BBC Sounds podcast series, The Mystery Of: Casement, Rebel Knight. PA Media Casement Park's redevelopment will no longer be done to UEFA specifications, reducing its cost dramatically Knight of the Realm Roger was a Dublin boy, the son of a British Army officer. The family moved to County Antrim when he was a teenager, where he attended the school which is now Ballymena Academy. He left at 15 to begin work in the office of a shipping line in Liverpool. That job led him to work on one of the company's ships transporting goods to and from the Congo River in West Africa. A job with the International African Association established by the Belgian King, Leopold II would follow. Patrick Casement, the great grandson of Roger's second cousin, still lives in the family home and has kept records of letters written by Roger during his time in Africa. \"He was driven in a way, and you get that sense from his incessant letter writing,\" said Patrick. Portrait of Roger Casement Roger writes of his inability to ignore the terrible treatment of the locals, who were exploited by the Europeans. \"He had seen evidence of maltreatment and atrocities before we went up into the rubber plantations, but I think what he saw there shifted his whole view of the colonial experience,\" Patrick said. \"It was a turning point in his life.\" Roger later worked for the British Consular Service and in 1903 produced a damning report into atrocities he witness in the Congo. His exposing of human rights abuses earned him not only international renown and a knighthood, but also a bitter resentment of colonial powers which would eventually lead him to the gallows. Dr Reuben Loffman, from Queen Mary University of London, says Roger deserves to be remembered for \"taking African voices seriously\". Rebellion Despite being knighted in 1911, Roger had a pivotal role in founding the Irish Volunteers, and publicly canvased for donations as part of the groups bid to end British rule in Ireland. In an attempt to capitalise on Britain's conflict with Germany during World War I, he was a principal organiser in the purchase of weapons which were to be shipped from Hamburg. Roger, along with fellow rebels Robert Monteith and Daniel Julian Bailey, was ferried back to the coastal waters off Ireland aboard a German u-boat. They made their way ashore in a small rowing boat with rifles to be supplied to the armed rebellion known as the Easter Rising. The rising was ultimately a military failure and Roger's involvement led to his conviction for high treason. Some of the weapons were retrieved from the seabed and presented as evidence at his trial. On 3 August 1916 Roger was hanged in London. A divided legacy PA Media Supporters of the Northern Ireland football team held banners against Casement Park's redevelopment",

The 43mm-long (1.7in) ear-cleaning device was found by a metal detectorist in a field near King's Lynn, Norfolk, in July. County finds liaison officer Helen Geake said scoops were \"really, really hard to date\", but a line of dots punched along its \"barley twist\" handle suggested to her it is later medieval rather than from the earlier Roman period in Britain. Just 20 silver ear scoops have been recorded on the Portable Antiquities website since it was created more than 25 years ago, making it a rare find, she added. \"For comparison with other medieval silver items, there are 1,200 brooches, 1,200 finger rings and 29 pins on the database,\" Dr Geake said. The items are rarely found in an archaeological context, which is what makes dating them challenging. Dr Geake said: \"The Roman ones are quite similar, but this one has a characteristic medieval design of a line of dots made using a punch and, unlike Roman ones, does not have a suspension loop.\" The find, which is part-gilt, has been dated to about 1350-1400, during the reigns of Edward III and Richard II. It has a tiny scoop at one end, while the other end has been flattened and Dr Geake suggested that might be used for cleaning under nails. The coroner has opened an inquest into the item.

Unfolding in the afternoon after the executions, Potter insists that they weren't quite as brutal as the Gladiator films and other Roman epics would have you believe. To begin with, they weren't all slaves or prisoners of war. \"Forty per cent of the gladiators were probably free people who became gladiators to make money,\" says Potter. Rather than it being a fight to the death, Belonick compares these contests to watching WWE or UFC. \"Most of the time it's to first blood or a moment of surrender. It was once calculated that nine out of 10 times nobody dies.\" There was even a referee that stepped in to separate people. That didn't stop citizens from betting on the gladiators, with Potter adding that Romans would gamble on anything. When somebody got injured, prestigious doctors would come out to treat them. Galen, the most famous doctor from the ancient world, even started out as a doctor for gladiators. Ultimately, the goal of the gladiator contests was to see different styles of combat pitted against each other. \"There'd be a guy with a net and triton against someone with a shield and sword,\" says Potter. \"Someone lightly armoured against someone in heavy armour\". Aidan Monaghan The film's depictions of gladiator fights are largely incorrect   they were more regulated, less gruesome and with fewer fatalities (Credit: Aidan Monaghan) Much like its approach to the Colosseum games, several of the characters involved in Gladiator II were based on real people, but what happens to them in the film is fiction. In 211 AD, Caracalla and Geta became the joint rulers of Rome. Caracella is then believed to have had Geta murdered. Geta is even thought to have died in their mother's arms. Caracalla became a hugely unpopular emperor, with Potter describing him as a \"vicious and nasty man\". Caracalla left the city in 216 AD to wage war against the Parthian Empire, only to be murdered by one of his own soldiers in 217 AD. Macrinus allegedly recruited the soldier to commit the murder. He became the Emperor of Rome on 11 April 217, three days after Caracalla's death. \"He's the first person to become emperor who'd never been a member of the Roman Senate,\" says Potter. Macrinus himself was executed just over a year later, in June 218, after Caracella's aunt had launched a rebellion to get her grandson, Elagabalus, installed as the new emperor, even though he was just 14. \"Being emperor becomes the most dangerous job you could possibly have,\" says Potter, and for the next 100 years every person who reigned only did so for a short time.",

        "content": "The drama and farce of the Baker Street bank heist 17 November 2024 Share Save Bethan Bell BBC News Share Save Getty Images The tunnel into Lloyds Bank was described in court as \"a remarkable piece of engineering\" In the autumn of 1971, a group of men came together who would carry out one of the most astonishing bank raids in history. Skill, audacity and patience, criminal connections, a fair amount of luck, and inspiration from a Sherlock Holmes story culminated in a weekend of high drama and barely believable farce. A weekend in which a gang tunnelled into a secure vault and made off with the contents of hundreds of secure deposit boxes, while all the time being listened to by an amateur radio operator who was trying to tune in to Radio Luxembourg. A weekend in which police officers were on one side of the vault's door while the gang were on the other, and nobody thought to check inside. As Lloyds Bank announces the upcoming closure of its Baker Street branch in central London, this is the story of how one of the most secure locations in the country was plundered - and even now, remains partly unsolved. An archive news report from 1971, featuring a youthful John Humphrys On a Friday night in September 1971, a group of men, clutching sandwiches and flasks of tea, made their way into SAC, a leather goods shop on Baker Street. The previous May, the lease for the shop came up for sale and was duly bought by Benjamin Wolfe, a man in his 60s. He had been especially keen on the premises because it was two doors down from Lloyds Bank and it had a basement the same depth as the bank's vault. Before even that, in December 1970, an apparently well-to-do man opened an account at the Baker Street branch of Lloyds and put  500 (about  6,000 today) into it. Later, he rented a safety deposit box at the branch. Like many wealthy clients, he made frequent visits to his box in the vault. Unlike many wealthy clients, he used the time to measure the room with his umbrella. Other circumstances played into the hands of the group. The summer had seen a number of roadworks in the area. The vibrations caused by the work led to businesses' trembler alarms repeatedly going off. So the businesses disabled their trembler alarms. Getty Images Detectives and uniformed officers went to inspect the interior of the bank after staff found the vault in a \"state of some disorder\" Originally thought to have been organised by a Brian Reader, who was later involved in both the Brinks-Mat heist and the Hatton Garden raid, the personnel of the gang has never been fully established. Reader, who died aged 84 last year with an estimated fortune of  22m garnered from his string of high-risk burglaries, denied he took part. Four people, including Wolfe and Anthony Gavin, a prot g  of Reader's, were jailed in 1973. It's thought at least another four, including a woman, slipped away. Getty Images The lease of the leather goods shop SAC was bought by one of the gang Other unanswered questions include how much was taken. It was reported that it could be anything between  500,000 and  3m (today's equivalent of  6m and  40m). Only a fraction was recovered, and the rest went untracked. There were rumours involving government suppression of the story, for reasons unknown. And records about it officially sealed at the national archives until 2071. And is there any truth to the claim that one box contained photographs of Princess Margaret in an intimate clinch? Getty Images If police had looked into the leather goods shop on the night they were called out, they would have found a tunnel into the bank's vault Gavin allegedly came up with the scheme after reading a Sherlock Holmes story, The Red-Headed League. In it, Arthur Conan-Doyle's hero waits in a vault for burglars planning to tunnel in. Alongside Wolfe, Gavin recruited Reginald Tucker (who was the umbrella-wielder) and Thomas Stephen. Two others, Bobby Mills and Mickey Gervaise, were thought to be on board - although afterwards they disappeared into \"thin air\", the police investigation found. Getty Images Police removed more than 800 items of evidence, a trial heard Tea flasks and sandwiches were not the only items carted inside the leather shop. Stephen, recruited for his ability to provide the necessary tools, had produced a 100-tonne jack, explosives, and a thermal lance, which heats and melts steel with pressurized oxygen to create very high temperatures. Months of weekends were spent digging the 40ft tunnel, with debris being taken away in plastic boxes under cover of darkness. When it was time for the raid, Mills, furnished with a walkie-talkie, mounted a nearby roof to keep an eye out as the others went through the tunnel and worked on breaking into the vault. The jack didn't work, and nor did the thermal lance. It would have to be the gelignite. Timing the explosion to coincide with traffic to conceal the noise, they managed to break through. They were in. Getty Images Police check the alarm that didn't sound as the burglars burrowed into the bank Meanwhile, in his attempt to tune into Radio Luxembourg, Robert Rowlands was picking up the gang's walkie-talkie conversations on his ham radio. The 35-year-old was listening to them in real time as they co-ordinated their movements and the rooftop lookout beefed about how cold he was. Mr Rowlands heard the group discuss whether to take a break as their exploits had left the vault full of fumes, smoke and dust. One tunneller requested a cup of tea and a sandwich. They also mentioned how many \"thousands\" they had and what they would go back for. Mr Rowlands assumed they were burgling a tobacco shop and the numbers referred to cigarettes. Local police were not interested. A few hours later Mr Rowlands called Scotland Yard, where detectives were indeed interested. They called in a detection van from the Post Office in an attempt to trace the walkie-talkie signal. But they didn't do this until Sunday afternoon, when it was all over. Getty Images The bank manager, who was \"roused from his bed\" the previous night, explained to customers the branch was shut The Times reported the following day: \"Bank managers and caretakers were roused from their beds and brought from weekend holiday retreats to open their premises. \"Police, accompanied by security men, went into the bank, but after being assured that the strong room was intact, they left. \"As they closed the front door of the Lloyds premises, the thieves, some of them crouching behind the strong room doors, breathed a sigh of relief. \"The slightest gasp might have given away their position. \"Soon afterwards the thieves crawled back along the 40ft tunnel. They escaped through a back window leaving eight tons of rubble from the tunnel behind.\" Or, as bank staff said, with remarkable understatement when they opened the branch on Monday morning: \"We found the vault in some disorder.\" Getty Images Police and news reporters gathered outside the branch on Baker Street Cdr Robert Huntley, of Scotland Yard, said: \"Inevitably, we have come in for some criticism, from people who say we were slow to move off the mark. \"When we were able to visit the bank with Lloyds security staff we were assured that the strong room was still intact. No one suspected that the gang had come up through the floor on the other side.\" It was the biggest robbery ever carried out in the Metropolitan Police district, with 120 detectives working on the case. \"We are getting information about who are the real brains behind this gang\", Cdr Hunt said. \"We think that the 'Mr Big' is probably a faceless commuter. I do not know him.\" Getty Images Robert Rowlands, left, raised the alarm after picking up the gang's walkie-talkie conversations on his ham radio Gavin - whose tunnel-digging was described at the Old Bailey as \"a magnificent piece of engineering\" - Tucker and Stephen all pleaded guilty to entering the bank as a trespasser, stealing cash and jewellery and possessing explosives. Wolfe was found guilty of the same charges. Passing sentence, Judge Sutcliffe QC, said: \"Each one of you must have known that the reward for success would be very high and the penalty for failure would be high as well.\" Wolfe was given eight years in jail, while the others received 12. Judge Sutcliffe told Wolfe he was passing a lesser sentence on him only because of his great age. \"I am not going to have on my conscience the sentencing of a man for so long that he has little chance of leaving prison alive.\" (Wolfe was 64). Getty Images The bank will close on 6 January, Lloyds said The aftermath of the case saw an undignified bout of finger-pointing. Scotland Yard said it was let down by the security staff of Lloyds Bank, who in turn said they had been assured their alarms were \"foolproof\". The Post Office complained it could have caught the gang if it had been called in earlier. There were also questions as to why police did not check the leather shop, which would not only have revealed the tunnel leading straight into the vault, but the men inside, busily opening 286 safety deposit boxes. Getty Images The tunnel started inside the SAC shop and ran underground to the bank The heist was the inspiration for a 2008 film, The Bank Job. It includes a plotline in which the British Security Services want to retrieve some compromising photographs of Princess Margaret, allegedly held in a security box by Trinidadian militant gangster Michael X. The obvious solution was to get a gang to tunnel into the vault. The storyline boosted a rumour that appeared in newspapers, in which an anonymous \"friend\" said Reader was definitely involved in the heist and had told him he found photos showing a leading politician abusing children. Reader apparently left the images \"scattered on the floor of the vault\" for the police to find. There has been no evidence this was true. Another rumour was that the government imposed a \"D-notice\" - now called a DSMA-notice - on the story. This hinges on a lack of coverage of the story, with many claiming it disappeared from the news agenda. A DSMA-notice is issued to prevent inadvertent public disclosure of information that would compromise UK military and intelligence operations. It is not usually used to silence news stories about bank jobs that have already happened. The lack of published stories, though, isn't quite true. Naturally, interest died down, but the raid was still being reported in national and regional papers throughout the decade. The rumour may have started with radio ham Mr Rowlands, who said police had snatched a phone out of his grasp while he spoke to a newspaper about his part in the case. He said the officer had told the editor he was not allowed to publish anything. Years later, Mr Rowlands suggested the police were trying to cover up what appeared to be their own incompetence. The only mystery that remains is what is in the 800 pages of sealed documents at the National Archives. They are due to be released in 47 years time. So what did Lloyds Bank say about the whole event? It advised customers to insure valuables kept in their safety boxes and denied any liability. After all, it said: \"It is a little unusual for raiders to come up through the floor.\"",
        "target_summary": "In September 1971, a gang tunneled into the vault of a Lloyds Bank branch on Baker Street, London, stealing valuables from hundreds of secure deposit boxes. An amateur radio operator overheard the thieves' walkie-talkie communications and alerted police, who initially failed to investigate the tunnel's origin in an adjacent leather goods shop, allowing the gang to escape undetected. Four individuals were later jailed for the \"remarkable piece of engineering,\" but much of the estimated £500,000 to £3 million taken was never recovered, and government records about the heist remain sealed until 2071.",

Tamworth Castle, which was home to Mercian kings before the Normans re-built it in the 11th Century, is one of 13 West Midlands sites added to the register and is one of the best-preserved motte-and-bailey castles in England. Also at risk is the Grade II*-listed Kings Norton Old Grammar School in Birmingham, which was the winner of BBC2's Restoration Live, in 2004. In total, there are 399 entries on the Heritage at Risk Register in the West Midlands in 2024, Historic England (HE) said, having allocated  1.1m to be used for repairs. The full list covers the whole of England, which HE says provides a snapshot of the health of properties and places across the country considered to be important. Tamworth Castle has featured in the paintings of J.M.W Turner, the writings of Sir Walter Scott, and has entertained visitors as a museum since 1899, HE said. It has been added to the list because structural instability has left it in need of extensive repairs. The school in Kings Norton also has a rich history having, among other things, survived an arson attack in 1913. Historic England Kings Norton Old Grammar School, which dates back to the early 15th Century, is thought to have originally been a priest's house, before remodelling in the 17th Century saw it used for education While Emmeline Pankhurst was on trial at the Old Bailey that year, her supporters had set fire to buildings around the country in protest, and the school was one they targeted. The following morning however, a note was found on a blackboard, which read: \"Two Suffragists have entered here, but charmed with this old-world room, have refrained from their design of destruction.\" In the West Midlands however, there are 12 sites that HE now lists as having been saved. Historic England The Hunningham Bridge, near Leamington Spa, has been restored and is now considered not to be at risk, after extensive repairs following a series of crashes, that left it partially demolished This includes Hunningham Bridge, in Warwickshire, after two collisions in 2015 left it partially demolished, with another crash by a farm vehicle in August, causing more damage. However, repairs and new measures to prevent repeat incidents mean the bridge is no longer on the at-risk list, HE said. Also considered safe is Ecton Copper Mine in Staffordshire, which was once the most advanced and deepest mining site in the country. This year saw the conclusion of nearly two decades of repair works, meaning it can be removed from the at risk register. Historic England Ellesmere Boatyard is another of the historic sites which has been added to the list Also at risk is Grade II* listed Ellesmere Boatyard in Shropshire which was established in 1806 and is the UK s oldest operational canal-yard. Today, it serves as a home of the Canal & River Trust charity. It was added to the at-risk list because a Grade II* listed timber store and engine house is seen as being in immediate danger of decay.

Trustees of the Sir Percival David Foundation, which owns the works, are to donate 1,700 pieces following a 15-year loan to the London museum. The charitable foundation represents the late British businessman, who collected the items in Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and China, before his death in 1964. The director of the British Museum, Dr Nicholas Cullinan, said it was an \"incomparable private collection\". PA Media Detailed artwork from the Qing dynasty is included on some pieces The works have been on loan to the museum since 2009 and on show in the specially designed bilingual Room 95. Sir Percival David was born into a wealthy family in Bombay in 1892 and inherited a baronetcy from his father, as well as ownership of the family company. The businessman moved to London in 1914 from where he began to collect large amounts of Chinese art and books. Trustees of the Sir Percival David Foundation said he had wanted his private collection to be used to inform and inspire people. Dr Cullinan said he was \"humbled by the generosity of the trustees of the Sir Percival David Foundation\".

The collection also includes a chicken cup used to serve wine for the Chenghua emperor and Ru wares made for the Northern Song dynasty court around 1086. The chairman of The Sir Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art, Colin Sheaf, said the donation achieved Sir Percival's three main objectives. He said these were to: \"Preserve intact his unique collection, to keep every single piece on public display together, and to ensure the collection would remain an inspiration and education for future generations.\" PA Media This Jun stoneware dish is from the Northern Song dynasty, which was in place around the 11th and 12th centuries Arts minister Sir Chris Bryant added: \"I am thrilled these world-famous Chinese ceramics will now be displayed permanently in the British Museum, where the collection will educate and enlighten future generations for many years to come. \"I am immensely grateful for this phenomenal act of generosity and very much hope it will help set a trend for others.\" After the donation is completed, pieces will be lent to the Shanghai Museum in China and Metropolitan Museum in New York as part of the British Museum's support of exhibitions worldwide.

The listed lamps appear to have been taken at various times between about 13 September and 1 October from Jesus Lane, St John's Street and Trumpington Street, Cambridgeshire Police said.

Steve Hubbard/BBC A light was taken from the post outside the Fitzwilliam Museum Steve Hubbard/BBC One of the lanterns was stolen from the top of this post in St John's Street in the city The lamps in Cambridge were designed by architect Sir Albert Edward Richardson, who was commissioned to design bespoke new street lighting for the city in 1957, according to Historic England.

The silver was acquired by a man who worked for the China Navigation Company in Shanghai during the World War Two. The family's Chinese servants had hidden the vast silver collection for the duration of the war. Cotswold auctioneer Kinghams' associate director Matthew Lafite said it was \"amazing\" the the collection was hidden away during the war. \"Our vendor is a descendant of the original owner, and the collection was entirely unknown until this year,\" Mr Lafite added. The collection includes a sterling silver tea set, salver, and ewer, all with finely detailed dragon decoration, carried out by Shanghai silversmith Zeewo. Included are silver pedestal dishes, and two large presentation plaques. The majority of the pieces date to between 1900 and 1920. The collection s existence was only revealed to the vendor shortly before her father passed away earlier this year. He told her there was something in the attic, but he had not known how valuable the collection was.

A few of the original decorative stones from Old Sarum - now a heritage site on the edge of Salisbury - have been found in a wall near the city's current cathedral.

Salisbury Cathedral was founded at its current position in 1220 and took decades to build as it is today. The move was due to unhappiness with the Old Sarum site - such as poor water supply - and disagreements with those at the castle there. Local myth tells that the current position was picked when an archer shot an arrow and where it landed, the build would be.

Mabel Wulff from Newport lived in Nazi Germany - surviving years of Gestapo harassment and bravely fighting fires caused by falling bombs. The plaque says the St Thomas   Becket Anglican Church, known as simply \"the English church\" for many years, would have been destroyed without her - after she hid its artwork to save it from damage and smothered fires as they started. She also sheltered people to save their lives. \"She s a part of history - Newport history and Hamburg history,\" says Eddie Wulff, Mabel s grandson who has spent the past few years trying to learn more about his grandmother s life. \"But very few in Wales seem to know about it. She was formidable.\" Eddie Wulff, 82, believes his grandmother Mabel's actions should be remembered It is a story that begins in Newport in 1909 when seamstress Mabel Phillips married Max Wulff, a German sailor. They couldn t have imagined the difficulties ahead, with Max setting up a restaurant on Alexandra Road in the Pill area of the city and the couple welcoming two sons in 1911 and 1913. Eddie Wulff Max and Mabel Wulff met and fell in love in Newport But the family were separated, with Max seen as an enemy by the British government and sent to camps in Lancaster and on the Isle of Man. Eddie Wulff This photo shows the horse and carriage used for Max and Mabel's wedding on Alexandra Road in Pill Life for Mabel and her sons Edward and Leonard became difficult, says Eddie. \"There was a lot of anti German feeling in Newport. They asked Mabel whether she would divorce Max because he was a German - she refused to do that.\" It was a feeling Eddie himself remembers, being in school in Newport at the end of the 1940s, where he recalled being called \"Nazi\" and \"Gestapo\".  They must have had it even worse  he said. Sent back to Germany As soon as World War One ended, Max wasn t allowed to return to Newport but sent back to Germany, where his young family would soon join him.  They had so much hassle - every stage of their life had been hard,\" Eddie said. That became apparent again in 1930s Hamburg. By then Mabel was the caretaker of \"the English church\", a Church of England church originally established because of the trade links between the city and the UK. Eddie Wulff The English Church was rebuilt in the years after the war and reconsecrated as St Thomas a Becket Church in 1947 Once war broke out, an Anglican church with a British caretaker attracted numerous visits from the Gestapo. \"She said they really were nasty and they were strutting about. They were always looking for the Union flag and the British Legion flag which Mabel had hidden under the altar,\" Max said. \"They were bouncing about, asking where these things were - they were actually walking on top of them.\" Eddie Wulff Mabel returned the flag she'd hidden to the British Legion in Hamburg at the end of the war - it is still used to this day As a key port city, Hamburg was targeted by sustained bombing raids, most notably during Operation Gomorrah in 1943. In anticipation of this, Mabel hid and stored some of the beautiful paintings and engravings from the church, meaning they were saved from damage. Madeleine Res hr The painting above the altar, a copy of Raphael's Sistine Madonna dating back to 1838, was protected by Mabel during the War - it still hangs in the church. It seemed there was nothing she wouldn t do to protect the building during the raids, putting her life at risk.  She did put fires out, she went around and smothered them and got water and put them out on numerous occasions. She did save the church,\" said Eddie. Madeleine Res hr The church was badly damaged by bombings Mabel Wulff also let families, displaced by the bombings, shelter in the church - again drawing the attention of the Gestapo. \"She was a good person. You didn t mess with Mabel - she was formidable,\" Eddie recalls. Mabel was caretaker of the church for 40 years At the end of the war, Mabel brought out the union flag she had hidden under the altar and draped it over the church s balcony as British troops entered the city. Mabel s bravery was noted by Church of England officials in 1947, thanking her for the \"great personal danger\" she put herself in. In 1956 she was awarded a British Empire Medal for her actions.

        "content": "New study overturns story of brass bands' origins 30 October 2024 Share Save Katy Prickett BBC News, Cambridgeshire Share Save Reuters The military began to experiment with all-brass bands from the 1810s, and by the 1820s civilian brass bands were being created, many mentored by military veterans The story of the origins of Britain's brass bands needs to be rewritten in the light of new evidence linking it to the Napoleonic Wars, according to a researcher. It was previously believed the brass instrument groups began as a civilian and exclusively northern creation, with roots in industrial communities. Now the role of military veterans in popularising brass bands in the early 19th Century has been unearthed by University of Cambridge historian Dr Eamonn O'Keeffe. \"We already knew about their relationship with industrialisation, now we know that brass bands emerged from Britain's wars against Napoleon,\" he said. Brian Callingham Dr Eamonn O'Keeffe said his research overthrows the assumption brass bands were primarily a product of industrialisation Dr O'Keeffe was a teenager in Toronto, Canada, when he first became interested in the significance of military music during the Napoleonic Wars. \"I worked at a British fort from the war of 1812 and played the drum and fife in the summer to bring the site to life for visitors,\" he said. \"I then wanted to dig deeper - what was it for, who are the men and boys playing it and what did they do after they left the Army?\" Hundreds of military bands were set up in the Napoleonic Wars, which lasted almost continuously from 1793 to 1815, many in the Army and others in the home defence-based militia or volunteer units. Dr O'Keeffe, who is National Army Museum Junior Research Fellow at Queens' College, Cambridge, said: \"All of these units have buglers and trumpeters and full bands of music, they also play at concerts and in the streets and village squares. \"They are very much part of the auditory landscape of the time for people living in Britain, and this familiarity with military bands helps fuel the interest in amateur brass bands that we see developing in the decades after the Battle of Waterloo.\" National Army Museum Military bands were used to give \"pomp and pageantry\" to parades, by officers at their dinner parties and balls and were also enjoyed by the soldiers, said Dr O'Keeffe Dr O'Keeffe's research, published in the Historical Journal, revealed military regiments began to experiment with all-brass bands from the 1810s onwards, instead of a mix of woodwind and brass. By the late 1820s, brass bands started forming outside the military, but often mentored by veterans. One of the ex-military band leaders about whom he has discovered the most was James Sanderson, a Waterloo veteran, from Thrapston, Northamptonshire. \"He served in the British army in a cavalry regiment, so mounted on horseback, went on to become the trumpet-major of the 13th Light Dragoons and leaves the Army in the 1820s,\" said Dr O'Keeffe. In 1829, the Leamington Spa Courier reported that Sanderson's Warwick and Leamington Military Brass Band performed at a Waterloo anniversary parade in Warwick, while in July that year the Leicester Herald said his band played for up to 300 people at a village feast in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, inspiring a \"merry dance\". British Newspaper Archive James Sanderson, from Thrapston, was one of many veterans who used the musical skills acquired in military bands to help him \"survive and thrive\" after he left \"William Self is another great example: a veteran himself, he served in the West Norfolk Militia and then sets up the Norwich Brass Band in the early 1830s and leads other all-brass bands that are playing at elections,\" said Dr O'Keeffe. \"Every area likes to claim they're the best, but [the local newspapers] say this is one of the best bands.\" By the early 1830s, a brass band was also regularly playing in Abbey Gardens, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, alternating with the local militia band. The first named civilian band which he has identified was Colyton Brass Band, playing in Devon in 1828. Chester and Sunderland had civilian brass bands by 1829. Derby and Sidmouth, in Devon, had theirs by 1834. Weymouth Museum Many of the veterans performed in militia and civilian bands long after demobilisation, while others instructed and advised musicians By 1814, more than 20,000 instrumentalists were serving in uniform and, come demobilisation, the men and boys used their instrumental skills in a variety of civilian musical careers, as instructors, performers, composers and opera singers. During the nearly 20 years of the Napoleonic Wars there was \"a sense that no public occasion is complete without a band of music\", according to Dr O'Keeffe. \"In wartime, that's a military band and afterwards the demand continues and somebody needs to fill that gap - and very often, these military veterans are the ones who are entrepreneurial enough to see that,\" he said. The historian unearthed their stories in overlooked press reports, memoirs and regimental records. He argues his research overturns the assumption brass bands were primarily a product of industrialisation pioneered by working class performers and middle-class sponsors.  Soldiers returned from the Napoleonic wars amidst a severe economic recession and many suffered a great deal,  said Dr O'Keeffe. \"Here we see musicians using the skills they developed in the military to survive and often thrive.",
        "target_summary": "A new study by Dr. Eamonn O'Keeffe suggests that the origins of British brass bands are linked to the Napoleonic Wars and military veterans, rather than solely to civilian industrial communities. His research indicates that military regiments experimented with all-brass bands from the 1810s, and demobilized veterans then formed and mentored civilian brass bands from the late 1820s.

        "content": "Based on a bestselling novel by Robert Harris, the Oscar-tipped film imagines what goes on behind the scenes of the secretive process   complete with scheming, smearing and leaking. As rival factions of cardinals manoeuvre to elect the next pope, the US Cardinal Bellini (Stanley Tucci) rejects a suggestion that he use stolen documents to smear a rival. His decision is not entirely on moral grounds. \"I'd be the Richard Nixon of popes,\" he says, in a scene that captures the savvy plot, the wit and the colourful characters in Conclave. The film takes us behind the scenes of the secretive, ritualised process that happens in the Vatican after a pope dies, but it plays like a bracing, contemporary political thriller. Edward Berger, whose All Quiet on the Western Front (2022) won the Oscar for best international film, directs with great precision and fidelity to real-life conclaves, capturing an essential conflict: this ancient ritual now lands in the media-flooded 21st Century. That link between ancient and modern actually inspired Robert Harris's bestselling 2016 novel of the same name, the basis for the film. Harris tells the BBC that the idea came to him in 2013 while, in the midst of finishing his Cicero Trilogy of novels set in ancient Rome, he was watching news of the election of Pope Francis. Harris says: \"Just before the [new] Pope reveals himself on the balcony, the windows on either side fill up with the faces of the cardinal electors who've come to watch him. I looked at their faces, all elderly men, crafty, some very benign and holy, some looking quite cynical. And I thought, 'Oh my God, I'm looking at the Roman Senate.'\" He observed that \"an all-male ruling Senate had lived on, and these elderly men running everything was a direct link with the Roman Republic\". When he then started researching conclaves, he says, \"I just thought it was absolutely riveting, politics in the raw.\" Focus Features Conclave imagines the jockeying between different papal candidates, including the conservative Cardinal Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto) (Credit: Focus Features) In his Oscar-tipped performance, Ralph Fiennes centres the film and adds sincere spiritual heft as the fair-minded English Cardinal Lawrence, tasked with running the conclave even though his confidence in his own vocation is wavering. The story begins with the death of the Pope, and the film-makers did extensive research to mirror the authentic details of a conclave. The cardinals arrive from around the world and live in austere rooms in a dormitory-like building, Casa Santa Marta. Once the conclave begins, they are sequestered, surrendering their phones and other devices, shut off from internet access or any news of the outside world, and being sworn to secrecy. Elaborately, they vote in the Sistine Chapel, writing the name of a would-be pope on a slip of paper, which is then put on a silver plate and deposited in an urn. Voting continues day after day until a pope is elected. All true, except that film's Casa Santa Marta and Sistine Chapel were built in Rome's Cinecitta Studios.",

As the capital has increased in size and become more developed, community squares, allotments, botanical gardens and even zoos have been lost.

The replica is a copy of a solidus coin showing the emperor Honorius (AD393-423) on one side and a figure holding a banner with Christian symbols on the other. The late 5th to early 6th Century pendant was created at a time when Anglo-Saxons were pagans, which was \"slightly ironic\", said coin expert Adrian Marsden. The find was discovered in a field near Attleborough, Norfolk, in January 2023, and has been declared treasure by a coroner. Adrian Marsden Numismatist Adrian Marsden thinks it belonged to someone with \"quite a bit of wealth\" and may have been part of the owner's grave goods Dr Marsden, from the Norfolk Historic Environment Service, said this was an era when the Roman Empire, which had become officially Christian by AD380, was \"in freefall\". \"We know the Anglo-Saxons of this period are pagan and they are moving in and starting to take over the whole of England, mainly in the east at this moment,\" he said. \"It's slightly ironic, these people are definitely not Christian, yet they are copying a Christian image - the moot point is if they understood the imagery - and they blundered the lettering, so they're certainly not literate.\" Anglo-Saxons began to settle in England in from AD410, and by AD500 were being fiercely resisted, in a period which used to be known as the Dark Ages, but is now called early medieval by historians. The \"garbled\" lettering around the emperor's image reads D N HONORIVS P F AVG and was \"more-or-less accurate\", the numismatist added. On the other side of the 23mm (0.9in) long by 20.2mm (0.8in) wide pendant can be seen a figure holding a banner with a cross design. Andrew Williams/Norfolk County Council Honorius became sole ruler of the Western Roman Empire aged 10 and had to flee Rome when the Visigoths occupied the city in AD410 Dr Marsden said such imitations were \"very unusual\". \"We see Roman gold coins being repurposed as pendants, occasionally with very similar suspension loops, but here they've made the whole thing from scratch,\" he said. Despite the collapse of the empire, the Anglo-Saxons would have come across many impressive Roman buildings, as well as coins and artefacts, and that may be why they want to copy something \"so distinctly Roman\". He also suggested the pendant could have been part of a burial, rather than having been lost, indicating it came from the owner's grave which was ploughed up over the centuries until it finally rose close enough to the surface for the detectorist to find. It is believed a museum plans to acquire the object. Follow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

Cambridge University PhD student Emily Rhodes delved into petitions submitted by women to the Lancashire quarter sessions courts between 1660 and 1720. In one case, Alice Brewer of Lea struggled for years as the parish cut and withheld payments for \"a poor distressed child\", in another, Elizabeth Drinkwater was \"impoverished\" after the Great Bolton overseers failed to pay up for nine months. Ms Rhodes said the cases showed 17th Century foster mothers had greater powers to challenge authorities than biological mothers. \"These women provided such a vital role that when they weren t paid enough or at all, they had enough authority to approach their county justices, powerful men, and successfully argue their case,\" she said. Emily Rhodes Emily Rhodes \"stumbled across\" their stories during her PhD research into 17th Century mothers In a study published in The History of Family journal, Ms Rhodes looked at the experiences of 38 women caring for non-kin children in their parish and who took their cases to courts sitting in Lancaster, Preston, Manchester, Wigan and Ormskirk. Traditionally, this work was called \"boarding\" or \"tabling\", but it had many similarities with modern fostering, with the parish authorities judging if the family situation was suitable for the children. Ms Rhodes said: \"When they decided it wasn t, they sought to place them in a new home, ideally with somebody from their local community, and they compensated this person to look after the child.\" The women were often widows, sometimes unmarried, and occasionally a husband took the decision on behalf of the family. \"In their petitions they refer to 'the child was put on me' or 'the husband decided this' and the woman has had to continue the arrangement itself; it is not consensual,\" said Ms Rhodes. Wellcome Collection Petitions \"boomed in the 17th Century\", giving men and women, rich and poor, a system to resolve conflicts in the courts, in Parliament or before the monarch Most of the women were entitled to poor relief in their own right under the Poor Laws, a system which saw parishioners contributing to a local pot of money. The funds were allocated by churchwardens and overseers of the poor to the parish needy. It could provide poor women and families with vital income. The standard payment for one child was 40 shillings a year, although they ranged from 12 to 78 shillings - this far exceeded average poor relief payments of the time. Forty shillings was the equivalent of about  227 in today's money - or 28 days of a skilled tradesman's wages. The Met Many of the Lancashire foster mothers were illiterate but could still use the system to bring a legal case - or petition - against those who owed them money for feeding and clothing the children Records show Anne Beesley took in three destitute children in Barton in 1671, fearing \"they would starve to death\" - but was only reimbursed after she petitioned the courts. She still had significant advantages over biological mothers, said Ms Rhodes, who had to \"prove, in a grovelling and pitiful tone, that they were among the deserving poor\". For foster mothers it was enough to say \"you re not fulfilling your part of the deal\". Ms Rhodes also sees parallels with the present. \"You will see stories of foster carers not receiving enough support and leaving the system,\" she said. \"We still face issues with bureaucracy and people in authority not doing their jobs properly.\"",

Henrietta Sandford, from Helston, shared diaries and letters, written by her great-uncle James Simpson while he was stationed on the vessel the Lady Olive, with a team of divers searching for the wreck of the UC-18. Karl Taylor, an underwater filmmaker who made a documentary of the discovery, said there had been doubts about whether the U-boat had been sunk, but Mr Simpson's diaries had helped the team to establish it had and to pinpoint where it rested. It was the only known battle where a navy ship and a submarine had sunk each other, Mr Taylor said. Mrs Sandford said future generations would be able to watch the documentary even if the letters and diaries had disintegrated with age On the morning of 19 February 1917, German submarine UC-18 opened fire on the Q-Ship the Lady Olive. Q-ships were heavily armed decoy vessels used by the Royal Navy, made to appear like harmless merchant or fishing vessels. They were used to entice U-boats to the sea's surface and then attack them. As the U-boat drew near to assess the damage it had inflicted, the Lady Olive counter-attacked. Mike Sandford, Mrs Sandford's husband and a historian, explained neither ship had ever been found so there remained a mystery around the incident. The British crew would get a prize for sinking a submarine, so there was \"a motive to make this up\", he said. James Simpson's diary helped locate a German U-boat sunk by a Royal Navy Q-ship Mr Taylor said some historians had questioned whether, in fact, the German submarine had escaped with light damage - but Mr Simpson's diaries indicated otherwise. He said: \"James's version of events and the way he wrote about it indicated that the crew were telling the truth.\" However, there was still no information about exactly where the battle had taken place. Here, Mr Taylor said, the diaries had helped by allowing the dive team to rule out areas because they did not reference significant markers such as land masses and lighthouses. \"The fact those things hadn't been mentioned in the diaries or the days leading up to them gave me some clues to maybe where they weren't located at the time of the battle,\" he explained. 'Really brave' After a four-year search, divers from Guernsey discovered the UC-18 at a depth of more than 70m (230ft), about 80km (50 miles) off the coast of Jersey in March. Mrs Sandford said the diaries and letters between her great uncle and his family held a personal meaning to her. She said: \"When you've got letters home which say 'practise your piano' and 'your handwriting's got to get better because you're obviously a good boy, James', it makes you realise they're a real family talking. \"One really sweet letter said 'you were really brave not to cry when I last left' and 'save me some Christmas pudding' - it's that element that sticks with me.\" The submarine sank with all 28 of its crew but every member of the crew on the Lady Olive was saved. James Simpson died in action in 1918.",

That year's race, described as \"of the most cheerless character\", was held \"in the teeth of a bitter gale and snow storm\" on 23 March.

Ms White suggested the owner of the souvenir was unable to hold on to it between their chilly fingertips and allowed it to slip into the river. Getty Images An illustration of the race shows heavy rain and poor visibility The Boat Race sees crews from Oxford and Cambridge universities compete against each other on the Thames, with the first men's race taking place in 1829 and the women's in 1927. The race in 1872 was conducted under horrible conditions - according to the Times, \"a pitiless descent of swirling snow was literally blinding to the occupants of the steam-boats that followed the crews\". The Illustrated London News said: \"Crowds failed to materialise on the handy vantage point of Hammersmith Bridge, and the whole event was dismal, partly because of the appalling weather, but also because of a certain failure of spirit all round.\" It was a change from the usual - which saw the riverside throng with spectators, each sporting \"their bit of deep or pale blue\". 'Brutal and noble' As described in London: A pilgrimage, by Gustave Dore and Blanchard Jerrold, published in 1872, Boat Race day was a city-wide event. \"Why are those urchins, perched up in yonder limes, at the peril of their necks, to catch a glimpse of the struggle between the Oxford and Cambridge crews, so utterly possessed with the keen spirit of the day? \"Why is the gypsy lad proud of the pale blue in his straw hat? \"Why are those groups of poor shop-men wrangling over the relative merits of the Cambridge and Oxford stroke?\" The reason, according to Dore and Jerrold, \"is the combativeness which lies deep in the English nature, and which has expressed itself in brutal and in noble forms ever since we were a nation. \"It is not a love of gambling, but the hot desire to be on one side of every conflict, that leads all classes of Englishmen to the race-course. \"It is the race of life expressed in a happy, festive manner.\" Trustees of the British Museum The Waterloo helmet is made from two pieces of copper alloy sheet held together by copper alloy rivets What is mudlarking?

The comments were made by Christian L bcke, military historian and regional director of the German War Graves Commission. Discussing the film, made by Karl Taylor, he said: \"The way he's dealt with the discovery has been exemplary and I hope many other filmmakers, British and German, follow suit.\" The vessel UC-18 was lost in 1917 after a battle with a secret Royal Navy ship, Lady Olive, which was also sunk.

        "content": "In the age of social media, we're living through a communications revolution. But this isn't the first one, nor is it the first time cats have been at the centre of social change. It is a fundamental law of media history: as soon as a new communications technology emerges, people will use it to make pictures of cats. And those cat pictures show not only the special relationship between humans and their pets, but the changing ways that humans relate to one another. Cat memes in their modern form date back to the 1990s, when email first allowed bored office workers and friends to message each other funny felines. The cats jumped from there to social media as the web developed, where viral videos like Keyboard Cat and memes such as Grumpy Cat bloomed across platforms. Demand for this content was so high that entire websites like ICanHasCheezburger sprung up to showcase the best e-cats, aggregating popular pet videos and cat memes. But there was another trend long before any cat wanted to \"has cheezburger\", or any owner could even imagine taking a video of their pet with a handheld electronic rectangle: the Edwardian postcard. And, according to scholars of media history, understanding the cat postcards of the early 20th Century might help us to understand social media today.",

Codenamed Operation Market Garden, the Battle of Arnhem took place in the closing months of World War Two. Among the British forces was 21-year-old L/Sgt John Baskeyfield, known as Jack, who was born in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. The assault however, ended in a failed attempt by the Allied Forces to capture a series of bridges in Nazi-occupied areas. Thousands of Allied soldiers were captured or killed in the battle, which was later depicted in the film A Bridge Too Far. L/Sgt Baskeyfield was posthumously awarded a Victoria Cross for his actions, single-handedly manning two anti-tank guns and refusing to leave his post despite being seriously injured. 'Courage off the scale' A citation from his award read: \"The fact that the surviving men in his vicinity were held together and kept in action was undoubtedly due to his magnificent example and outstanding courage.\" He was killed during the battle by a shell from an enemy tank. A statue now stands at Festival Park in Etruria, ensuring his bravery is permanently remembered. Andrew Felton was one of those who travelled to Arnhem over the weekend to take part in the commemorations. His grandparents were close friends with L/Sgt Baskeyfield, he said, and would often speak about what a lovely person he was.  The more I look into it, the more it s mindblowing what he and thousands of other troops did,  Mr Felton told BBC Radio Stoke.  Lots of times I ve thought, 'Crumbs, even now in my 50s, my life experience is nothing compared to that'.  What most of us are like at 21, just the courage and humanity is off the scale.  Two British soldiers killed in Operation Market Garden were laid to rest earlier this week with full military honours in the Oosterbeek war graves cemetery Mr Felton said it was now well known that there were significant issues with logistics and supplies relating to Operation Market Garden, as well as problems with decision making from senior commanders, including an underestimation of the German firepower.  They were massively against the odds almost from the moment they landed on 17 September,  he said. He said L/Sgt Baskeyfield s first gun had jammed, and he then suffered a serious leg injury, but nevertheless he dragged himself across a street in order to use another gun. He then proceeded to take out two or three tanks, Mr Felton added. He said it was important for him to participate in commemorations, to get an insight into what took place and to keep the respect and honour alive for the fallen soldiers.",

        "content": "The journey that helped save Nigeria's art for the nation 21 September 2024 Share Save Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani Letter from Africa series Share Save Getty Images Items similar to this ivory mask were collected in the 1960s by Americans Charlie Cushman and Herbert Cole for the Nigerian National Museum The Nigerian National Museum in Lagos sits in the city like a respected but unloved relative - it somehow exudes importance but remains largely unvisited. This is perhaps because the concept of a museum is based on a colonial idea   stuffing cabinets full of exoticised objects removed from the context that gave them any meaning. Olugbile Holloway, who was appointed earlier this year to head the commission that runs the National Museum, is keen to change this - he wants to take the artefacts on the road and get them seen back where they once belonged.  How organically African [is this concept of a museum] or has this ideology kind of been superimposed on us?  he asked me.  Maybe the conventional model of a nice building with artefacts and lights and write-ups, maybe that isn t what s going to work in this part of the world?  Established in 1957   three years before independence - the museum houses objects from across the country, including Ife bronze and terracotta heads, Benin brass plaques and ivories, and Ibibio masks and costumes. But there is also an irony   Mr Holloway's job would not exist if the antiquities department, set up by the colonial government, had not got people to go around the country to collect the pieces that ended up in the museum. Some may have otherwise been stolen by Western visitors with less scruples to be sold on the lucrative European and American artefacts market. While others could have been destroyed by zealous Nigerian Christians convinced that they were the devil s work. Herbert M Cole Masks, like this one pictured by Herbert Cole in 1967, remain a significant part of many ceremonies in Nigeria In 1967, an unlikely American duo of Charlie Cushman, a hitchhiker, and Herbert  Skip  Cole, a postgraduate student, were sent around the country by the antiquities department, to gather up some of the heritage.  It was an incredible opportunity to spend - what was it, two weeks? - to venture into small enclaves and villages in south-eastern Nigeria,  Mr Cushman, now 90, told me. At that time, significant cultural artefacts were kept in traditional shrines, palaces and sometimes caves. They were often central to the area's traditional religions. Household heads and shrine priests were responsible for maintaining and protecting these items.  What I found particularly interesting is that many people in the villages seemed very willing to part with masks and objects that had been in their families for a long time,  89-year-old Mr Cole told me.  I was able to buy masks for two or three dollars. They would be worth hundreds in Europe at the time.  Its monetary value wasn t important in Igbo villages. \"They used the objects for ceremonies, for entertainment, for commemorating ancestors and nature spirits... which is probably why they were able to sell things inexpensively when they decided that they were no longer useful to them.  Herbert M Cole The objects that Herbert Cole (L) and Charlie Cushman (R) gathered in south-east Nigeria remain in the National Museum's archive Mr Cushman kept detailed journals of his experiences as they travelled together in a VW minibus and on foot to retrieve these artworks, including ceremonies they observed and people they met   and those handwritten notebooks have survived more than 50 years. I was especially fascinated by their efforts to persuade Christian converts not to destroy artefacts, which they considered pagan and evil. The diaries describe meeting a Mr Akazi, a school headmaster and  self-appointed crusader of God  who had burnt some ancestral figures.  They are evil and remain as crutches to the people. Only with their destruction can we rid the people of these monstrous influences,  Mr Akazi is quoted as saying. Mr Cole tried his best to explain.  We are here to try and preserve these art objects for future generations. Rather than destroy them, could we not have them sent to the Lagos Museum where they will accomplish both of our purposes? For you, they will no longer be here to serve as obstructions to Christianity, and for us, they will be preserved.  It seems that the headmaster was persuaded to hand them over, but did not see their cultural value.  You see for me there are too many emotional ties connected with these hideous manifestations of Satan. Perhaps for you, these things are art, but they can never be so for me,  Mr Akazi said. Reading those excerpts reminded me of the times I have accompanied compatriots, who were visiting me in London, to the British Museum to see some of the Nigerian artwork on display, mostly looted from our country. Some of my guests, who were committed Christians, refused to take photographs of themselves standing with any of the objects, concerned that they might be fraternising with demonic items. We laughed about it, but they were serious. Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani For some, Igbo objects like these in the British Museum are perceived as being manifestations of Satan Mr Cushman and Mr Cole s mission originated from an assignment by Kenneth C Murray, a British colonial art teacher, who was a key figure in Nigeria s museum history. Murray was invited to Nigeria at the request of Aina Onabolu, a European-trained Yoruba fine artist who convinced the colonial government to bring qualified art teachers from the UK to Nigerian secondary schools and teacher training institutions. Murray believed that contemporary art education should be grounded in traditional art, but there were no collections in Nigeria available for study. He was also concerned about the unregulated export of Nigerian items. To address these issues, Murray and his colleagues pressured the colonial government to legislate against the exportation of artefacts and to establish museums. This resulted in the inauguration of the Nigerian Antiquities Service in 1943, with Murray as its first director. He established Nigeria s first museums in Esie in 1945, Jos in 1952 and Ife in 1955. Mr Cole was studying African art at New York s Columbia University and conducting fieldwork in Nigeria when Murray assigned him to collect artwork from south-eastern Nigeria for the newer museum in Lagos. Other scholars and Nigerian employees of the museums were tasked with doing this elsewhere in the country.  I collected more than 400 artworks for the museum,  Mr Cole said.  Murray came to my flat in Enugu and carted things off both to the museum in Lagos, and also to the museum in Oron.  Herbert M Cole Herbert Cole photographed an artist painting the wall of a house dedicated to the Earth goddess in the Mbari style Mr Cushman studied at Yale and Stanford Universities. He turned down the opportunity to work with investment company Merrill Lynch in New York, eventually deciding to travel the world. He ended up in Nigeria where he met Mr Cole, an old school friend, and was persuaded to join him on his mission. The journals that Mr Cushman kept are all that survive from the trip. Unfortunately,  Skip  lost all his own records when he was forced to flee south-east Nigeria during the civil war, which started in July 1967 when the region's leaders seceded from Nigeria and formed the nation of Biafra. He was sad to learn later that some of the artwork he had collected for the museum in the southern town of Oron had been destroyed.  The Nigerian army took over the museum because it was the only building around with air-conditioning so they would use artefacts as firewood to cook their food,  he said. But much of what the two men, and others, collected survived and is now the responsibility of Mr Holloway as the head of the Nigerian Commission for Museums and Monuments. He hopes to develop a new concept of a museum that is more appealing to, and representative of, Nigerians and Africans.  We have about 50-something museums across the country and the vast majority are not viable, because people are not interested in going into a building that has no life.  To the white man or to the West, what they would call an artefact to us is a sacred object  I feel that the richness in those objects would be to display them as they would originally have been used.

        "content": "Bristol's hidden history of forgery and tragic deaths 21 September 2024 Share Save Bea Swallow BBC News, Bristol Share Save Historic England Unknown to some, dotted around the city are surviving relics of the past As you wander through the streets of Bristol, it is easy to see how it has proved the backdrop for literary icons, political figures, and many pivotal moments in history. But how much of these stories still remain and are known to the city's dwellers? Google The school fa ade faces St Mary Redcliffe Church across the road If you have ever driven down Bristol's Redcliffe Way and marvelled at the peculiar fa ade of an 18th century building - it harbours a fascinating story of poverty, forgery, tragic death and medieval poetry. Nicknamed 'Bristol s Shakespeare', literary genius Thomas Chatterton was born in the schoolmaster's house of Pile Street School in 1752, where his late father was a writing master. Among his father's belongings were forgotten medieval documents he had rescued from a chest in the muniment room of St Mary Redcliffe Church, which cast a large gothic shadow over their modest home from across the street. It is thought that these ancient deeds inspired Chatterton to create his own medieval works, which he then attributed to a fictional 15th century monk named Thomas Rowley. Thomas Chatterton Manuscript Project Chatterton was admitted as a pupil to Pile Street School at the age of five After these spurious documents were rejected by publishers, Chatterton left for London in April 1770 to pursue his writing career, but died just four months later from arsenic poisoning. His tragic demise at the age of 17 cemented his legacy as a romantic figure. \"Chatterton had ample funds to buy food and cover his other expenses, so it wasn't want that took him to the grave,\" said Richie Fenlon, from the Thomas Chatterton Manuscript Society. \"He was self-medicating for an STD with laudanum, or a lethal mixture of Calomel and Vitriol, and suffered an unintentional overdose which resulted in his death.\"  Italian restaurant La Panza now occupies his old home on Redcliffe Way, nestled behind the fa ade of where his former school once stood. Rebecca Faith The cobbles which once lined the street can still be seen between the tracks If you're popping for an appointment at Gloucester Road Medical Centre in Horfield, odds are you've walked right alongside a set of old tram lines, which were rendered out of action by a German bomb. Bristol was once highly regarded as a pioneering city in urban transport, with the first horse-drawn tram appearing in the city in 1875. Two decades later, electric trams were introduced. At its peak, there were 17 routes and 237 tramcars in use across the city, with a system stretching its tendrils from Broadmead to Filton. Google The Grade II* listed electricity generating station is still standing beside St Philip's Bridge This was until 11 April 1941, when the Luftwaffe's Good Friday air raid snatched the system away in one foul blow. The Bristol Blitz set the central city on fire, and a bomb dropped on St Philip's Bridge severed Bristol Tramways' entire electricity supply, which came from the generating station beside the river. Today, all that remains of the ground-breaking network are the parallel scars it left behind in the concrete. Charlie Revelle-Smith, author of Weird Bristol, says the city has played a \"significant role in almost every major event in British history.\" \"Once you start peeling back the layers, you soon discover that evidence of this history is all around us. \"Suddenly, this hidden story of our past doesn t seem so hidden anymore.\" Paul Francis The statues, made by Julian Warren in 2016, depict the animals in weird and wonderful positions. In a city renowned for its immersive street art, spotting a sculpture or two on your way to work is not unusual. But among those you may not know of is a collection of bronze monkeys dotted around Clifton that provide a glimpse into a past day of pure chaos. In 1934, 12 Rhesus monkeys escaped from the Monkey Temple enclosure at Bristol Zoo and wreaked havoc all over the city, with one even sneaking into a Clifton College dormitory. Bristol Zoo The Rhesus monkeys moved out of the enclosure in the 1980s, to enjoy a more natural habitat with trees, islands and lakes Most were retrieved fairly quickly, but the final monkey was on the run for almost a week before zookeepers managed to lure him back to captivity with a trail of food. The statues, made by Julian Warren in 2016, depict the animals in weird and wonderful positions.

The stone frontage was reinforced by concrete beams to prevent leaning or collapse The majority of people driving along the Portway are likely to be glancing up at Bristol's pride and joy- the Clifton Suspension Bridge, while also trying to keep eyes on the road. But if you take a second to look closer at the Avon Gorge cliffs, you'll discover the secrets carved into the limestone. The Clifton Rocks Railway began operating in 1893, tunnelling 450ft underground to connect Clifton with the tramway and ferry station at the bottom of the hill. During its first year, the funicular railway carried close to half a million passengers, but its popularity steadily declined until its closure in 1934. Clifton Rocks Railway At the time of construction, the railway tunnel was the widest of its kind in the world During World War Two, the British Overseas Airways Company rented the top portion of the railway as storage space for barrage balloons that would be used throughout the conflict. Air raid shelters were constructed below for employees and the general public, while the BBC set up camp in the lower section of the railway tunnel, in need of a secret broadcasting base that would be safe from bombings. Over the last 19 years, a group of volunteers have been working to restore parts of the tunnel and open it as a museum for visitors.",

In an airborne spectacular, 700 paratroopers from eight Nato nations - including the Netherlands, Germany, UK and US - will parachute from 12 aircraft. The jump will be done in two waves and those involved will land at the same location at Ginkel Heath, near the Dutch town of Ede. Among them will be members of the parachute display team, the British Red Devils. The airdrop is one of several events organised to mark the anniversary of Operation Market Garden, an ambitious military offensive designed to speed up the invasion of Nazi Germany and shorten the war in Europe. Among those who parachuted into the Netherlands were 1,900 allied airborne soldiers from Britain's 4th Parachute Brigade. It combined one of the largest airborne assaults in history, known as \"Market\", with a ground offensive, \"Garden\", aimed at swiftly capturing key bridges over the Rhine River. Immortalised by the everyday phrase \"a bridge too far\", the failure to secure a final bridge at Arnhem was the result of stronger-than-anticipated German resistance, logistical setbacks and tactical decisions by Allied commanders. Soldiers from the Royal Yorkshire Regiment carried Pte Moon's coffin to the war graves cemetery in Oosterbeek Two British soldiers killed in Operation Market Garden were laid to rest earlier this week with full military honours in the Oosterbeek war graves cemetery, close to Ginkel Heath. Their coffins were dressed in Union Flags and carried by military bearer parties. Private Henry Moon, 7th Battalion, The Green Howards, was part of the ground offensive and was killed at the age of 21. His remains were identified through a DNA match. It was a humbling moment, his great-nephew David Snowdon told the BBC, to see hundreds of people turn out to pay their respects. Lieutenant Dermod Green Anderson, a glider pilot who landed with his troops in a village northwest of Arnhem, was killed when an enemy shell exploded near his trench just hours before the evacuation order came. His great-nephew, Lieutenant Colonel Julian Anderson, watched as his wooden coffin was gently lowered into a freshly dug grave - stunned to discover his great-uncle s body had lain undetected for decades nearby. The body of Lt Dermod Green Anderson was also buried this week, having lain undetected nearby for decades Many of the thatched roof villas and apartments around Arnhem display the merlot flag decorated with a leaping pegasus, dedicated to the British Airborne forces, to ensure the sacrifices made for their freedom are not forgotten. Some of the most ferocious fighting took place on these tranquil, tree-lined streets during the eight-day battle. The battles were so incongruously bloody that those who witnessed war on their doorsteps recalled taking refuge from the relentless gunfire and described the paratroopers dropping like \"stars falling from the sky \" The area was eventually swarmed by victorious Nazi soldiers and became one of the last places to be liberated from the Nazis. This eastern Dutch region has long maintained its traditions as a heartland of Allied remembrance. Sary and Mattijs van Gessel said the  Wandeltocht  was a chance to educate their sons Koen and Tom So, why do the Dutch still put such great emphasis on remembering the failed Allied effort? Earlier this month, the BBC sought answers from walkers on  Wandeltocht  - the world's largest one-day commemorative march that follows the footsteps of the Allied forces, passing key historical landmarks. Thirty-four thousand people armed only with water bottles took part in the annual tribute, which encourages young and old to engage with history in a meaningful way. As living memory passes with the remaining veterans, the Dutch feel a responsibility to share these stories and ensure their legacy is maintained. Mattijs van Gessel s sons Koen and Tom are hiding shyly behind his shorts. Their mother Sary told the BBC it was an opportunity to educate them. \"Wars take place everywhere and we tell them our safety is not something that you can take for granted,\" she said. That morning, during breakfast, Sary said the family had discussed why all the military personnel were in the village. \"If this wasn t happening then we wouldn t be talking about it.\" Amanda Juanita Diemel thought learning from the past was especially important given the world today One gentleman, Geert, told me he had goosebumps on the walk. His adopted grandfather was wounded by a piece of shrapnel and was tended to by two Dutch nurses. The shrapnel and his beret are on display in the Oosterbeek museum. \"We would like to take it back for the family but it is more important for the world to see the evidence. It s most important for kids to know it was real,\" Geert said. Another participant, Amanda Juanita Diemel, told the BBC that they were \"walking with history\". \"It makes it very concrete, very tangible,\" she said. \"It s important to keep it alive, to learn from the past, especially with everything going on in the world today.\" As weeks of commemorations to mark the 80th anniversary of Operation Market Garden draw to a close, these moments have caused people to pause and remember the price paid to restore peace in Europe.",

Queen Victoria is thought to have removed her uncle's six-octave piano from the Royal Pavilion in the mid 19th Century, during her reign. The gilt, rosewood piano is later believed to have had private owners until reappearing at auction in 2017 when it was bought by Brighton & Hove City Council and returned to the Royal Pavilion. The historic instrument, which has now been restored and retuned by Brighton & Hove Museums (BHM), will be played by pianist Matthew Fletcher on Thursday evening. The Georgian piano was made by Thomas Tomkinson in 1821 and has been played by Italian composer Gioachino Rossini and Hungarian prodigy Franz Liszt. A brass plate on the rosewood piano reads: \"Thomas Tomkinson, Maker to His Majesty\". It also contains a hidden note on the bottom key from Tomkinson which says \"For the King\". Restorer Jean Maurer has had to reverse tweaks made by past owners to recreate the piano's original sound. The restoration now means each key plays three piano strings again. Tuner Cesar Hernandez said: \"It was in very bad condition before the restoration.\" The grand piano will be played for museum patrons by Glyndebourne Festival Opera's Matthew Fletcher on Thursday evening. 'Rightful home' The piano has been positioned in its original place in the Music Room Gallery of the Royal Pavilion. Museum staff consulted a 1826 aquatint print from John Nash s Views of the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and an earlier drawing by August Charles Pugin. Hedley Swain, CEO of the BHM, said: \"It is hugely significant to our historical understanding of the period and it is an honour to have it restored and playable once more in its rightful home.\" King George IV was Prince Regent from 1811, before ruling the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1820 until his death in 1830.

The Morfa Gunnery Range, complete with accommodation for troops, engine sheds and links to the mainline railway, was spread over a thousand acres of what is now Harlech Forest on the coast of north-west Wales. The centrepiece was a 5km (3 mile) railway line which allowed soldiers to fire anti-tank guns at carriages as they were towed along the track. \"The railway is a really exciting relic, about which we knew very little before,\" said Jane Kenney, who led the dig for Heneb - the Welsh Trust for Archaeology. The full route of the target railway was identified using laser imaging techniques and aerial photographs, with a 1km length surveyed on the ground in detail. What remains is a 2m (6ft 7in) high protective bank supported by a wall made from concrete-filled sandbags. \"Anti-tank training ranges were rare in Britain at the time, and this is a particularly well-preserved example with an unusual and extensive track system for the targets,\" said Ms Kenney. The survey of the site was funded by Natural Resources Wales' (NRW) Sands of Life project which aims to rejuvenate dunes across Wales. Most of the lost railway embankment was covered in scrub, bramble, debris and conifer trees but a 1km stretch was cleared by NRW allowing the remains of the rail line to be inspected and surveyed. \"Despite its size and importance, the training range has never been fully researched and recorded and clearing parts of the site allowed us to find out more about it,\" Ms Kenney explained. \"Although relatively recent history, the importance of Second World War archaeology is becoming increasingly recognised by experts and the public alike.\" Natural Resources Wales An aerial photo of the former military training camp",

The week-long excavation the brainchild of the Friends of Derry s Walls (FDW) is led by a team of experts from Queen s University Belfast's Centre for Community Archaeology (CCA). The CCA team will explore a grass bank at the foot of the walls, thought to be the site of a 17th-century defensive ditch. Pupils from local schools and members of the public will also get involved in the excavation. The Friends of Derry's Walls Previous research suggests the dig site was once the site of a defensive ditch dating back hundreds of years Niall McCaughan, from FDW, said the dig would hopefully  add another layer to the story of one of the island of Ireland s most historic cities\".  It is very exciting, there's been interest locally, nationally, and internationally,  he told BBC News NI. Derry was the first planned city in Ireland and the last walled city to be built in Europe, and its walls, built between 1613 and 1619, are Northern Ireland's largest state monument. Derry's 17th Century fortifications were never breached, withstanding several sieges including one in 1689, which lasted 105 days. The grass bank, which is the area of interest, is at the foot of the walls and overlooks the city s Bogside. Pre-dig preparation over recent weeks has seen the area scanned with ground-penetrating radar. The project has been supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund. What is found in the ditch could prove a fascinating insight into times gone by in Derry, Mr McCaughan said.  You might think it s just a ditch around the walls, but of course that was another defensive mechanism,  he said.  When we first talked about excavating the ditch, Queen s head archaeologist Colm Donnelly said to me,  The great thing about ditches is that is where people threw all their rubbish'.  We are going to get all sorts of 17th, 18th, and 19th century debris that s a really exciting thing.\" The Friends of Derry's Walls The area to be excavated was also once the site of Nailors Row The dig site was also, in more recent times, the site of Nailors Row, a city centre street demolished in the 1970s. That more recent history will also be explored, Mr McCaughan said.  Fifty years have passed now since the time of Nailors Row, in that time this aspect too has become history,  he said.",

        "content": "Amateur archaeologists uncover Bronze Age grave 15 August 2024 Share Save Jacqueline Paine BBC News, Manchester Share Save BBC Local volunteers have been excavating the site for three years An ancient monument uncovered by a team of amateur archaeologists is exciting and puzzling the experts. Three years of excavations on the side of a hill in Aspull, Wigan have revealed a Bronze Age burial site surrounded by a ring shaped ditch that is believed to be a religious henge. The find is thought to be unique to the region and potentially of national importance. Archaeologists digging at the site said more analysis would be conducted on the artefacts that had been discovered at the location. The remains of three cremation urns were found Digging began after an aerial photograph showed the field had a circular crop mark and further investigations revealed there was a low mound in the centre, indicating a possible ancient barrow or burial site. A team from Wigan Archaeological Society discovered the cause of the mark was a deep ditch, at least three metres (9.8ft) wide and one and a half metres (4.9ft) deep, with flat bedrock at the bottom. Bill Aldridge, the society s secretary, said:  In a bronze age burial site you would never get a ditch this big. \"So we were quite convinced that what we had was more like a henge dating to the Neolithic Stone Age from 4,200 years ago.\" Continued excavations have revealed the henge was oval-shaped with a wide gap in the ditch on its west side, thought to have allowed entry to the holy site. Further digging around the central mound area has uncovered the remains of three cremation urns. Thirty-five boxes of fragmented bones were removed from the largest pot, which indicate it could have been a family burial urn. Bill Aldridge says sites of this kind are quite rare in the area It is hoped one of the urns, which has survived relatively intact, can be removed later this year for further analysis. The archaeologists working at the site believe it marks two different points in history. \"From the Neolithic Stone Age period it would have been a ritual holy site,\" Mr Aldridge said. \"But then at a later date, when the Bronze Age people came along, they thought it was something special and decided to create their own funerary monument in the middle of it. \"You do get Bronze Age barrows in the north, but they re quite rare. You usually find them down south in places like Wiltshire. \"And you have to go to the Lake District, Yorkshire, Derbyshire or North Wales before you get henge monuments or Neolithic Stone Age activity. \"You can find henges all over [England] but you don t find them in this area so it s a bit exciting that we ve got this site in Aspull, so close to Wigan.\"",

The film-maker, who would have turned 125 this week, was explaining to the BBC's Huw Wheldon that his deftness at building and maintaining cinematic suspense was rooted in his intuitive understanding of human psychology. Hitchcock had, by this time, already revolutionised the thriller genre with a string of classic films that played on their audience's psyche, such as Vertigo, Psycho and Strangers on a Train. A master at the art of slowly ratcheting up tension on screen, he believed the key to suspense was not merely shocking the viewers but subtly manipulating their perception and emotions. In his movie scenes, he would slowly build a mounting escalation of threat, stretching out the audience's anxiety that something terrible could occur at any moment. Then when the pay-off finally happens, cinemagoers would be flooded with an intense feeling of relief.",

Known as the \"guncotton explosion\", a build-up of vapours from chemically soaked cotton is thought to have caused the blast in Stowmarket, Suffolk, on 11 August 1871. Twenty-eight people were killed, including children, and more than 70 were left injured. The explosion was heard as far away as the coast. Darren Dordoy, chair of the Stowmarket Local History Group, said: \"There wouldn't have been anybody in the whole town that hadn't been affected in some way, shape or form.\" Mr Dordoy said the explosion was \"violent\". \"So loud was this explosion it was heard 32 miles away in Southwold... such a violent explosion also... it lifted the farm barn up in the air and dropped it back down. \"When they investigated it later, it took an acre-and-a-half of barley out of the plant - the stalks were still standing, but the whole of the barley was gone.\" The effects of the explosion remain in the town. He said St Mary's Church in Combs has clear glass in some former stained glass windows because it had never been replaced. Matt Marvel/BBC Darren Dordoy said the effects of the blast still remained in the town The Prentice Brothers' factory made chemical fertiliser and later ventured into a new, explosive guncotton, which was used as a replacement for gunpowder. Mr Dordoy said the cotton was soaked in nitric and sulphuric acids, which should be rinsed to remove the excess and dried before being packed into boxes. However, on the day of the explosion, it was believed the cotton was not dry and on the hot day of 11 August 1871, chemical vapours built up in the boxes. \"When they went to move it, it should be perfectly safe to move... that build-up with chemicals and sudden movement is what they think caused the explosion,\" he said. \"A lot of families lost their main breadwinners.\" The town rallied round and put money towards people who had no income, before putting a memorial in place. \"Humanity steps up to the plate,\" he said. \"The biggest thing about Stowmarket is the people that live in it.

Coin expert Adrian Marsden said turning French coins into brooches was fashionable during this period because \"no native coins were as large\". The discovery was made by a metal detectorist in a rural area south of Cromer and it depicts Enguerrand of Crequi, Bishop of Cambrai from 1273 to 1293. A silver coin minted by a French bishop in the 13th Century and transformed into a gilded brooch has turned up in a field in north Norfolk. The silver coin is about 23 mm (0.9in) in diameter and shows little sign of wear, suggesting it was turned into a brooch within a few years of being minted From the Norman Conquest until the reign of Edward III, England's currency was made up of silver pennies. So when the French king Louis IX, later Saint Louis, minted a large silver coin called a gros tournois, it became fashionable for prosperous people to turn them into brooches. \"Most of the coin brooches we have turning up are made from the gros tournois, as they're invariably the commonest big silver coin,\" said Dr Marsden, from the Norfolk Historic Environment Service. \"And if you're having one of these silver coins made into a brooch, it's a substantial investment as they're worth two or three days' wages.\" This find features a bearded Enguerrand, also known as Ingeramus de Crequy, wearing a bishop's mitre or hat. Dr Marsden said this would not have happened in England. \"You do get bishops in charge of mints, but the coins would have had the king's head,\" he said. \"Generally, high-ranking people in France have more independence than in England - no English bishop would be allowed or dream of putting his head on a coin.\" Little is written about Enguerrand, but whoever turned the coin into a brooch wanted to show his face, instead of the cross on its back to signal their piety.

The statesman was supporting a 1923 fundraising campaign to enable British athletes to take part in the Games based on merit, not just on whether they could afford it. The letter was unearthed in the Churchill Archive Centre, part of the University of Cambridge, which holds the World War Two prime minister's papers. Director Allen Packwood said while most people know Churchill as \"the wartime leader and a bigger man\", he was a keen sportsman in his youth. \"When people think of him now... they don't think of a sporting person, but he was the public school fencing champion in 1892 and when in the Army in India, his polo team won an inter-regimental cup in 1899,\" said Mr Packwood. Curtis Brown, London Churchill wanted the athletes chosen to represent Britain at the 1924 Olympics to be selected for their talent and not only because they could afford it In the speech, the future prime minister called for \"the funds necessary to secure an equal opportunity for our men  We must be in a position to make sure that when our country competes in Olympic Games, real native merit shall not be excluded from our representation because those who prove that merit are poor\". The discovery was made after David Freeman, who edits Finest Hour, the journal of the International Churchill Society, asked Mr Packwood to see if there was anything that might link Churchill to the Olympics. Curtis Brown, London The speech was given less than five years after the end of World War One Churchill delivered the speech at Mansion House, in the City of London, in July 1923, supporting an appeal chaired by his close friend Lord Birkenhead, who was trying to raise  40,000 for the athletes. He added poignantly that the Games would be taking place \"after a war in which our youth and manhood has suffered far more severely than some of the other great nations whom we shall meet in friendly rivalry\". Mr Packwood said: \"The interesting things about this speech is it is not included in the comprehensive publication of Winston Churchill's speeches by Robert Rhodes James, it's not included in the official biography of Winston Churchill and yet it's a fascinating speech setting out his views on the Olympics. \"What struck me about it was many of the concerns mentioned in it are equally relevant to today - the need for funding so that everyone can compete regardless of background, the need for professionalism in sport and the power of sport as a uniting force in difficult international times.\" The 48-year-old politician was in a brief period out of parliament at the time, having lost his Dundee seat in 1922.

        "content": "'I thought days of race hatred were over' - Riots take British Asians back to 1970s 10 August 2024 Share Save Sima Kotecha Senior UK correspondent Share Save Getty Images Mosques attacked with bricks and stones. Marchers chanting  we want our country back.  And a man s head reportedly stamped on during a racist attack. These scenes from the past week in England and Northern Ireland have sparked painful memories among British Asians who remember the 1970s and 80s, when racist violence was widespread and the National Front was on the rise. Harish Patel, in his 70s, says it broke his heart. He says teenagers will have heard from their parents and grandparents about what life could be like in this country.  They ll have thought it was all over. And now they are experiencing it for themselves.  Getty Images Rioters clashed with police in Sunderland on 2 August The disorder was triggered by the fatal stabbing of three young girls in Southport - followed by false speculation that the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker. It sent a thunderbolt of fear down Asian and minority communities. Mungra, an elderly Asian woman who arrived from Kenya 50 years ago, was taken back to her early days in London. She worried the escalating violence would make it too frightening to get milk from the corner shop.  That s how we felt in those days, and I worry.  Tens of thousands of South Asians came to work in the the UK's factories and public services in the 1950s, as the country rebuilt its post-war economy. By the early 1970s, the population had grown to around half a million - because of family reunions and Asians fleeing East Africa, many of whom had been expelled from Uganda. Immigration became a politically charged issue. In 1968, Conservative MP Enoch Powell had given his explosive  rivers of blood  speech, in which he said that by permitting mass immigration, the country was  heaping up its own funeral pyre . The extreme right-wing National Front was at its most vocal and regularly held rallies. Asians had to contend with day-to-day harassment and police brutality.  The climate and fear of racism was so profound that it was hard to ignore that I was of coloured skin,  Mungra says.  It was the usual name-calling when walking on the street, the p-word.  Mungra witnessed the riots in Southall, a predominantly Asian part of west London. They took place in 1979, three years after the racist murder of local Sikh teenager Gurdip Singh Chaggar. Getty Images Thousands attended the funeral of Blair Peach, the teacher killed during the 1979 race riots in Southall Weeks before a general election, the National Front decided to hold a meeting in Southall's town hall. Thousands - mainly Asians, but also anti-racist allies - took to the streets in protest against the far-right and police brutality. Forty were injured, including 21 police, 300 were arrested and a teacher was killed, probably by an officer who struck a fatal blow, according to a Met Police report. These were brutal times which left a lasting trauma on those who lived through them. And they bring me back to my own childhood. I was only a toddler when a lit firework was put through the letterbox of my parents  home in Hampshire. Our neighbours didn t like Asians living on the street. My mum recalls grabbing my brother - a hyperactive child a few years older than me - as he ran towards the front door. She was shaking for hours afterwards. She ll never forget how frightened she felt in that moment. It happened months after the p-word was scrawled on our garage door. We were living with my Gujarati sari-wearing grandmother at the time, and my parents felt incredibly vulnerable. They felt they were being targeted for looking different when all they were doing was trying to live a happy life in 1980s Britain. We moved shortly afterwards. It s striking that decades later, I ve heard Asians - including members of my own family - saying they were again scared to leave their homes. Nervously tugging his fingers, Iqbal, a father from Bolton in his 50s, told me he was terrified and that his children had told him to not go outside.  I thought these days of race hatred were over,  he said. Getty Images Demonstrators from across the community came together to protest against racism in Sheffield on Wednesday Over the seven days of riots, hotels housing asylum seekers were attacked, minority-owned businesses were looted and cars and buildings set alight. More than 400 arrests were made. Muslims were particularly targeted - with missiles hurled at mosques, Islamophobic chants and Muslim gravestones in Burnley vandalised. Police patrols were ramped up, but some younger people said they didn t trust officers to protect them.  We don t feel like they ve got our back when they haven t protected us so far. We feel vulnerable and feel like we ve got to protect ourselves,  said Mohammad, in his 20s. But Wednesday felt like a turning point. As communities braced for a night of disorder, after names and addresses of immigration lawyers were spread online, the unrest largely failed to materialise.

A team working on a dig in Brough have uncovered evidence that fortifications were strengthened in the late 3rd Century, at a time when Britain was ruled by \"rebel\" emperors. An artist's impression has been created to demonstrate the scale of the Roman fort, which was known as Petuaria and protected a major Roman centre. The Petuaria ReVisited Project, which is leading the excavations, will be holding a open event on Sunday, from 10:00 to 16:00 BST. Visitors will be able to tour the site, view finds and take part in family activities.

More than 100 volunteers, many new to archaeology, are taking part in the dig. They are investigating the Roman defences at Burrs playing field, as well as a Roman road in an adjacent garden. Mr Credland said anyone could get involved, and described the volunteers who help excavate the site as \"diverse in every way\". He said people who take part \"learn new skills, meet new people, and develop a new interest\" - as well as enjoying time spent outdoors. \"It's really nice to excavate. Our volunteers might find a piece of pottery or a ring made of brass or bone - but it's interesting to think of the romance behind that. Someone was wearing and lost that ring around 2,000 years ago,\" he said.

        "content": "The association between women and cats is both older and more widespread. In ancient Egypt, where cats were domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago, a half-cat, half-human goddess, Bastet, served as a goddess of domesticity, fertility and childbirth. She protected the home from evil spirits and diseases, and, as with most Egyptian deities, she also played a role in the afterlife as a guide and helper to the dead. In Greco-Roman times, interpretations of Bastet sprung up as Artemis (Greece) and Diana (Rome), with her link to cats still visible albeit to a lesser extent. They took human forms, with Artemis still closely linked to cats, and Diana transforming into a cat (specifically in Ovid's Metamorphoses, when the Roman gods fled to Egypt). In Europe, perhaps the most prominent example exists in Norse mythology: Freyja, the goddess of fertility, love, and luck, rode on a chariot led by two male cats. In ancient China, pest control and fertility were assigned to the cat goddess, Li Shou. So, when did the association between women and cats   most notably in the West   become more negative, and controversial? The origins of the cat-woman connection The answer, it seems, lies in Christianity. \"Effectively women and cats in unison were associated with pre-Christian goddesses,\" Maddicott says, adding [which] \"the church would have frowned upon and [could] be the root of some of the suspicion that later exploded with the witch trials.\" (Witch trials were a series of hearings against people, primarily women, who were accused of practising witchcraft. Guilty convictions resulted in execution). In her book The Cat and the Human Imagination, Katharine M Rogers writes that in the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church viewed free-roaming single women in the same light as female cats on the prowl. Later still, to eradicate Europe of non-Christian beliefs, all non-Christian deities were branded as evil, and cats were declared Satan's minions. A slew of religious propaganda followed, describing either women, cats, or both, as evil. Alamy Agnes Waterhouse and her cat familiar, Sathan forever forged the woman-witch-cat connection (Credit: Alamy) In 1233, Pope Gregory issued the Vox in Rama, a decretal that outlined Europe's \"problem\" with non-Christian religions, accusing them of partaking in satanic cults, while describing these cults' rituals in painstaking detail. According to Donald W Engels' Classical Cats: The Rise and Fall of the Sacred Cat, this papal decree gave \"divine sanction for the extermination of the cat, especially black ones, and the extermination of their female owners\". When Agnes Waterhouse was executed in England's first witch trial in 1566, she confessed that her familiar (a supernatural spirit that served as a witch's companion) was a cat named Sathan (Satan), who was later turned into a toad. The 63-year-old was hanged, forever forging the cat-woman-witch connection, as it made its way to the US, until the end of the Salem witch trials.

The couple would travel up the Nile each year for the next 25 years. They were the quintessential archaeological tourists: members of the upper class, wishing to have a holiday while also learning about the ancient sites they encountered. They purchased ancient artefacts, amassing huge collections themselves. Andrews was influenced both by her own travels and by Edwards' exhortation from her travelogue: \"We are always learning, and there is always more to be learned; we are always seeking, and there is always more to find.\" From 1900 until they left Egypt in 1914, Andrews and Davis would pay for and personally excavate between 25 and 30 tombs in the Valley of the Kings, some of the most consequential archaeological investigations in the country. Alamy Andrews and her partner paid for and excavated between 25 and 30 tombs in the Valley of the Kings, including the tomb of Yuya and Thuya (Credit: Alamy) Laws for excavations in Egypt at the time meant that most artefacts would be deposited into the Cairo Museum, with duplicates going into the private possession of the patron or archaeologist. In 1905, the pair and their crew found tomb number 46, the tomb of Yuya and Thuya, parents of Queen Tiye (the chief wife of Pharaoh Amenhotep III) and the great-grandparents of Tutankhamun. At the time, this tomb was the best-preserved Egyptian tomb ever found, with most of the funerary equipment still inside. Their stunning coffin masks are still on display in Cairo, and their intact chariot   only the second of its kind ever found   sits just behind them. The artefacts are important, but Andrews' diaries are crucial to our understanding of the sites. Her records provide a detailed account of her and Davis' activity over a quarter of a century. She meticulously chronicled their excavations with maps and daily accounts of their visitors and the artefacts they uncovered. Davis used many of Andrews' diaries in his own published site reports, never giving her proper credit. Crucially, Andrews also included in her accounts the people ignored by so many male writers: Egyptian workers, antiquities dealers, boat captains and crew. Her perspective is the foundation for the understanding of centuries of Egyptian history. Andrews' legacy lives on, too, in New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. She and Davis each gave large portions of their collections   more than 1,600 Egyptian artefacts   and their fortunes, to the Met. Each year, millions of visitors view those artefacts, such as the canopic jars from the controversial tomb KV 55. Thanks to Davis' shoddy excavation practices, archaeologists still cannot conclusively agree on whose mummified remains were inside. There is also a restored decorated water bottle from the funerary procession of King Tutankhamun, one of the few Tutankhamun artefacts outside Egypt.

        "content": "Unexpected wonders emerged when climate change-induced drought drained a Catalonia reservoir, including an 18th-Century cannonball factory. I was in Catalonia, walking through a long valley that felt both ancient and post-apocalyptic. Rising from an expanse of dry earth, cracked like shattered pottery, were the remains of several stone buildings, notably two central rectangular structures side by side, perhaps 30m long in total. Roofless and crumbling, piles of rubble were heaped along their walls like rocky dunes. Where there were once windows, vacancies now framed views of the pale blue sky streaked with wispy clouds and viciously bright spring sun. It was an incredible   and unlikely   sight. Built in 1771, in what was once the Sant Sebasti  neighbourhood of the town of Sant Lloren  de la Muga, this collection of buildings, as well as a few since reduced to mere outlines of their foundations, was once the Royal Foundry of Sant Sebasti  of the Muga. It has heavy Brigadoon vibes because, akin to the mythical Scottish city that reappears only once every 100 years, this year was the first time people could visit this decaying foundry in more than half a century. It has been hidden under water since 1969 when the Darnius Boadella dam was completed, flooding the area. The resulting reservoir usually supplies the nearby city of Figueres and surrounding towns, including Cadaqu s, Llan  and Empuriabrava, and helps irrigate local crops and generates hydroelectricity to power the region. However, beginning in 2021, a severe drought caused Catalonia to declare a state of emergency. It also dropped the reservoir's water level to its lowest point ever, making these ruins accessible to anyone willing to make the hike (they were partially unsubmerged during a 2008 drought but were inaccessible on foot). According to Mari  Baig, a local historian who has published several papers on the foundry and is working on a book about its history, the Royal Foundry of Sant Sebasti  of the Muga was Catalonia's first charcoal blast furnace used to make cannonballs. The site was chosen due to its proximity to three necessary elements: wood for creating charcoal to fuel the furnace, water to power the hydraulic bellows that stoked the fire and iron ore from the nearby Montdav  and Rocacorba mines.",

It's hard to beat the views that come with bicycling around Northern California's Angel Island, the largest natural island in San Francisco Bay. As my boyfriend Chris and I pedalled along the island's largely undulating 5.5-mile paved Perimeter Loop, we encountered postcard-worthy vistas around every turn. At one point, we saw the iconic Golden Gate Bridge stretching between San Francisco and the sage-and-yarrow-covered peninsula of the Marin Headlands; at another, we spotted Angel Island's more infamous neighbour, Alcatraz Island, where some of the most notorious inmates of the early-to-mid-20th Century served time. Though I've lived in San Francisco for nearly 30 years, I'd only ever visited Angel Island a few times. Compared to the Bay Area's many other attractions   like Sonoma County's wineries; the waterfront city of Sausalito, which looks like it popped right out of the French Riviera; and San Francisco's many eclectic neighbourhoods   Angel Island tends to get overlooked, even by locals.

It features 350 coins, many of then considered to be rare, dating from 1549 to the 1970s. The unidentified collector from Arundel is said to have accumulated the coins over several decades. The coins will be auctioned at Noonans Mayfair in London on Thursday. The item with the highest estimated value is a rare 1778 pattern shilling from the reign of George III, which could sell for between  1,500 and  2,000. Coin specialist Oliver Hepburn said the coin is attributed to John Sigismund Tanner, who was the chief engraver of the Royal Mint between 1741-1775, and Richard Yeo, his successor from 1775-1779.  Though Tanner died in 1775 - three years before this coin was struck - some argue the engraving work in more in line with Tanner s style than Yeo s - though we cannot know for sure,  Mr Hepburn said.

        "content": "Today, the best way to experience Tainan is simply to wander its narrow streets and soak in its cultural diversity. Tainan is proud of its reputation as the birthplace of Taiwan and the cradle of Taiwanese culture, and it has managed to hold onto its roots more so than other Taiwanese cities. Compared to the capital Taipei or Tainan's nearest neighbour Kaohsiung   with their soaring skyscrapers that seem to reach into the future   Tainan feels like a place where the past and present collide. New high-rises compete for space with ancient monuments and tangled back alleys lined with centuries-old buildings. At weekends, the streets are noisy with the sounds of firecrackers and temple processions: the city has more Buddhist and Taoist temples than anywhere else in Taiwan. Fort Zeelandia still stands in Tainan's Anping district. Tourists wander around the sprawling ruins where modern Taiwan was born, snapping photos of the old brick walls entwined with mammoth banyan roots. Next door, the Kaitai Tianhou temple is dedicated to the sea goddess Mazu. With a history dating back to 1668, the temple is the oldest shrine to the island's most popular deity. Inside, visitors continue the old-fashioned tradition of throwing pue, croissant-shaped blocks of wood, and asking the goddess for advice about their business dealings, family problems and love affairs. Outside, stalls selling shrimp crackers, fried sweet potato balls and Tainan's local delicacy kuann-tsh -pang or \"coffin bread\" (fried bread stuffed with seafood sauce) speak to the city's reputation as Taiwan's street food capital. And on the far side of the road, elderly residents sit on plastic chairs in the shade chatting in Taiwanese, a dialect derived from the original Hokkien spoken by settlers who arrived from Fujian in China that has largely disappeared elsewhere on the island in favour of Mandarin. Before the Dutch arrived, Taiwan's population was largely made up of culturally and linguistically diverse Indigenous groups. When the Dutch established Taiwan's first school in modern-day Tainan in 1636, classes were taught in Siraya, and in 1661, the missionary Daniel Gravius published his translation of The Gospel of Matthew into Siraya as well. One year later, Ming dynasty rebel Koxinga seized Fort Zeelandia and expelled the Dutch, setting in motion waves of migration from China. This first wave of Chinese settlers was mainly made up of Hokkien-speakers from Fujian. But two decades after Koxinga, when Taiwan passed into the hands of the Qing dynasty and Tainan became the capital of the new Taiwan Prefecture, other groups arrived, including a substantial Hakka-speaking community. The island remained under Qing control for two centuries until it was ceded to the Japanese in 1895. The Japanese stayed until the end of World War Two, and Japanese became the island's lingua franca. Today in Taiwan, there are some elderly people who are still more comfortable speaking Japanese than Mandarin. More like this:   Taiwan's little-known original inhabitants   Can Taiwan become Asia's next great hiking destination?   The 96-year-old painter who saved a village Throughout this long, complex history, Indigenous languages were increasingly pushed to the margins. Some, including Siraya, nearly disappeared entirely. But there were further threats to Taiwan's cultural and linguistic diversity on the horizon. In 1949, after their defeat in the Chinese civil war, Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists retreated to Taiwan. To consolidate their rule, the Nationalists imposed martial law and proclaimed Mandarin as the national language, even though hardly anyone in Taiwan spoke it. Nevertheless, for nearly four decades, the Nationalists did their best to transform the culturally and linguistically diverse people of Taiwan into a Chinese-identifying, Mandarin-speaking monoculture.",

I was standing on the lively Plage des Ponchettes beach at the eastern end of Nice's Promenade des Anglais, the large pebbles massaging my feet as I inhaled the salty whiff in the air and watched the early-morning swimmers hobble over the stones to the sea. The hum of traffic on the coastal road was broken momentarily by the squawk of a gull as it launched itself from the shore into the blue sky, narrowly missing a small group of runners. It was busy that day, but Nice's city beach has been full of activity for hundreds of years. The city was an important hub for the salt trade in the Middle Ages and the salt was brought ashore on Plage des Ponchettes in small wooden row boats before being taxed in nearby Cours Saleya, Nice s centuries-old marketplace, and taken by mule on a gruelling journey to Italy where it was traded for use in the mountains and further north. Today, Plage des Ponchettes is the starting point for the Pagarine Route, a new 159km hiking path between Nice and the Italian city of Cuneo that traces the steps of these medieval salt traders. As sustainable tourism officer for Nice C te d'Azur, Sophie Spillaiert has been working on this EU-funded, cross-border sustainable tourism project since 2019. \"There was a lot of salt production near here and it was all brought to Nice to be unloaded on the beach and then packaged, weighed and taxed in Cours Saleya,\" she explained. \"The building on the corner, which is now the Centre du Patrimoine, was where the traders had to pay the salt tax   or the gabelle as it was called   before they were allowed to leave town on the way to the border regions.\"",

In History looks at the real story behind the Chariots of Fire movie myth. The son of Christian missionaries, Eric Liddell was born in China in 1902 and died there 43 years later in a Japanese internment camp. In between, he played for Scotland at rugby, won Olympic gold for Britain and inspired an Oscar-winning film about his athletic exploits many years later. After his spectacular early success, he spent the rest of his life working as a missionary even when it meant putting himself in danger. He died without ever meeting his youngest daughter. It was an extraordinary life, marked by faith, tragedy and courage. At the age of five, Liddell returned from China with his parents to Scotland and he was sent away to the School for the Sons of Missionaries in London, later known as Eltham College. In 1920 he returned to Scotland to study at the University of Edinburgh. His outstanding potential as an athlete was spotted straight away, with the Glasgow Herald tipping him as a future British champion. According to Liddell's university friend Prof Neil Campbell, his running style was unorthodox but not ungainly. Speaking to the BBC in 1984, he said: \"He certainly ran very often with his head back. Now, people say, 'Well, how did he see where to go?' But you put your head back, you can still see perfectly well what's ahead of you.

Seven RAF crew - aged from 19 to 24 - were killed when their Halifax caught fire after being hit by anti-aircraft fire on 6 July 1944. But witnesses at the time believed the actions of the crew in not bailing out possibly saved the lives of those on the ground in Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire. The stricken crew were trying to reach their home base 50 miles (80km) away in North Yorkshire. 578 Squadron Association Pilot Reg Parfitt, Flying Officer Allan Miles, who missed the fatal flight, navigator Brian Turnidge and Sgt Fred Pitts Who were the crew? The crew of Halifax LK-U MZ519 were part of the 578 Squadron based at RAF Burn near Selby, North Yorkshire. Pilot Officer Reg Parfitt, 22, was the son of a fish and chip shop owner from Grangetown in Cardiff. Described as a \"serious and determined young man\", he had been promoted the day before his 23rd successful mission. In the early hours of 6 July he and his crew dropped 10 bombs near St Martin L Hortier in northern France. They returned to base with 21 other bombers just after 05:30. But after a short rest, by 19:00 that night, the squadron was called on again for another mission to hit a V1 rocket base. The V1s were flying bombs launched from sites in France. They were nicknamed \"doodlebugs\" and by the summer of 1944 were starting to cause terror in cities such as London. Joining Reg was navigator Brian Turnidge, 24, an engineer at Fry's chocolate factory in Bristol, the oldest of a young crew and a married man. Fred Pitts, 21, came from a large family in Hale, Cheshire, and one of his sisters was an electrician working on Halifax bombers. Rear gunner Leonard Leatham, 20, from Tipton, Staffordshire, had already served as a fireman in the Blitz in Coventry before joining up. Fellow gunner Arthur Hill, 21, was another Staffordshire man. New to the crew was Raymond Rolph, 23, a stand-in flight engineer from Southend, Essex, and believed to be on his first flight with the squadron. The youngest was bomb aimer John Godin, only 19, who joined the Royal Canadian Airforce, straight from school. What happened to the mission? Their Halifax left at 19:11 BST. There were clear skies and good visibility, and the squadron of 22 aircraft arrived at their targets near Croixdalle at around 21:15. The bombers attacked from heights of between 12,000 and 15,800ft. Heavy flak was reported over Dieppe, according to the reports of the raid. At some point the bomber was hit and it was stricken by the time it arrived back in England. Witnesses first spotted the aircraft south of Nottingham, with smoke and flames streaming from its port outer engine, escorted by another Halifax bomber. Flt Sgt Len Roberts, a member of 578 Squadron, was by coincidence on leave in the area and recognised the squadron lettering on one of the bombers, which dived  like a bat out of hell .  At about 150-200ft, the pilot put the plane into a climb,  he later recalled.  By this time I could see the wing on fire at the roots and assumed that he had dived to try to extinguish the flames by wind force   but the opposite had happened.  By the time the Halifax was over the White Post pub, west of Farnsfield, the fire had rapidly spread and most of the aircraft had been engulfed in flames. Part of the wing and part of an engine broke away and fell into a field by the pub. The blazing aircraft then turned sharply and dived into the ground at 22:25. The RAF operations record for the night reported the Halifax  seen falling in flames, 30 miles north of Nottingham .  This was reported by almost all crews,  it reads.  When first seen it was at approximately 7,000ft with the engine on fire.  It was seen to dive steeply and explode on reaching the ground.  Local Home Guard in the next village of Rainworth had not long finished a parade and rushed to the scene after the loud explosion and a cloud of smoke. One local resident, 32-year-old Hilda Rickett, later recalled the plane going past her window with the wing on fire.  I was a trained first aider so I ran out across the fields but by the time I got to the gate... it was too late, they had all died,\" she said. Parfitt family Reg Parfitt on a visit home to Cardiff The aftermath and memorial A local farmer helped recover the bodies and they lay at the farm overnight. He later planted trees in their memory, while his son was involved in creating a permanent memorial. The crew had been wearing parachutes but had not bailed out and it is thought they were unable to jump clear as the aircraft lost height as it cleared the village. The views of witnesses at the time led to the belief locally that the crew were aware they were crashing but wished to spare Farnsfield from potential loss of life. Nigel Hamilton, chairman of Farnsfield's Royal British Legion, said: \"We're in a valley with hills around - there's very little flat ground around.\" Fate had already intervened to spare two of the squadron's men, who might have been on board that night. Flt Sgt John Davies had been on the plane's early morning mission, as a standby to cover for the regular flight engineer, who was sick. He was nearing the end of his tour of duty and was told by his officer that he d  had enough for one day  and was  virtually ordered  to stand down, to be replaced by the unfortunate Raymond Rolph. Allan Miles had been part of the usual crew but missed out on the mission because he was away on a course.  We never thought about death, we were all young and thought we were immortal,  he later recalled. Brendan Doherty The memorial was opened near the crash site in July 1994 Fifty years later, a permanent memorial was erected, near the crash site and the land was donated by the son of the farmer. Among families and ex-service people at the dedication ceremony in 1994 was Sgt John Wadia, a flight engineer on another Halifax, which survived damage, on the same mission. Over Nottinghamshire, he saw the bomber on fire and  start to break up and then to fall . Mr Wadia later recalled:  Talking to some of them who witnessed the accident, it became apparent that they were still convinced that the crew would not leave the aircraft until it had safely cleared the village, by which time it was too late for their own lives to be saved.\" Farnsfield also named a road after Reg Parfitt and the names of the crew are read out on every Remembrance Sunday. The seven were among 219 crew who lost their lives from 578 Squadron and are still remembered.

        "target_summary": "On 6 July 1944, a Halifax bomber from the RAF's 578 Squadron, struck by anti-aircraft fire over France, crashed near Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire, killing all seven crew members aged 19 to 24. Witnesses at the time believed the crew deliberately stayed with the aircraft rather than bailing out, ensuring it cleared the village and potentially saving lives on the ground. This act of self-sacrifice is remembered through a permanent memorial erected in 1994 near the crash site and annual tributes.",

A large-scale survey across 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) at Attingham Park near Shrewsbury was carried out for the conservation charity to map the area s archaeological remains. The findings will help towards work with tenant farmers on the estate to create new habitats for wildlife while also protecting the archaeological remains, a spokesperson said. Evidence of several Roman roads, historic small farms and a World War Two airfield were also found in the survey. Equipment was used which could cover large areas in a relatively short time and record subtle changes in the local magnetic field. Those results highlighted buried features with different magnetic properties from the surrounding soil. Attingham Park also covers part of the buried Roman city of Wroxeter which is cared for by English Heritage. Experts said the survey turned up evidence of what they believed to be two large rural Roman villas and a Roman cemetery on a road leading out of Wroxeter. There was evidence of at least two construction or occupation phases, they said, with floor plans highlighting internal room layouts and outbuildings. Only six such other similar villas are known in Shropshire. PA Outlines from the survey revealed evidence of two Roman villas, according to archaeologists It was likely the villas would have had features typical of such country estates, such as underfloor heating - known as hypocausts - their own bath houses as well as mosaic floors, the trust said. The survey also detected eight ditched enclosures and remains, possibly Iron Age or Romano-British farmsteads, four of which were previously unknown. These were likely to have been small farms, possibly supplying food for the nearby city, a spokesperson said. 'Tantalising hints' The survey also found evidence of several Roman roads to the west of Wroxeter which added to archaeologists' understanding about activity in the area at the time. Evidence was also found to add to existing knowledge of the World War Two airfield RAF Atcham and its runways, perimeter defences and landscaping. \"We've seen tantalising hints of these remains over the years with evidence showing up in cropmarks, aerial imagery and through small surveys and excavations,\" said trust archaeologist Janine Young. \"But until now what lies beneath the surface of the ground has never fully been investigated.\" She said the Attingham estate had always been known to have high historical and archaeological significance but the survey had provided a \"fascinating picture\" of the estate s hidden past. English Heritage described the survey results as exciting and, along with a further excavation in July, would help build on its knowledge about Wroxeter.",

They are investigating remains at Birdoswald, in Brampton, on the Hadrian s Wall World Heritage Site in Cumbria. This will be the last season of excavations at the site, looking into remains of houses, communal spaces, workplaces, a bath complex and a potential extension of the cemetery area. \"You could go on forever - you could have lifetimes here and you'd still be discovering things,\" said Newcastle University professor and project co-director Ian Haynes. \"But as far as the big questions that we were hoping to address, I think working as a team between the institutions, we have done pretty well.\" Finds from the five seasons of digging at the site will be logged and stored at Tullie museum in Carlisle, where they may go on public display in the future. Ian Haynes has been coordinating the project to discover more about the site Over the course of the five-year project, which began in 2021, Newcastle University archaeology students have also joined the dig. Student Jessica Pugh said finding artefacts was a \"really special thing\". \"Each bit of pot is like a memento from someone else's life - someone's spent loads of time making that and they're not remembered in history, but you're the next person to actually hold that piece of pot again,\" she said. The dig has been an opportunity for students to get hand-on experience on a dig. Student Charlie Rousseau-Williams said: \"It's been really amazing - I've been looking forward to this for most of my life, it's been my dream since I was eight.\" 'Varied settlement' Guided tours are given to spread the word about the importance of the site. \"It's always the way that new questions emerge as you excavate, but we've got a very good sense now, working with our colleagues at Historic England, of just what a varied settlement this was,\" Prof Haynes said. The greatest concentration of finds, ranging from household items to slingshot bullets, was unearthed to the north of the wall last year. Archaeologists said they suggested a deliberately planned community which was thriving and trading, challenging assumptions that civilians were sheltering to the south of the fortifications.

Why isn't his work better known? The existence of black holes is a bewildering thought, especially in light of the idea that billions of them could populate the cosmos. For decades in the 20th Century, eminent physicists refused to believe they could be real, ignoring what the mathematics predicted. These doubters even included Albert Einstein   whose own theory of general relativity made black holes possible (see \"Why Einstein and his peers were 'irrationally resistant' to black holes\".) However, there was one person who showed remarkable prescience about black holes   and did so long before Einstein was even born. Using only Newtonian laws, a little-known British clergyman called John Michell anticipated these astronomically strange objects in some important and surprising ways, all the way back in the 18th Century. Who was Michell, what did he predict, and why were his ideas mostly forgotten? Illustration by Ben Platts-Mills Rector John Michell, who followed \"Newtonian Christianity\", was surprisingly prescient about black holes (Illustration: Ben Platts-Mills, after William Blake) Michell was born in 1724 in the village of Eakring, England, the son of Gilbert Michell, the parish rector, and his wife Obedience Gerrard. Educated at home alongside his younger brother and sister, John had an early reputation for quick learning and perceptiveness. According to the historian Russell McCormmach, his father Gilbert enjoyed quoting a family friend who described John as \"the clearest head he had ever met with\". Gilbert valued independence of thought, describing himself as \"not attached to any body or denomination of men in the world\". The family followed latitudinarian Christianity   a tradition that venerated reason over excessive doctrine and that had originated at the University of Cambridge under Isaac Newton. So, when the time came for John to enter university, it was Cambridge he went to.",

A group of 40 coins dating from 2nd Century BC, and a separate hoard consisting of a Bronze Age axe head, bangle and sword, have been bought by Dorset Museum. The attraction in Dorchester raised  32,000 to acquire both groups to prevent them being taken overseas and broken up. They are to go on display in a special exhibition of treasure. The gold stater coins, found at Charlton Marshall near Blandford Forum, are unusual because they were imported from France - made by a Gaulish tribe called the Baiocasses. The museum said they provided evidence about how people were travelling and exchanging ideas with others on the continent in the centuries before the Roman invasion. PAS/The British Museum The 40 gold stater coins originate from France in the 2nd Century BC The Middle Bronze Age hoard, found in Stalbridge, consists of a palstave axe head, a decorated bangle and a rapier sword that appeared to be deliberately broken in three pieces and buried. Only two similar and incomplete examples have been identified in Britain. John Belgrove, the metal detectorist who found the Stalbridge group, said: \"It's incredible to think these beautiful objects of such skilled workmanship had lain buried in the Dorset mud for over 3,000 years. \"I am still pinching myself that I'm a part of the Stalbridge Hoard story.\" The acquisition was funded by donations and the Arts Council England/V&A Purchase Grant Fund.

        "content": "Eighty years ago on 6 June, D-Day, the largest land, air and naval operation in history was unleashed to fight the Nazis   led by a group of British troops who crash-landed in Normandy in six flimsy gliders. In 1984, the man who led this mission gave an extraordinary account to the BBC. D-Day was a marvel of planning; it involved the simultaneous landing of tens of thousands of Allied troops on five separate beaches in Nazi-occupied northern France. The British and Canadians would land on three beaches in Normandy, codenamed Sword, Juno and Gold. The Americans were to capture Omaha and Utah beaches. Major John Howard and his company's part in this elaborate plan required perfect navigation, great daring and complete surprise. Their mission was to capture two bridges intact   B nouville Bridge, later known as Pegasus Bridge, over the Caen canal, and Ranville Bridge, later renamed Horsa Bridge, over the adjacent River Orne. Because these road bridges were the only way across the parallel water obstacles, capturing them would mean they could stop German reinforcements from reaching the beaches where the Allied armies would land later that day. Then there was another thundering crash, and this time I saw sparks, or what looked like bullets, going past the door of the window, and I thought, 'my God, they're ready for us'   Major John Howard Preparation for this audacious glider mission was intense. Thousands of aerial photographs were taken of the bridges and their defences mapped in detail. The British even created a model of the area which was modified to match each day's aerial photograph. When the Germans cut down trees, the model-makers did the same. The idea of using gliders was that troops and heavier weapons could be landed in the same place behind enemy lines, without the need for parachutes. Because of the need to conserve metal supplies during wartime, the gliders were made mostly of spruce and plywood. They were tricky to operate, and liable to break apart upon landing.",

        "content": "During 1940, after meeting Loudon, Turner realised the film industry was experienced in making sets that were entirely artificial but looked real on camera. Maybe they could build his dummy aircraft? Spotting a business opportunity to create work for the technicians who looked to Shepperton for their livelihood, Loudon bid for and won the contract to build 50 dummy Wellington and 100 Blenheim aircraft. The cost was one third of that charged by aircraft manufacturers. The RAF were delighted, Turner got his dummies and Loudon found valuable war work for his film technicians. Meanwhile, 2,000 miles away, a new unit was created by the British Army in Cairo. Known simply as A-Force, it was led by another pioneer of deception, Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke. Clarke was a lively individual, a good raconteur and had the rather sinister ability of being able to enter a room without anyone noticing his arrival. He started to deceive the Italians and Germans as to Allied intentions in the see-saw Desert War fought across Egypt and Libya. Some of his deceptions did not work but he learned from both successes and failures. He realised that for deception to be effective, it was necessary not just to make the enemy think something, but to do something   to leave their forces in the wrong place or to move troops away from the focus of a new attack. And he rapidly became skilful in the art of creating forces that did not exist, in exaggerating the Order of Battle. He invented a brigade of paratroopers and convinced the Italians that they would be used to drop behind their lines. But no airborne troops existed in North Africa. He went on to invent divisions and army corps to make it look as though the Eighth Army was much bigger than it was. Alamy The idea of creating fake formations as a deception was pioneered in Cairo by Clarke's A-Force (pictured: Special Air Service volunteers training in Egypt) (Credit: Alamy) At the battle of El Alamein in October 1942, Clarke and his fellow-deceivers convinced the enemy that the thrust of the Allied attack was coming from the south of the battlefront. Trucks covered with tarpaulins that made them look like tanks from the air were drawn up, creating what appeared to be tank tracks in the sand. They laid what looked like a pipeline to an imaginary fuel depot in the south, in fact made from old oil drums. The Germans put two armoured divisions in the south to meet this apparent threat. When the battle came, Montgomery attacked from the north of the battlefront. The battle still took 10 days of heavy fighting but outmanoeuvring the enemy undoubtedly helped bring victory.",

Since 2003, Adrian Webb has researched the covert department, predominantly based in Taunton and Bath.

Ian Coleby This is thought to be one of the final views of a purpose-built chart factory before it was demolished They were then securely delivered to a purpose built factory in Taunton where they were printed in \"unimaginable numbers\". \"In the year of 1938 they issued around one million charts and books and in 1944 it staggeringly produced around seven million charts,\" he said. \"It was unprecedented really.\" Adrian Webb An extract from the Channel Handbook published by the Hydrographic Department for use during D-Day, showing Ouistreham in 1943 Adrian Webb A stamp bearing the word \"bigot\" was often printed on many of the operational documents \"It's a true testament to the workers who did incredibly long , tireless hours to get them ready.\" Mr Webb said the most amazing stories came from the workers themselves and their families. \"I believe there are still five people alive who worked in the department and most of them are now 100 years old,\" he said. Alan Bullard Jeanne Bullard was one of the Map Girls who worked in Bath drawing charts during World War Two \"A lady called Ivy, who has now passed away, told me she was tasked with taking a roll of top secret charts from Bath to Taunton by train. \"They locked her into a carriage for security and waited to meet a policeman in Taunton who would deliver her to the factory. \"But unfortunately when she arrived, no-one was there.

Now the Founding Father is the subject of a new series, Franklin, on Apple TV+ starring Michael Douglas.

Winston Churchill   prime minister during the war - ordered the National Gallery's collection to be moved away from London and hidden in \"caves and cellars\". Brick studios and air conditioning were installed inside the mines to store the National Gallery s collection which included work by artists such as Titian, Michelangelo and Constable. Long after the paintings had been returned to London, Glyn Williams and his family from Blaenau Ffestiniog became the owners of the quarry. In the 1980s, Mr Williams said he had plans to expand the work there but the UK government wanted to keep the warehouses in place and restricted blasting at the quarry in case the warehouses were damaged. Getty Images During World War Two paintings were moved from the National Gallery to Manod slate mine for safekeeping Mr Williams won a court victory to effectively evict the government and expanded quarrying at Manod. In 1983 he helped produce a booklet to remember the time the priceless works of art were stored in the quarry. He said transporting some of the paintings proved difficult   a portrait of Charles I on horseback by Van Dyck - was 3.67m (12ft) tall and 2.92m (9ft 7in) wide. Also, a trench had to be dug under a railway bridge in Llan Ffestiniog as the gap was not big enough for the lorry transporting the artwork. Mr Williams said: \"But they still miscalculated by about two inches, so they had to let all the air out of the tyres to get under the bridge and then pump them up again to go up to the quarry.\" He said the paintings were well looked after   experts stayed near the quarry to care for them and a garrison of soldiers guarded them - while air conditioning units kept the air \"quite clean and static\" to protect them. Glyn Williams and his family used to own Manod slate mine near Blaenau Ffestiniog After the war ended, the 2,000 works were returned to their galleries, many to the National Gallery some to Buckingham Palace. As part of the National Gallery s 200th anniversary celebrations, 12 masterpieces from its collection are on display across the UK.

        "content": "Britain's Pompeii: Bronze Age artefacts go on display 27 April 2024 Share Save Katy Prickett BBC News, Peterborough Share Save V Herring/Cambridge Archaeological Unit The well-organised settlement of about 10 roundhouses was less than a year old when a fire broke out and rapidly destroyed it, historians say An extraordinary collection of 3,000-year-old household artefacts discovered at a site dubbed \"Britain's Pompeii\" has gone on display close to where they were discovered. The finds were unearthed at a Bronze Age village at Must Farm at Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, which burnt down. The site has given archaeologists an unprecedented insight into the lives of ordinary people from that era and the artefacts are being transferred to the permanent care of Peterborough Museum & Art Gallery. How does one of the museum's curators hope the city's residents will respond to the lives of their ancient neighbours? 'An emotional response' Cambridge Archaeological Unit The village was built over a river and as the blaze took hold, its contents fell into the silt to be preserved for thousands of years Domestic items from the village were deposited into the river silt after the blaze, where they remained until they were excavated eight years ago. \"They were ordinary people and an extraordinary event happened to them, this catastrophic fire,\" said museum heritage manager Sarah Wilson. \"It's not a battle site, it's a home and in a very short amount of time the residents lost everything, and the story leaves me with an emotional response of how awful. \"It burnt down in about 20 minutes and people were dropping everything and running.\" 'Not a bunch of strangers' Peterborough Museum & Art Gallery It is \"absolutely remarkable\" that fibre and textile items, usually the first to rot away, were recovered from Must Farm, said Sarah Wilson They left behind the largest collection of everyday Bronze Age artefacts ever discovered in the UK, including 200 wooden objects, more than 150 fibre and textile items, 128 pottery vessels and about 90 pieces of metalwork. Ms Wilson said: \"Like us, they had distinct parts of their houses for different tasks. \"The assumption is that Bronze Age people were living hand-to-mouth, just surviving, but the evidence is that it is so much more than that and very well organised. \"The idea of family, home, trading, relationships that most people are familiar with are not random concepts - it stops them being a bunch of strangers.\" Global links Peterborough Museum & Art Gallery The dig revealed the largest find of glass beads from Late Bronze Age Britain, with most of the glass originating from Iran \"Must Farm also dispels the myth that in the past people were quite insular, [that] they didn't move around as much as we do today,\" said Ms Wilson. The personal items include some of the finest textiles produced in Europe at the time - including 48 beads made from glass originating in Iran. She said: \"Peterborough is a global city, with residents with heritage from all over the world. \"So while beads from 4,000km away (2,500 miles) might be unexpected, it creates connectivity for the residents of the city and area and those people from thousands of years ago.\" Pride in Peterborough Sarah Wilson \"As time goes by, we will be putting more of the finds on permanent display,\" said Ms Wilson The excavation's discoveries are of national importance, yet its finds are staying local, about eight miles (12km) from where it was found. Ms Wilson hopes that gives people a sense of pride. \"It validates that Peterborough is not a new city and never was,\" she said. \"It bears the marks of a 1970s and 80s development, but actually we can say it has had occupation for thousands of years.\" Introducing Must Farm, a Bronze Age Settlement runs until 28 September.

It would showcase the unique geology of the Nidd Gorge, as well as the archaeology of the town and surrounding area. Visitors would be able to see footage filmed by an underwater robot, supplied by mechanical engineering experts at the University of Leeds. The footage showed stones lying at the bottom of the River Nidd in Knaresborough which were believed to be from an earlier attempt to build the town's landmark viaduct, which collapsed just before its completion in 1848.

But the only two ever to have been found in the proverbial haystack will be on display in Cork for the next six months. Fossil collector Roger Byrne found fossilised bones of two separate dinosaur species on the same beach in Islandmagee, County Antrim, more than four decades ago. From Sunday, they will be on display as part of an exhibition at Glucksman Gallery in University College Cork (UCC), where for the first time the public can also see nearly 300 fossils from elsewhere. The fossils are from 200 million years ago The fossils are from 200 million years ago, meaning these dinosaurs roamed Earth during the Jurassic period. Dr Mike Simms, from National Museums Northern Ireland, told BBC News NI that Ireland is an unlikely candidate for dinosaur-related discoveries because \"we have the wrong sort of rocks\". \"Most of the rocks that would contain dinosaurs that would be of the right age, we don't have,\" he said. \"They were eroded away long ago, so we're very, very lucky to have these. \"Most of the rocks we have that are the right age for dinosaurs were deposited out at sea.\" University College Cork The exhibit will feature skeleton casts of the only dinosaurs known to have lived on the island of Ireland The fossils are normally on display at the Ulster Museum but they are being loaned to UCC. \"There will be big, spectacular, skeleton casts in this exhibition in Cork but alongside them will be these little bits of bone,\" said Dr Simms. \"I think it's a great opportunity because Cork is quite a long way away, so it's great that they get down to Cork for six months and people can appreciate them there.\" Julian Friers/National Museums NI One of the bones comes from the tibia (lower leg bone) of a two-legged meat-eater similar to Sarcosaurus Who was Roger Byrne? Mr Byrne taught at a school in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, and was \"a very keen, enthusiastic fossil collector\" who was \"meticulous\". He found the bones in 1980 and 1981, on a beach near the Gobbins in County Antrim. Dr Simms, who met him a few times, said he was a talented artist who drew the dinosaur bones he found. \"He was a really exceptional fossil collector - a very good eye - because these bones are basically rather rounded black pebbles and he found them on a beach that was covered with black pebbles.\" A scientific study involving Dr Simms and the universities of Portsmouth and Queen's in Belfast confirmed the origins of the bones for the first time in 2020. One is part of the lower leg bone of a carnivore similar to Sarcosaurus; the other is from the upper leg bone of a Scelidosaurus, a four-legged herbivore. \"It's an extraordinary find really, to find two different dinosaurs in a country which really we shouldn't have,\" Dr Simms said. So could there be more fossils on Islandmagee beaches? \"Quite a few other people and Roger scoured it pretty carefully,\" Dr Simms said. \"I don't think there was really that much left after Roger had been back. He went back many times and his collection was donated to us after he died.\" Julian Friers/National Museums NI Experts suggest Scelidosaurus may have been a coastal animal, perhaps even eating seaweed like modern-day marine iguanas",

They had been sold to an overseas buyer but an export ban was imposed. The museum said the ink and watercolour maps charted a \"defining moment\" in British naval history. Print Collector/Getty Images The English fleet defeated the Spanish Armada in the English Channel in 1588 It is believed the maps, completed by an unknown draughtsman, possibly from the Netherlands, were based on a set of engravings by Elizabethan cartographer Robert Adams. They are thought to be the earliest surviving representations of the campaign which followed decades of hostility between Spain's Catholic King Philip II and the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I. They show the defence of England's shores against invasion by the Spanish fleet of 141 ships and 24,000 men. The English fleet of 66 ships defeated the Armada by sailing fire ships into its formation off Calais. Each map details the position in the Channel of individual ships on both sides. 'Pivotal battle' Prof Dominic Tweddle, director general of the NMRN, said the display was \"hugely significant\". \"The defeat of the Armada was a turning point in forging our nation's identity and the maps act as a powerful commemoration of this pivotal naval battle,\" he added.The maps can only be displayed for 45 days due to their fragile nature and the dangers of exposure to light. They were initially sold for  600,000, but the government imposed an export ban and called for a museum or institution to raise funds to purchase them.

Some theories suggest it was used as a burial site, a place of healing or even a celestial calendar, given that the gaps in the outer stone ring are in perfect alignment with the summer and winter solstice. Yet as the decades pass, this massive monument built on a grassy hill in the Wiltshire countryside remains a mystery. \"We're gradually finding out more and more about it, but some things we just don't think we'll ever be able to find out. We have no way of understanding why people started to build it, and the reason that they continued to work on it may well have changed over the hundreds of years it took to complete,\" said Susan Martindale, volunteer manager for English Heritage, the charitable trust that manages Stonehenge. Thanks to Cox's recent studies, however, we now know a fascinating detail about one of the world's most enigmatic sites: it once acted as a giant echo chamber, amplifying sounds made inside the circle to those standing within, but shielding noise from those standing outside the circle. This finding has led some to ponder whether the monument was actually constructed as a ritual site for a small and elite group. This breakthrough is a decade in the making. While researching \"the sonic wonders of the world\" 10 years ago, Cox began to ponder whether studying the acoustical properties of Stonehenge may help uncover some of its secrets. \"I realised there was a technique in acoustics that had never been applied to prehistoric sites before, and that was acoustic scale modelling,\" he said. \"I'm the first to make a scale model of Stonehenge or any prehistoric stone site.\"",

It is being featured, alongside a coded letter by Charles I's queen, in an exhibition on spying at the Cromwell Museum, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. The Parliamentarian cipher was discovered in papers in the Huntingdonshire Archives. Museum curator Stuart Orme said the exhibition gives \"an insight into the murky world of espionage\" in the 1640s. The Cromwell Museum Cromwell Museum in Huntingdon is housed in Oliver Cromwell's former school The cipher was used by Parliamentarian general Edward Montagu, Earl of Manchester, who lived at Kimbolton Castle. It had faded so badly that it was only when it was photographed and the resolution changed that archivists realised it was a cipher, said Mr Orme. The museum tells Oliver Cromwell's story from his Huntingdon childhood until his death as Lord Protector in 1658. Cromwell was initially the earl's second-in-command, and later helped bring about his resignation as commander of Parliament's eastern counties forces. Mr Orme said: \"The exhibition shows how ciphers and codes were used, how letter locking was deployed to stop people breaking into letters or to reveal if the letter was obviously tampered with. \"It's a tale of spies, invisible ink and assassination plots and includes a dagger on loan from the National Civil War Centre, Newark, of the sort used to stab to death several prominent Parliamentarians by Royalist agents.\" PA Media The coded letter was dictated by Henrietta Maria to her secretary and has a translation which appears to be in Charles I's own hand The UK Parliamentary Archives has loaned Queen Henrietta Maria's coded letter to her husband, Charles I, dated to 1643. It was captured by the Parliamentary side after their victory at the Battle of Naseby. The role that women played in intelligence gathering in this period is also highlighted in the exhibition. \"For example, Parliament Joan was known for being able to pass unobserved through Royalist encampments, seen as either a washerwoman or camp follower,\" said Mr Orme. \"17th Century misogynistic attitudes to women allowed them to get away with being agents and performing these tasks effectively.\" The Secret State: Cromwellian Spies and Intelligence opens on Saturday 20 May.",

Owner Barry Howard Homes has applied to West Northamptonshire Council for its demolition. One person commenting on the planning application described the listed building as a \"beacon of history\", the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.

Basil Brown spent almost his entire life in the Suffolk village of Rickinghall and largely taught himself the profession. A plaque was unveiled on Monday at the house where he lived for more than 40 years. It was organised by a small group of volunteers, known as Quatrefoil. The group was formed in 2012 to research the history of the Suffolk villages of Botesdale, Redgrave and Rickinghall. When Edith Pretty decided to excavate part of her estate at Sutton Hoo, near Woodbridge, Suffolk in 1938, she was advised by Ipswich Museum to call upon Mr Brown. He found a burial ship and a central chamber filled with pieces, including a warrior's helmet, a gold belt buckle, sword and shield, believed to have belonged to East Anglia ruler King R dwald. The discovery of the treasures was retold in Netflix film The Dig, where Ralph Fiennes took on the role of Mr Brown. Trustees of the British Museum Basil Brown was an archaeologist who worked for Ipswich Museum Cambridge archaeologist Charles Phillips, who took over the excavation once it became clear it was of huge significance, called Mr Brown \"a pure piece of rustic Suffolk\" in his book, My Life in Archaeology. Mr Brown's belief that his initial finds in 1938 were of a rich ship burial was confirmed in excavations led by Prof Martin Carver. Sarah Doig, chair of Quatrefoil, said: \"We are absolutely delighted that we now have such a visible recognition of our most famous resident. \"Basil is fondly remembered in the neighbourhood by all who knew him, and we are all proud of his many archaeological achievements. \"He was always generous with his time and expertise, inspiring the younger generation's interest in archaeology and local history.\" The plaque commemorates him as the discoverer of the Sutton Hoo treasures and an archaeologist and astronomer.

The egg was given to nine-year-old Sybil Cook from Neath for Easter in 1939. With war clouds looming, her uncle advised her to ration it and savour every morsel. Despite loving chocolate, she did not just ration it, but dutifully kept and treasured it for her whole life, until she died in 2021.

Having kept it safe through her childhood, she took it with her when she left home to get married in 1955 and for 60 years had it tucked away on a shelf in her bedroom. \"After we lost her, one of the care home nurses wrote a lovely tribute.

In most respects his story was no more remarkable than the thousands of other Welsh-Italians who made the same trip. Yet, 125 years on, his descendants still run Joe's ice cream parlour, a true Swansea institution. In the city the words \"Joe's\" and \"ice-cream\" are virtually interchangeable - so how did that happen? \"Right from the start of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-19th Century, Italians - in common with people from all over Europe - were being drawn to Wales in search of the jobs and lifestyle which the new technology and industry offered,\" said Rob Basini, a member of Amici Val Ceno (Galles), a group who organise social and charity events within the Welsh-Italian community in Wales. The group was set up to celebrate the links between Wales and the valley of the river Ceno, home of the northern Italian town of Bardi, from where many Italians emigrated. \"However, by the 1880s a series of very harsh winters and wet summers had caused the crops in Italy to fail... for people barely scratching a living off the land this was a life-or-death disaster, so the trickle to Wales became a procession.\" Many came on foot, spending a year or more to make the journey through France and stopping off to take seasonal jobs. Joe's Ice Cream Joe Cascarini borrowed money from his father Luigi to open Joe's in 1922 Mr Basini, from Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, recalls meeting a teacher on his return visits to Bardi, who would tell the pupils: \"You climb over the mountain, get down to the coast in Genoa, and then you turn right and keep on walking until you get to Britain.\" Once in Wales, some went to work in the mines and iron works, but many others found there was more money to be made from filling the gaps left by the relentless pull of manpower into heavy industry. In 1930 there were said to be 53 coal mines in the valleys compared with 54 Italian cafes and shops. So popular was one chain, the Bracchis, that the name remains a generic term for any cafe or corner shop the south Wales valleys to this day. Luigi Cascarini was just such an entrepreneur, selling coffee and roasted chestnuts from a barrow while the weather was cold and ice cream and lemonade during the brief Welsh summers. Joe's Ice Cream Parlour Joe's Ice Cream Parlour - pictured here in the 1940s - remains on the same site as when it opened in 1922 Now, with his brother Dominic, Luigi's great-grandson Adrian Hughes is Joe's current owner. \"The 1901 census lists Luigi as a musician, so possibly that was another string to his bow, entertaining his customers with a barrel organ or singing while they ate and drunk. \"By 1922 however he was well enough established in Wales to loan his son Joe the money to open a permanent ice cream parlour on St Helen's Road, where we are to this day.\" Mr Hughes said the only condition of the loan was that Joe did not open on the same street as the family members who had backed him. \"Of course, what did Joe do? Set up next door to our cousins, the Pelosis!\" Yet every success story needs a stroke of luck, and that's exactly what happened with the rise of the Temperance movement in the early 20th Century, which opposed drinking alcohol. Mr Hughes said: \"Joe wanted to make his experience as different from the pubs as possible. \"He wasn't much of a businessman, but he knew how to put on a show, with silver-plated cutlery, crystal glasses and bone china, all from Mappin and Webb. He paid a fortune for it!\" Adrian Hughes now owns Joe's Ice Cream Parlour, along with his brother Dominic When Luigi Cascarini died in 1936, thousands turned out for his funeral, with local newspapers extolling his contribution to Swansea, along with other Welsh-Italians, but disaster was just around the corner. After Mussolini declared war on Britain in June 1940, Winston Churchill ordered: \"Collar the lot\", and Italian cafe shop and restaurant owners were indiscriminately rounded up. They included BBC Wales Today presenter Nick Servini's great-grandfather Bartolomeo Rabaiotti who ran Rabaiotti's Cafe on Pontypridd's High Street. \"He was 59 and no threat to anyone, yet he was interned and put on a prison ship called the Arandora Star, bound for a camp in Canada,\" said Nick. On 2 July 1940 the Arandora Star was torpedoed by a German U-boat, and along with 800 \"alien prisoners\". Bartolomeo died. Joe's Ice Cream Parlour Luigi Cascarini's family lived between Rome and Naples Many could not escape because of barbed wire which had been erected around the deck. \"Like many of the Italians who'd originally come from mountainous areas, he couldn't swim, and the disaster left a long shadow over everyone in the community.\" Joe - who had lost a leg and an eye to diabetes - was considered safe enough to be kept prisoner on a farm in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire. Mr Hughes said this could have provided yet another stroke of good fortune in the tale of Joe's ice cream when his mother took over in 1969 and looked into the recipe - the amount of cream written down made it \"prohibitively expensive\" to make. \"The mystery is how he'd been able to get his hands on so much cream in the years immediately following the war - the only answer we've been able to come up with is that he forged some sort of black market connections with the people he met whilst interned in Llandeilo. \"Either way it's remained unique and massively popular to this day.\" Servinis Nick Servini waited tables at his uncle's cafe in Aberdare - pictured here in 1934 Nick Servini is the fifth generation of his family in Wales and grew up waiting on the tables of his uncle's cafe in Aberdare in the 1980s. \"Back then we'd return to Bardi every year for massive parties called Scampagnata, I suppose the nearest translation would be a picnic, but on a much grander scale. \"Back then they'd last six weeks, now it's more like a week.",

The hoard was found during a metal detecting rally at Hambleden in Buckinghamshire in April 2019. British Museum curator Barrie Cook said there had been only 12 known examples of the 1346 and 1351 Edward III gold nobles before the 2019 finds. The coins have been declared treasure by Buckinghamshire Coroner's Court. The British Museum Initially coin expert Barrie Cook was not sure if he was looking at one or two hoards Dr Cook, curator of medieval and early modern coinage, said: \"They are rare coins and your eyes light up when see something rare, and there's the whole background of the Black Death - it's a very active decade, to put it mildly, with a lot of historical context to unpack.\" The Hambleden nobles were the third attempt by Edward III to introduce the first gold coinage to England since the Anglo-Saxon era. It was not until the fourth attempt that \"the mint people worked out\" the right relationship between the value of the silver pennies and gold coins, he said. The British Museum They were also examined by British Museum conservators Hayley Bullock (left) and Rachel Weatherall The British Museum The hoard arrived at the museum sorted into plastic bags The hoard was unearthed by seven detectorists during Spring Detectival 2019, as first reported by the Bucks Free Press. Dr Cook said the pandemic delayed identification, while he was also faced by the puzzle of whether he was looking at two separate hoards - one of gold coins and one of silver - and \"until I look at them in detail, I couldn't make that judgement\". He is now convinced the same \"poor bloke or woman - it could have been a woman - put this very large sum of money in a hiding place and couldn't go back to it, so probably died\". The British Museum After the Norman Conquest, the only coins in circulation were silver pennies until Edward III decided to re-introduce gold coins The Black Death reached England in 1348 and it killed at least a third of the population. The hoard was deposited in two phases. First the silver coins, the latest of which was issued in the mid-1320s, and later the nobles were added. Dr Cook said \"people hid their money all the time as there were no banks\" and the owner was probably local. \"He might be an official running a manor or a priest, but he's not super rich either as the super rich didn't bury their money,\" he said. It was worth about  6, at a time when the king's officials had set Hambleden's entire tax assessment for a year at  5. The hoard will now go to the Treasure Value Committee to determine its value.",

Nick Bateman, 53, from Burston, Norfolk, made the find in a field he had nicknamed \"disappointment\" after regular searches revealed \"junk\". The earring was initially believed to be medieval but closer examination by an expert revealed it was Roman. It has been declared treasure and will be lent to a Diss Museum exhibition. The Portable Antiquities Scheme There is a tiny cross under the suspension loop on the earring which can be seen on the right Mr Bateman made the discovery in a south Norfolk field on Christmas Eve 2021. \"I'd done all the Christmas stuff so I thought I'd go out for a sneaky hour or two,\" he said. \"It wasn't the best signal in the world but I dug down three or four inches (seven to 10 cm) and saw what I thought was a gold metal bottle top, but when I cleared off the mud I realised I'd found gold and sunk to my knees in disbelief.\" Nick Batemen Mr Bateman said the \"disappointing field\" is now \"one of the best fields I've been in\" The builder took up the hobby seriously during lockdown in 2020. Guided by experienced detectorist Joe Edwards-Gill, he soon exceeded his mentor's experience. He said: \"Joe says, 'Nick's been detecting for five minutes and he's already got five pieces going through the treasure process and I've been detecting for 10 and only found one', so I do seem to be the luckiest person.\" Metal detecting and the law No search can begin until permission has been given by the landowner All finds belong to the landowner Any find in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that is more than 300 years old, made of gold or silver, or found with gold or silver artefacts, could be treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act These must be reported to the appropriate county finds liaison officer Source: Portable Antiquities Scheme Nick Bateman Border collie Badger accompanies Mr Bateman when he goes out metal detecting - always with permission from the landowner The \"fairly battered\" 20.5mm by 22.1mm (0.8in) earring was reported to the coroner and examined by numismatist Adrian Marsden from the Norfolk Historic Environment Service. \"A colleague thought it was medieval as he could see a tiny cross under one of the loops,\" he said. \"But when I looked closely I could see a laurel wreath and an eagle and that's exactly the sort of thing you get on Roman objects. \"Other artefacts like this had gone down as medieval, so it does show you need to keep your wits about you when you examine these things.\" The Portable Antiquities Scheme Close examination of the tiny battered object revealed a laurel wreath and an eagle, said numismatist Adrian Marsden The pattern was punched out on two discs of gold, which were soldered together. It would have had two loops, one to hang from a ear hook, while a now missing object would have been suspended from the second loop. Mr Bateman said the \"disappointing\" field has since yielded various artefacts currently being assessed through the treasure process.

But unlike other Victorian museums, the Manx Museum did not feature stuffed exotic animals and treasures from far-off lands. Instead, it showcased Manx history, and the story of the everyday people of the Isle of Man. Katie King, who curated a new exhibition marking the centenary, said that approach was \"ground-breaking\". The museum houses collections featuring natural and social history, archaeology, art, clothing and furniture, as well as the library and archives. Ms King said, in contrast to its contemporary Victorian museums, which were attempting to \"teach world history\", the Manx Museum was set up to \"educate island people about themselves\". Ordinary items were collected alongside more spectacular artefacts She said: \"Other museums were collecting from all over the world and we were just collecting ourselves, which might sound a bit naval gazing, but it wasn't because the world was changing so dramatically.\" Although the collections include \"really culturally significant objects\" like Captain John Quilliam's uniform from the Battle of Trafalgar, everyday objects like spinning wheels, butter bowls and things \"that you might keep on your fireplace\" were also kept, Ms King said. \"They were collecting ordinary things, and most importantly stories of ordinary people\", including songs and recordings of native Manx speakers and Manx dialects, she added. The uncovering of a skeleton of a giant deer helped the push for the museum to be created But the story behind the museum starts before 1922, as the gathering of some of the items featured in the collections goes back as far as 1879. That was when members of the newly-created Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society began the process of saving cultural assets \"in earnest\", Ms King said. Seven years later, under an Act of Tynwald, the Manx Museum and Ancient Monument Trustees were established to formally collect and preserve the history of the Manx people and the island itself, and come up with the concept of a national museum and funding for it. Ms King said that step was taken because it had been recognised that the \"material culture\" of the Isle of Man was \"vulnerable\" to being placed in foreign museums, sold to private collectors, or destroyed. But a decade on, with no progress made, frustrations began to arise among those who could see that cultural assets continued to be taken away from the island or treated with disregard. MNH PMC Kermode dedicated much effort to preserving and documenting the island's stone crosses The discovery of Viking silver during building works in Douglas in 1894, part of which ended up being dumped at a tip, fuelled the frustration of one man in particular, Victorian scholar Philip Moore Callow Kermode. Unbeknownst to those who found it, the Ballaquayle hoard was the largest single collection of Viking silver ever found on the Isle of Man. PMC Kermode, who led the antiquarians, was shown one of the coins and identified it as potential treasure trove, leading to a call from the chief constable for it to be recovered and handed in. The hoard was confirmed as Viking silver by the British Museum in London but was retained by the institution for safekeeping, as the island did not yet have its own museum. The Ballaqualye hoard remains the largest single collection found on the Isle of Man Ms King said PMC Kermode's anger at that loss and the attitudes of people to their own heritage, coupled with the discovery of the skeleton of a giant deer near St John's 1897, acted as the \"catalyst\" for a renewed drive for a Manx national museum. The skeleton was one of only two of its kind to be uncovered on the Isle of Man, the first having been claimed by the Duke of Atholl in 1819 and removed to Scotland. The finds also spurred the island's Lieutenant Governor John Henniker to step in, and in 1905 he allowed Castle Rushen to be used as a temporary home for the growing collections. But it was in 1921 that a deal was struck between the government and the Henry Bloom Noble Charitable Trustees for the former Noble's Hospital building in Douglas to gifted as a permanent site. PMC Kermode was appointed its curator and put in charge of transforming the building, which had closed as a hospital in 1912. Items telling contemporary stories are still being added to the national collections The Manx Museum opened its door to the public on 2 November 1922, with the very first object on the museum's register being a silver coin from Ballaquayle hoard, part of which had been returned to the island in advance of the opening. While the building itself has seen many developments and the way objects are made accessible changed to keep pace with modern wants over the intervening 10 decades, the ethos of the museum remains unchanged, Ms King said. \"The way we're trying to convey that the objects belong to the people of the Isle of Man and these are your stories is probably the same message that PMC Kermode wanted to say,\" she said. \"It's the same message, come and enjoy and celebrate your story, whether you've lived here one week or 100 years, it's your story.\"",

Like many Cajun families, his family ate what they harvested, hunted or preserved themselves. And like the Filipino settlers, Folse's grandfathers also sun-dried the shrimp. They caught them, threw salt over them and spread them on a table outside during the day and covered them at night. \"You see, [dried shrimp] was almost like a gift that just kept on giving through the season when everything else was out,\" he said. \"We could always count on the fact that we had preserved that particular ingredient.\" \"With bland vegetables like eggplants and squashes from our gardens, the dried shrimp were perfect for bringing that explosive flavour that we just couldn't get out of putting crab meat or regular shrimp into it,\" Folse added. \"Smoked sausages like smoked andouille were really, really expensive, and dried shrimp were available to us all the time.

Rising more than 30m high and sprawling 200m wide, the white mound spills into the azure sea and appears as if someone has dumped a massive pile of sugar atop the surrounding Estrecho Nature Park's protected green forest. Like all sand dunes, Bolonia is a constantly moving ecosystem that shifts with the winds. But as climate change has intensified the hurricane-force gusts coming from the east, the dune has increasingly migrated inland towards the ecologically important cork and pine forests and scrubland   revealing remnants of the many past cilivilisations who have passed through here in the process. Video: Spain's hidden Roman ruins In recent years, archaeological excavations have identified ancient burial tombs that were once hidden deep within the dune's depths. Experts aren't sure just how many chambers lie underneath, but because the sand has helped to preserve bones and the structure's foundation, the necropolis remains remarkably intact, yielding artefacts like jewellery and arrowheads. Nearby, the Baelo Claudia archaeological site dates to the 2nd Century BCE and is one of Spain's best-preserved Roman settlements. Complete with ancient baths, a theatre, temple, forum, aqueducts and sweeping views towards Morocco, the site was built atop a previous Phoenician settlement and was one of the empire's major sources of garum fish sauce production. After a 3rd-Century CE earthquake, the settlement was gradually abandoned, only to be discovered many centuries later under the sand.

        "content": "Newcastle: Historic images show 'how we used to live' 20 November 2022 Share Save Duncan Leatherdale BBC News Share Save Newcastle Local Studies Library/Tyne Bridge Geordie Newcastle by Fiona Kay and Neil Storey celebrates pictures of the city's past Amateur historian Fiona Kay spent three years scouring and scanning thousands of pictures from a library archive covering the history of Newcastle and North East England. Ahead of a book festival talk on her findings, she has shared some of her favourite images with the BBC. Deep in the bowels of Newcastle's City Library is a cold storage room brimming with boxes. Some contain negatives on plastic film, others large glass plates dating back to the mid-1800s when photography was in its infancy. All were of interest to Fiona Kay, who works in admin for a company by day and is a keen historian by night (well, at the weekends). In 2017 she started making regular visits to the library's archives, pulling out box after box and scanning the contents. Before the coronavirus pandemic curtailed her efforts in 2020, Ms Kay had scanned some 5,000 pictures, properly cataloguing many of them for the first time. Neil Storey/Fiona Kay Fiona Kay has written Geordie Newcastle with her partner Neil Storey, and both are keen historical reenactors \"There is just so much history squirrelled away that does not see the light of day,\" Ms Kay from Cramlington said. \"I was especially interested in the social history, seeing the people and what they were wearing and doing, looking at the cars and carriages, the shops and how they have changed.\" With the support of the library, she and her partner Neil Storey, who is a professional historian, collated dozens of pictures for a book, Geordie Newcastle: How We Used to Live, published by Tyne Bridge Publishing. On Monday, Ms Kay will give a talk at the library as part of the Books on Tyne festival. She is hopeful of one day getting back into the library's archives, estimating she has only scanned a third of its contents. \"It's both daunting and exciting,\" Ms Kay said. Here are some of her favourite images. Newcastle Local Studies Library/Tyne Bridge Newcastle viewed across the Tyne from The Rabbit Banks in Gateshead The first picture shows a view of Newcastle as seen from The Rabbit banks in Gateshead across the Tyne in about 1890. \"In those days the river was lined with working factories, wharves and warehouses and the industries caused smog to hang in the air over the city,\" Ms Kay said. Newcastle Local Studies Library/Tyne Bridge A view of Castle Garth with Dog Leap Stairs from about 1890 Ms Kay's second picture shows a view of Castle Garth and Dog Leap Stairs also taken in about 1890. \"Although there was a certain Dickensian charm about it, the living conditions within these old buildings were often squalid and unsanitary and many folks simply did not have the money to move out from them,\" she said. Newcastle Local Studies Library/Tyne Bridge A line of people wait for free soup Ms Kay said she especially liked finding pictures of people, such as the above image showing a line of \"hard-up folks\" waiting for free food from the St Ann's soup kitchen in 1912. Newcastle Local Studies Library/Tyne Bridge Eldon Square in 1933 was an area of calm in the city, Ms Kay said Visitors to Eldon Square today will find a busy shopping area, but in 1933 it was still surrounded by Georgian houses. \"It was an area of tranquil calm in the city centre,\" Ms Kay said. Newcastle Local Studies Library/Tyne Bridge Northumberland Street in 1925 Northumberland Street, as seen in the above picture in 1925, formed the \"shopping heartland\" of Newcastle along with Grainger Street, Ms Kay said. Newcastle Local Studies Library/Tyne Bridge Newcastle's Bigg Market in 1930 The Bigg Market is perhaps best known now for its varied bars and nightlife, but in 1930 it was a popular market. \"This area always seemed to be bustling with small crowds, not only visiting its shops or as visitors to events held at the old town hall, but they were also drawn to the market stalls, notably Risi's and Mark Toney's ice creams,\" Ms Kay said. Newcastle Local Studies Library/Tyne Bridge Sandhill in 1895 Ms Kay said she liked pictures showing people going about their business, as seen in the above picture of Sandhill in about 1895. \"In the foreground are the carriers horses, carts and shelters but it was a stiff old climb for the hand barrow carters who transported goods from Quayside to Toon,\" she said. Newcastle Local Studies Library/Tyne Bridge Hadrian self-service store as seen in 1954 The above picture showed Newcastle advancing into the modern age in the 1950s, Ms Kay said, with Hadrian grocery shop in Wallsend offering the revolutionary idea of self-service. \"The concept of a self-service shop was still new to the British public who were used to asking at a counter and being served with goods they wished to purchase,\" Ms Kay said.",

        "content": "amon Phoenix: The historian who became a national treasure 19 November 2022 Share Save Mark Simpson BBC News NI Share Save PA Media  amon Phoenix was a regular contributor to a wide range of media organisations After the historian Dr  amon Phoenix died he was described by many as a \"national treasure\". It was a recognition of his standing within academia and broadcasting - a voice of authority when explaining the complexities of Irish history. He was particularly prominent in recent years due to the centenary of the establishment of Northern Ireland after the partition of Ireland in 1921. Amongst the tributes on social media after he passed away at the age of 69, the phrase \"national treasure\" came up again and again. Political commentator Alex Kane wrote: \" amon was the loveliest of men, as well as being both ferociously well informed and relentlessly modest. Many of us had already awarded him 'national treasure' status.\" Knowing  amon, he would have blushed at the national treasure description. His inquiring mind may also have responded with a smile and a question \"which nation\"?  amon's work on Irish history often concentrated on the whole question of nationhood and national identity, particularly around the period from the 1916 Easter Rising to partition and the formation of Northern Ireland five years later.  amon Phoenix with Mark Simpson at Northern Ireland's Public Records Office It was a pivotal chapter in history, as Irish republicans battled to cut ties with Britain, while unionists resisted. One of the ways  amon illuminated that period was by concentrating on the people, as well as the politics of the time. In his many broadcast interviews and lectures, he focused on the personalities of key political figures like Edward Carson and James Craig on the unionist side, and Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera on the republican side. He talked about their strengths and weaknesses, their physical characteristics, their families and even their childhood. To understand the politician, you need to know the person, he often said. The micro helps to explain the macro. At the same time, he enjoyed numbers. When it came to dates, he was a human encyclopedia. I once interviewed him for BBC television for 45 minutes and he only stopped once, to double-check a date which he had just spoken about. It turned out, he had been right first time. Speaking of dates, he had a fascinating take on when Northern Ireland was formally established. Officially, 3 May 1921 is the designated day. The centenary of that date was marked last year as part of the government's programme of events to mark the 100-year anniversary. PA Media  amon Phoenix was a regular contributor to a wide range of media organisations In his characteristically gentle way,  amon argued there were a number of other possible dates. He pointed out that the legislation which partitioned Ireland was given royal assent the previous year, even though it did not come into effect until May. He also highlighted the fact that the Irish border was not legally confirmed until the Boundary Commission completed its work in 1925. I remember interviewing him for BBC News NI in the back garden of his home in south Belfast on this very subject. Such was his public appeal, a subsequent clip of him talking about the issue on Twitter received 37,000 views. Not bad for an historian. He was popular on the TV and radio airwaves, and it was the same during his career in education. Doc Phoenix's lessons Before becoming a lecturer at Stranmillis University College in south Belfast, he was a teacher. One of the schools he taught in was St Malachy's College in north Belfast. It is said that some pupils, who used to sneak out of school to avoid classes, would creep back in later in the day for a lesson if Dr Phoenix was teaching history. He was known in the corridors of the school as 'Doc Phoenix'. At home, away from the spotlight, he was known as a devoted husband, father and grandfather. A photograph of him and his wife Alice on their wedding day in 1980 was on the order of service at his funeral, at St Brigid's church in south Belfast. A photograph of Dr Phoenix and his wife Alice on their wedding day in 1980 was on the order of service at his funeral Parish priest Father Edward O'Donnell told mourners: \"In spite of his extraordinary academic workload, and his commitment to so many projects,  amon's first thoughts were always about his family.\" After the service, friends shared their memories of him. He was an historian who did not just have expertise, but the gift of communication and a wonderful turn of phrase. This allowed him to share his knowledge in a way that was easy to listen to, and crucially, to understand. That is why many said they regarded him as a national treasure.",
