    "Introduction": "Historical sources say that this country was ruled by many kings and a few queens in the ancient time. Historical sources describe that prince Vijaya who came from India was the first king who ruled this country. He arrived in this country in the 6th century B.C. The archaeological evidences have substantiated that there had been settlements in this country even before the arrival of prince Vijaya. The ancient burial grounds discovered in the areas such as Beragala and Haldummulla have proved that an agricultural society had been in a developing state in this country from 2400 B.C. There must have been a certain ruling system in such a society for it to exist without any chaos. Therefore, the history of evolution of political power in the society of this country belonged to the period before the arrival of prince Vijaya. The authority to rule a country is entrusted to a king or a queen by the people of that country. Whoever it is, he or she needs people’s consent to rule a country. The history has taught us how some rulers, who ruled the country under people’s dislike, did not have the ability to rule the country for a long time. As a ruler had the consent of the majority of people to rule a country, the word ‘Mahasmmatha – general will’ had been used to introduce such a king in the eastern countries in the ancient time. The ruling land reigned by a king or a queen on the people’s will (Jana sammathaya) and the various officials who were engaged in ruling and the people is called a state.",
    "3.1 Pre-state Era and Decentralized Power": {
      "3.1.1 Pre-state Era (Parumakas)": "According to the interpretation given above, the foundation of a state in the Sri Lankan history developed at a later time. It has been described in the next parts of this lesson. Here, the attention has been paid to explain the nature of the ruling system that existed in Sri Lanka before it became a state. That period is called **pre-state era**. There was no one definite ruler to rule this country during the pre-state period. Instead, a group of wealthy chieftains dominated their power over small areas. At the beginning of writing inscriptions in this country these chieftains were introduced in them by the name of **‘Parumaka’**. The word ‘Parumaka’ is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Pramukha’. Its meaning is ‘main’. They were given the power to rule a large or a small area based on the power they possessed as a result of their wealth. There is an inscription, which assists us to show that the Parumakas had a certain provincial power, in Kothgalakanda in the Kandalama area close to Dambulla. That inscription belongs to 250 B.C. A Parumaka who offered a cave to the bikkus has been introduced as “Thota Bojaka”. Its meaning is “Theerthaya Anubhava Karanna”. ‘Theerthaya’ means ‘the port’. The word \"anubhava kirima” was used in ancient language to mean “collect taxes and enjoy properties”. It can only be done by a person who has a ruling power. It is clear that the Parumaka mentioned in the Kandalama inscription was one who ruled that area. Therefore, he had the ability to offer a cave to the Buddhist monks. By examining how the Parumakas came into being, we can easily understand the way in which the political power of this country evolved. In order to understand that, the ancient rural society in this country and its operation should be meticulously studied.",
      "3.1.2 Village-Level Administration (Householders and Gamikas)": "**Householders**:\nAt least by 900 B.C. the rural settlements of this country had spread in many areas in the dry zone. These villages consisted of several families. Perhaps between 1 to 30 families lived in those villages. In the ancient time the word ‘Kula’ was used to mean a family. The chief of all these families was called ‘Gruhapathi’. In the inscriptions made in 250 B.C and later, the word **'Gahapathi'** was used for them. An inscription in which there is important information regarding that was discovered in the area called Periyapuliyankulama. It says that “a householder who was engaged in metal trade, had cleaned a cave and offered it to the Bhikkus for their comfort”. Those householders offered themselves in common activities in a village representing each family. In simple terms, the householders meant chiefs of the families.\n\n**The Gamikas**:\nThe ancient inscriptions as well as the annotations have mentioned a group of people called ‘Gramika’ or **‘Gamika’**. They were the chiefs of the ancient villages. The one, who acted representing each village in the affairs between villages such as marriages, exchanging goods, as well as solving problems, was named as Gramika. Its meaning is the chief of the village. A chief, to represent a village, was selected among the householders. In the selection, the priority may have been given to the wealth and the possessions of the householders. The Jathaka Attakathawa tells us a story of borrowing a bag of paddy by a poor man, who lived in an ancient village, from the Gamika in the same village on the promise that he would return it on the following season. It reveals that Gamikas were rich enough even to help others. Providing leadership to the common activities in the village was especially important among the tasks done by the Gamikas. Maintaining the tank of the village and distribution of water from it was prominent among his tasks. It is clear that a ruling power was built around him as a result of solving problems in villages, giving leadership to the activities and the wealth he possessed. The origin of such chiefs of villages was a decisive milestone in developing the political power of this country.",
      "3.1.3 The Emergence of Parumakas through Tank Systems": "The notion of all the scholars, who have studied about this fact, is that there was a relationship between the emergence of the chieftains and the maintenance of ancient **tanks**. The ancient villagers followed a successful method to address water scarcity challenges: they constructed a system of tanks by connecting a few tanks, which existed closely, through canals. This system is known as **‘Ellangawa’** (prolapsed tanks). In constructing tank systems they connected such independent tanks with each other according to the contour lines of water flowing. The most powerful person among the Gamikas had acted to represent all villages of the tank – system. This person was called by the name of **‘Parumaka’**. Since the Parumakas had the power to take decisions on behalf of the welfare of the people who lived in several villages belonging to the tank- system, they were considered to be a group of important chieftains. Women were also engaged in provincial administration on some occasions, called **‘Parumakalu’**. The evolution of political power in Sri Lanka started as a divided system, called **‘decentralized ruling’**. The Parumakas sometimes went to the extent of introducing themselves in the term of ‘King’, such as Pochani Raja ('the king of the eastern region')."

    "3.2 Growth of Kingship and State Centralization": {
      "3.2.1 Centralization of Power": "The growth of kingship means **centralizing the power** which was decentralized. This means that power comes under one person, creating the concept of the state. The ruling head is the king and he has a specific territory under his ruling. The first king to centralize power was **King Pandukabhaya**, who ascended to kingship by fighting provincial rulers, selected Anuradhapura as his ruling centre, and marked rural borders. The need for centralization grew during the ruling period of **King Devanampiyatissa** due to expanding trade affairs in the Indian Ocean, requiring the country to act as an independent unit. His acts, such as planting the Sri Maha Bodhi and maintaining relationships with Emperor Ashoka, reflected the need to build unity among regional rulers. **King Dutugemunu** was another pioneer in centralizing power, receiving support from the Parumakas, who were later appointed to positions like **Senapathi Parumaka** (army generals). **King Wasabha** made the centralization more successful, ruling Sri Lanka as one unit, systematizing tax collection, and separating administrative districts (asthana).",
      "3.2.2 The Concept of State and Kingship": "The king, created by the centralized political power, is an an extremely powerful person who appeared in a majestic form. The rulers' duty included developing the economy (e.g., constructing irrigation), providing security, and enhancing spirituality (e.g., building religious places). Different concepts about kingship developed: **Devathwa** (god-like, e.g., King Mahasen as God of Minneri, King Kutakanna Abhaya as Nareshvara), **Bodhisathwa**, **Parvatharaja**, **Veerathwa**, and **Chakravarthi** (Universal Ruler, e.g., King Nishshankamalla). All these concepts were used to show the superiority of the king and create a conceptual background for a righteous ruling.",
      "3.2.3 Inheritance of Kingship": "Kingship was inherited from **brother to brother** (e.g., Devanampiyatissa to his brothers, Dutugemunu to Saddhatissa) or most frequently from **father to son** (e.g., Kawantissa to Dutugemunu, Vasabha to Vankanasikatissa). The eldest among the younger brothers or the king’s elder son/consort’s elder son became the heir. Conflicts arose when the typical order was not followed (e.g., King Kashyapa usurping the throne from his father, Dhathusena).",
      "3.2.4 Statecraft and Official Structure": "The King was named **‘Mahaparumaka’** or **‘Mapurumuka’** (head of all Parumakas) and later **‘Maha Raja’**. The centralized state administration had a formal structure of officials, including: **Chief Minister** (Maha Emathi/Mahamatha), **Ministers** (Emathiwaru/Ametha), **Commanders** (Shenapathi), **Treasurer** (Bhandagarika), and various specific officers (e.g., Officer in charge of customs, Administrator of the city, Officer in charge of horses/tuskers, Officer in charge of making coins). This official structure provided assistance to the country’s administration."

    "3.3 Great Kings Who Ruled This Country": {
      "3.3.1 King Dutugemunu's Contributions": "King Dutugemunu rendered great service to organize the political power. He acted to save Mathota international harbour and unite the country by defeating King Elara. He provided leadership to the first organized fighting movement, motivated by the benefit of Buddhism. His statesmanship was shown when he ordered his subjects to respect his defeated rival’s tomb. His most important political contribution was combining the **Parumakas** (decentralized provincial power) and becoming the anointed king (**Maha Raja**). He worked for the welfare of the people, such as ordering alms halls (Dan Sel) and paying workers during the construction of Ruwanweli Stupa.",
      "3.3.2 King Vasabha's Contributions": "King Vasabha pioneered in constructing **large scale tanks** for the first time (sixteen mentioned in chronicles), driven by the high demand for grains in South India. This was a productive decision to address an international need. He regulated internal administration, divided the country into **provinces**, and systematized the process of **collecting taxes**. He also reconstructed Buddhist temples and Stupas, providing financial support to facilities for the Bhikkus.",
      "3.3.3 King Vijayabahu I's Contributions": "King Vijayabahu I suppressed the power of the **Chola** through war to protect the **territorial integrity** of the country. He grew up in Ruhuna, receiving protection from a public officer named Sithnarubima Budhal Na. After uniting the country, he renovated Buddhist temples and made the major shift of the ruling centre from Anuradhapura to **Polonnaruwa**. This shift was strategic because international trade had moved to the Eastern Indian region, and ruling from Polonnaruwa allowed easy control of the important **Trincomalee harbour** (Gokanna Thiththa), which faced the Eastern part of the South Indian ocean. His actions preserved the sovereignty of the country."
