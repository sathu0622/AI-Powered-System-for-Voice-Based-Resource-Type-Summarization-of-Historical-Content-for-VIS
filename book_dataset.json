        "content": "Introduction Historical sources say that this country was ruled by many kings and a few queens in the ancient time. Historical sources describe that prince Vijaya who came from India was the first king who ruled this country. He arrived in this country in the 6th century B.C. The archaeological evidences have substantiated that there had been settlements in this country even before the arrival of prince Vijaya. The ancient burial grounds discovered in the areas such as Beragala and Haldummulla have proved that an agricultural society had been in a developing state in this country from 2400 B.C. There must have been a certain ruling system in such a society for it to exist without any chaos. Therefore, the history of evolution of political power in the society of this country belonged to the period before the arrival of prince Vijaya. The authority to rule a country is entrusted to a king or a queen by the people of that country. Whoever it is, he or she needs people’s consent to rule a country. The history has taught us how some rulers, who ruled the country under people’s dislike, did not have the ability to rule the country for a long time. As a ruler had the consent of the majority of people to rule a country, the word ‘Mahasmmatha – general will’ had been used to introduce such a king in the eastern countries in the ancient time. The ruling land reigned by a king or a queen on the people’s will (Jana sammathaya) and the various officials who were engaged in ruling and the people is called a state.",

        "content": "Pre-state Era According to the interpretation given above, the foundation of a state in the Sri Lankan history developed at a later time. It has been described in the next parts of this lesson. Here, the attention has been paid to explain the nature of the ruling system that existed in Sri Lanka before it became a state. That period is called pre-state era. There was no one definite ruler to rule this country during the pre-state period. Instead, a group of wealthy chieftains dominated their power over small areas. At the beginning of writing inscriptions in this country these chieftains were introduced in them by the name of ‘Parumaka’. The word ‘Parumaka’ is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Pramukha’. Its meaning is ‘main’. They were given the power to rule a large or a small area based on the power they possessed as a result of their wealth. There is an inscription, which assists us to show that the Parumakas had a certain provincial power, in Kothgalakanda in the Kandalama area close to Dambulla. That inscription belongs to 250 B.C. A Parumaka who offered a cave to the bikkus has been introduced as “Thota Bojaka”. Its meaning is “Theerthaya Anubhava Karanna”. ‘Theerthaya’ means ‘the port’. The word 'anubhava kirima' was used in ancient language to mean “collect taxes and enjoy properties”. It can only be done by a person who has a ruling power. It is clear that the Parumaka mentioned in the Kandalama inscription was one who ruled that area. Therefore, he had the ability to offer a cave to the Buddhist monks. By examining how the Parumakas came into being, we can easily understand the way in which the political power of this country evolved. In order to understand that, the ancient rural society in this country and its operation should be meticulously studied. Householders At least by 900 B.C. the rural settlements of this country had spread in many areas in the dry zone. These villages consisted of several families. Perhaps between 1 to 30 families lived in those villages. In the ancient time the word ‘Kula’ was used to mean a family. The chief of all these families was called ‘Gruhapathi’. In the inscriptions made in 250 B.C and later, the word 'Gahapathi' was used for them. An inscription in which there is important information regarding that was discovered in the area called Periyapuliyankulama. It says that “a householder who was engaged in metal trade, had cleaned a cave and offered it to the Bhikkus for their comfort”. Those householders offered themselves in common activities in a village representing each family. In simple terms, the householders meant chiefs of the families. The Gamikas The ancient inscriptions as well as the annotations have mentioned a group of people called ‘Gramika’ or ‘Gamika’. They were the chiefs of the ancient villages. The ancient villages existed separately. A belt of jungle area separated one village from the other. Because of this separation the people who lived in each village thought about the villages as ‘our village (the village where they live)’, neighbouring village (adjoining village) and the outside villages (the villages existed far away). The one, who acted representing each village in the affairs between villages such as marriages, exchanging goods, as well as solving problems, was named as Gramika. Its meaning is the chief of the village. A chief, to represent a village, was selected among the householders. In the selection, the priority may have been given to the wealth and the possessions of the householders. The Jathaka Attakathawa tells us a story of borrowing a bag of paddy by a poor man, who lived in an ancient village, from the Gamika in the same village on the promise that he would return it on the following season. It reveals that Gamikas were rich enough even to help others. To control a group properly, the person who has won the common trust of that group should provide the leadership to it. Our ancient villagers had acted to appoint the richest and the most powerful person as the chief of the village in the Map. 3.1. The tanks in the villages were connected through canals in order to widen the use of small tanks which obtained rain water. The word ‘prolapsed-tanks’ is used to introduce that kind of a tank-system. The people in the dry zone of Sri Lanka use the word ‘Ellangawa’ to name it. This map shows that kind of a ‘prolapsed tank existed in Hambantota district. agreement of the householders instead of taking decisions by all the householders in the village getting together. Buddhagosha Thero has mentioned in Samantha Pasadika that the Gamika was one who was appointed among the householders themselves. Providing leadership to the common activities in the village was especially important among the tasks done by the Gamikas. Maintaining the tank of the village and distribution of water from it was prominent among his tasks. It is clear that a ruling power was built around him as a result of solving problems in villages, giving leadership to the activities and the wealth he possessed. As the chiefs of those villages acted mutually with each other, they were able to maintain the peace and the co-existence between the villages. An evidence to prove this was discovered in a cave in the area called Korawkgala belonging to the ancient Buddhist temple situated in Sithulpawwa in Hambanthota district. Three people had participated in cleaning that cave and offering it to the Bhikkus; they were Gamika Siva, Gamika Sumana, and Gamika Thidana. These three people must have been the chiefs of the neighbouring villages adjacent to Sithulpawwa. The origin of such chiefs of villages was a decisive milestone in developing the political power of this country. The Parumakas We mentioned earlier that a group of chieftains called Parumakas was important regarding the development of the political power in the society of this country in the ancient time. Here, it is important to find how such kind of a class of chieftains emerged and how power was claimed by them. The notion of all the scholars, who have studied about this fact, is that there was a relationship between the emergence of the chieftains and the maintenance of ancient tanks. Certainly, how did that happen? In about 900 B.C. the settlements spread in the dry zone mainly around small tanks. These tanks received water from rain. Normally, the water in those tanks was enough for 10 or 15 families who lived in a village for their day-to-day needs for a short time period. In annual dry seasons the water in those tanks ran dry. We can say that the people might have faced difficulties in such times by the experiences faced at present by the people of the dry zone. The problem of not having adequate rain water collected in the tanks arose not only due to the dry climatic condition. With the passing of time more water was needed due to the increase of population in villages. Since they had to cultivate more lands in order to produce more food for the increasing population, collecting more water was essential for them. Our ancient villagers, who faced such difficulties a number of times, followed a successful method to address those challenges: they constructed a system of tanks by connecting a few tanks, which existed closely, through canals. There were two objectives in it; the first one was conserving water by carrying water to a tank situated below from a tank situated up when it overflowed during the rainy season; the second was increasing the dampness of either side of the land of a canal by sending water constantly through the canal between the two tanks. They were able to cultivate crops easily by increasing the dampness in such a manner. Even today the ruins of such tank systems could be seen in the dry zone. The word ‘prolapsed tanks’ is used to name such kind of a tank system. People in the dry zone call it ‘Ellangawa’. The origin of tank – systems was not merely a process of connecting a few tanks; something important was happening behind it. Earlier we mentioned that the villages were situated separately in the dry zone. Further, we said that there was a tank in each and every village. In constructing tank systems they connected such independent tanks with each other according to the contour lines of water flowing. Therefore, it was natural for the chiefs of the villages to discuss and there emerged the need of taking important decisions regarding connecting tanks in their villages. When the most ancient inscriptions are read meticulously, it can be seen that the most powerful person among the Gamikas had acted to represent all villages of the tank – system. This person was called by the name of ‘Parumaka’. Since the Parumakas had the power to take decisions on behalf of the welfare of the people who lived in several villages belonging to the tank- system, they were considered to be a group of important chieftains in the then society. Even today ruins of hundreds of such tank – systems could be seen in the plains in the dry zone. It is clear that there was a Parumaka for each tank – system during the time they were used. There is information on hundreds of such Parumakas in inscriptions. Not only men, but also women too were engaged in provincial administration on some occasions. Such women were called in the name of ‘Parumakalu’. As a whole, all of them were people who ruled the small land units in the areas where settlement had spread in the dry zone. Accordingly, the evolution of political power in Sri Lanka started as a divided system. The best word that can be used to name such a method is ‘decentralized ruling’. In this manner, the Prumakas who exercised the provincial ruling in this country were so powerful that sometimes they went to the extent of introducing themselves in the term of ‘King’. An ancient inscription in the area called Embul Ambe in Matale district mentions a provincial ruler called Pochani Raja which means 'the king of the eastern region'. Pochani means ‘Pracheena (oriental)’. There is another note about such another provincial king named ‘Duhathara Raja’ in a cave in the ancient Buddhist temple called Yatahalena in Kegalle. The word ‘king’ gives the meaning of ‘one who makes others happy’. Therefore, the word ‘king’ is used to refer to ‘one who works for the people’s welfare diligently and make them happy. As the Parumakas acted in such a manner, later they were named thus. The origin of a generation of brave kings, who ruled Sri Lanka, occurred in such a background. Growth of Kingship The growth of kingship means centralizing the power which was decentralized. Centralizing political power in a country means a country being united. This means that power comes under one person. When the power is centralized, the concept of state is created. Its ruling head is the king and he has a specific territory under his ruling. According to historical sources, the first king who ruled this country was King Pandukabhaya. According to the description given in Mahawamsa, king Pandukabhaya, 1. ascended to kingship by fighting several provincial rulers (his uncles) and captured those areas. 2. selected Anuradhapura as his ruling centre and built up the city of Anuradhapura. 3. marked the rural borders during his tenth year after the accession to kingship. The need of centralizing the political power was gradually emerging by the ruling period of king Devanampiyatissa. One of the main reasons that influenced this was the trade affairs growing in the Indian Ocean. It was not only because of the geographical location of Sri Lanka, which was situated in the middle of the sea trade route that connected western countries with the eastern countries, that it became an important to the international traders. Gems, tuskers, and spices that Sri Lanka possessed had become attractive commodities for them. In joining this emerging international trade, the need of working as an independent country arose. Therefore, the then powerful provincial rulers had understood the need of bringing the country into a unitary rule. Mahawamsa says that king Devanampiyatissa had invited the Kshasthriyan (the clan of trade)in Katharagama and Chandanagama to participate in the ceremony of planting the Sri Maha Bodhi. Not only that, we know the king took steps to plant a branch of Sri Maha Bodhi in various parts of the country. By this act it becomes clear that the king had thought of the need of building affability among the regional rulers. Holding coronation of King Devanampiyatissa again by using the five insignia of royalty sent by the powerful emperor king Ashoka who ruled India and using the title ‘Devanampiya’ of emperor Ashoka, arrival of Mihindu thero bringing Buddhism to Sri Lanka are facts that reflect the nature of relationships maintained with the countries in the Indian oceanic region. King Dutugemunu was another pioneer in the process of centralizing the decentralized political power of Sri Lanka. The king received the support of the Parumakas for that. Examples to prove this can be seen in the inscriptions belonging to his ruling period. The army generals who extended their support to King Dutugemunu to unite the country had worked as Parumakas before they were given the above mentioned posts. The names of the army generals such as Velusumana, Pussadeva, Theraputtabhaya, and Nandimithra were mentioned in the inscriptions as Parumakas. Several such inscriptions can be seen in the caves in Situlpawwa. King Dutugemunu obtained the support of such Parumakas and centralized the power, which was decentralized so far. The regional chieftains, who were the Parumakas during the time when the power decentralized, became persons who held different posts after the power was centralized. The names of Parumaka Pussadeva, Parumaka Velusumana, Parumaka Therputtabhaya later became Senapathi Parumaka Pussadeva, Senapathi Parumaka Velusumana and Senapathi Parumaka Teraputtabhaya. These changed names could be seen in contemporary inscriptions. Further, the inscriptions provide us information about the treasurers, cashiers, and storehouse keepers who held the post of Parumaka earlier. According to literary sources, King Dutugemunu was the first king to unite the whole country. King Dutugemunu took a very effective step to centralize the power in ancient Sri Lanka. Historical sources say that a Sri Lankan ambassador had been to Rome and brought glass beads with him when he returned during the ruling time of king Bhathikabhaya. King Wasabha made the centralization of the political power more successful. During his time Sri Lanka was ruled as one unit. The inscriptions established by king Wasabha had spread in a wide area in this country. Further, separating administrative districts (asthana) and appointing ministers to administer each district too were done during his ruling time. It has been written in the golden plate, ‘Wallipuram’ that the Jaffna area was ruled by a minister named Srishigiri appointed by the king in his time. During that time Jaffna peninsula was known as Nagadeepaya (Nakadiva). Sri Lanka could stand as an independent country before the world because of its centralized political power",

        "content": "The Concept of State The king, created by the centralized political power, is an extremely powerful person. Therefore, the king had appeared before the people in a majestic form. The rulers thought their duty was developing the country economically, providing security to the countrymen, and enhancing spiritual development of the people. Providing security on the occasions of threats from foreign enemies, developing the economy by constructing irrigation and enhancing people’s spirituality by building religious places were some examples. The history provides evidence to prove how even kings such as Elara and Nisshankamalla, who had foreign origin, acted in the above described way and won the trust of the people. Different concepts about kingship developed according to the actions of the king and the way that they attempted to appear. Accordingly, concepts like Devathwa, Bodhisathwa, Parvatharaja, Veerathwa, and Chakravarthi were applied to the kings. Most frequently the king appeared either as a Bodhisathwa or as a god. The king Kutakanna Abhaya, who made the inscription in a rock in Dambulla temple, has introduced him by the name of ‘Nareshvara’ (Naraisera). Its meaning is god Eeshwara for humans. King Mahasen was worshipped as God of Minneri due to his service of developing the economy by constructing irrigation works. Even today there are Devalas in the dry zone dedicated for God Mahasen. King Kashayapa I appeared as Kuwera. The name ‘Alakapaya Maha Raja’ had been used to call him. The meaning of it is ‘Alakamandadhipathi – Maha Raja’. ‘Alakamanda’ is the living place of the god ‘Kuwera’ who is in charge of wealth. Literary sources say that ‘Alakamanda’ was a huge rock. The rulers in ancient Asia followed the method of appearing in the concept of ‘Parvatharaja’. The king, appearing as a Bodhisathwa was another instance. The king showed, on one hand, that he was bound with responsibility to rule the country in a just and fair manner for the benefit of the people and, on the other hand, it reflected that the people should trust and respect the king. Another view that the kings of this country held was the concept of ‘Chakrawarthi’. Chakrawarthi is a concept which conveys the meaning of ‘dominating the whole world’. That word belongs to the Sanskrit language and in Sinhala it is used as ‘Sakvithi’. Some rulers in this country had used this word to show their identity in the 8th and 9th centuries A.D. Specially, king Nishshankamalla used the line “Kalinga Chakrawarthi Swaminwahanse” to introduce himself in his inscriptions. Though there were various terms about the kingship, all of those concepts were used to show the superiority of the king. When such type of nobleness is applied to the ruler, the people expected him to be exemplary. It is natural for him to be persuaded to act as that. That is how the conceptual background was created, which is essential for a righteous ruling. Inheritance of Kingship When we study how the kingship was inherited in ancient Sri Lanka, it seems it passed from brother to brother or from father to son. After the demise of king Devanampiyatissa, his brothers ascended to the kingship. After king Dutugemunu, his brother Saddhatissa became the king. When the kingship was given to a brother, the eldest among the younger brothers of the king was given power. When it was not so, history provides evidence to the fact that there were conflicts for the kingship. What was frequent was passing the kingship from father to son. After king Kawantissa, prince Dutugemunu became the king; after king Vasabha, his son prince Vankanasikatissa became the king. In this way passing kingship from father to son can be seen throughout the history of Sri Lanka. Either king’s elder son or the consort’s elder son became the heir. There are evidences that there were conflicts when it was not so. We know that king Kashyapa usurped the kingship from his father, king Dhathusena. The king had to do so because prince Mugalan, who was the son of then king’s consort, was the real heir to the throne. The mother of prince Kashyapa was a second queen of king Dhathusena. Apart from this, there were occasions when the kingship went to the brother of the king’s consort and the son of the king’s sister. It happened so when there was no real heir as described above. Statecraft During the time when the political power was decentralized many of the Parumakas were combined together and built the state. The king acted as the head of all the Parumakas. Therefore, the word ‘Mahaparumaka’ or ‘Mapurumuka’ was used to name the king. We earlier mentioned how some powerful Parumakas used the name ‘king’ before the power was centralized. But, after the centralization of political power in the country, the word ‘Maha Raja’ was used to name the ruler of the country. By referring to the most ancient inscriptions of this country, we can fairly understand the structure of the officials, who belonged to the state administration which developed after the centralization of the power in Sri Lanka. The king – Maha Raja (Mapurumuka), Chief Minister – Maha Emathi (Mahamatha), Ministers – Emathiwaru (Ametha), Commanders (Shenapathi), Treasurer – Bhandagarika (Badagarika), Officer in charge of the Dining Hall – (Bathagu), Officer in charge of customs –(Kothuruge na), Administrator of the city -(Nagaragutika), Architect of the city (Nagara Wudika), Officer in charge of the horses (Asa Adeka), Officer in charge of tuskers (Hathi Adeka), Officer in charge of dramas (Nata Adeka), Officer in charge of making coins (Rupa Adeka), Officer in charge of trades (Pana Adeka), Officer in charge of archives (Kanapedika). This kind of official structure provided a good assistance to the administration of the country. Common people were ones who benefited much from this.",

        "content": "Great Kings Who Ruled This Country From the facts discussed so far, you must have understood how the development of the political power in Sri Lanka was influenced by a socio – economic process. Specially, the rulers who, had understood that they needed an efficient centralized ruling more than a decentralized one if they wanted to gain the due benefits from international trade affairs afoot in the Indian Ocean during the latter part of the 1st century B.C, took necessary steps for that. In this part it is expected to discuss the policies and contributions of the rulers who ruled this country, in parallel to the development of political power in Sri Lanka, citing several kings as examples. King Dutugemunu King Dutugemunu, who is highlighted in the historical sources, was a ruler who rendered a great service to organize the political power in this country properly. The king understood the need of saving Mathota international harbour, which earned a good income because of the trade affairs which was prospering in the Indian Ocean during his time, from the then king Elara who had usurped the power in Anuradhapura and uniting the country. The way that prince Dutugemunu acted for that purpose according to the advice and the plans of King Kavantissa, his father, was a landmark in the political history of this country. Prince Dutugemunu was the first to provide leadership to the first organized fighting movement in the history of this country. The statement that he made about his fight against King Elara, which he would do, not because that he wanted to enjoy comforts and the facilities of a king but because for the benefit of the Buddhism clearly shows how the ruler entered to the political process based on a common purpose on behalf of the country. After the battle, the king ordered his subjects to respect his defeated rival’s tomb, which shows his statesmanship. As we have explained in the part ‘growth of kingship’ of this lesson, the most important contribution that King Dutugemunu made to the process of development of political power in this country was managing to combine the Parumakas who had possessed the decentralized provincial power by then. At the end he possessed a great power after being anointed as the king (Maha Raja) of the country. Though he was so powerful, his redressing attitudes towards the people reflect that he could realize his prime responsibility which was to work for the welfare of the people. The best example for this is that during the construction period of Ruwanweli Stupa the king ordered to run alms halls (Dan Sel) at the four gates of the Stupa and make payments for everyone who had participated in its construction works. King Dutugemunu should be admired not merely for his service to Buddhism of this country. Taking initiatives to organize the decentralized political power in Sri Lanka is also a prominent feature among his tasks. King Vasabha King Vasabha, who was the first ruler of the lineage (dynasty) of Lambhakarna, was a prominent character among the rulers of this country. The procedure that the king followed to regulate and to organize the internal administration of the country properly was exemplary. There are a number of inscriptions that he has established around the country. According to the information in them, the king tried to divide the country into provinces and regulate the administration. And also, inscriptions say that the process of collecting taxes of the state was made systematic during the king’s time. The details of the historical sources reveal that King Vasabha pioneered in constructing large scale tanks in this country for the first time. The Wamsakatha (chronicles) say that the king had constructed sixteen large scale tanks. The king tended to execute such kind of construction as there was a great demand for the grains produced in this country in South India because there was a dearth of food in the valley of Krishna river in South India. The immediate decision king Vasabha took to invest the public money on constructing new reservoirs can be analyzed as a far-sighted and a productive decision to address an international and regional need emerged at the time. The way that king Vasabha acted to reconstruct the Buddhist temples and Stupas in this country is not second to any other ruler’s task. A number of inscriptions mention the financial support the king provided to reconstruct the decayed places in Buddhist temples and to supply facilities to the Bhikkus. We should understand that the decisions that the king made to make the lives of the people better in the country by taking steps needed to increase the local income and using the income earned in that manner to develop the irrigation of the country are exemplary. King Vijayabahu I King Vijayabahu I is another prominent and a great ruler who belongs to the history of this country. The king acted to suppress the power of Chola through a war movement planned in a very intelligent manner during a period in which Sri Lanka was under the Chola ruling for a long time after the growth of power of the Chola kings in South India. The King was called Keerthi in his childhood and grew in Ruhuna area. The royal family including prince Keerthi and his parents were given protection by a public officer who lived in Ruhuna. He was Sithnarubima Budhal Na by name. He was a security officer. An interesting description of the way that Budhal Na provided protection to the royal family is included in the Panakaduwa copper plate which had been got written by king Vijayabahu I. All the steps taken by king Vijayabahu I to act against the powerful Chola kings was an effective fruitful procedure followed to protect the existence of the whole territory in the country. The concepts of freedom of territory in any country and continuity are called territorial integrity. The protection of the territorial integrity of a country by a ruler is a prime responsibility of him for the citizens. The king, who united the country by defeating the Chola rulers through a fighting movement, took much pain to develop the country. He acted immediately to renovate the Buddhist temples which were not maintained properly during the period of the Chola ruling. The king took a very important step to strengthen the economy of the country; that is, making Polonnaruwa his ruling centre instead of Anuradhapura. The king took such a step because the international trade based on the Western areas of India by then had been transferred to the Eastern Indian region. With that transferring, what was very important for Sri Lanka was to organize the administration in a way in which maintaining the relationships with Eastern region of India could take place easily. Though ex-rulers had paid their attention on this before, king Vijayabahu I was the one who acted practically regarding the matter. One of the main reasons that appear to have affected to select Polonnaruwa as the ruling centre was the Trincomalee harbour, which was named Gokanna Thiththa during that period, was located facing the Eastern part of the South Indian ocean and he understood that controlling of the trade affairs of that harbour could be done easily from the Polonnaruwa ruling centre. The way king Vijayabahu I acted as a ruler influenced much on the history of Sri Lanka during the Polonnaruwa period. The sovereignty of this country, which was preserved until it was threatened by the Europeans, was a result of the intelligence and great ideas of the rulers of that time.",

        "title": "Settlements in Proto-historic Era",
        "content": "The period between the end of the prehistoric era and the beginning of the historic era is named as the proto-historic era. This was an era of technological transition. It is differentiated from the preceding prehistoric era by practices such as using burnt pots and following a methodical burial system. The use of iron began, replacing stone tool technology, which was completely abandoned during the final stage. This era is therefore called the proto-historic Iron Age or the early Iron Age. Other significant transformations include the beginning of building permanent settlements and starting agriculture.The Origin of the Proto-historic Era: Current knowledge on the transition period is limited. The shift from stone tools and hunting to plant food dependence and iron use could not have happened suddenly, but required a strong cause, likely influenced by long-term geographical changes. Experts point out that a climatic change affecting the South Asian region occurred between 7000 – 4500 B.C. (the middle of the recent geo period or Holocene era), creating a suitable environment for agriculture due to increased global temperature. This led to a considerable increase in population and a new social style. The oldest proof of Sri Lanka's proto-historic era belongs to 2400 B.C. Clearer archaeological proof has been discovered in the north-eastern part of the Sabaragamuwa province and the south-western part of the Uva province. The megalithic burials constructed for the dead are a prominent source for studying this culture.  These burials, made out of stone splinters in the shape of squares, were covered with huge stone slabs, forming cist burials where pots containing human remains were deposited. Excavated examples include Ibbankatuwa, Galsohonkanaththa, and Yatigalpoththa, dating between 750 and 450 B.C. Other megalithic burial methods include ‘urn burials’, where remains were deposited in a clay urn. In Beragala and Haldummulla (Uva province), a different method was used: human skeletons were cremated, and the remains were deposited in a boat-shaped tub made out of raw clay which was then burnt well, ensuring its preservation.The Nature of the Settlements: The main feature of this era is that people abandoned the hunting livelihood of the pre-historic era and built permanent settlements (sedentism). The major evidence for this characteristic is the remnants of houses, such as a rectangular house ($10.20\text{m} \times 6.80\text{m}$) discovered in the village of Udaranchamadama (Rathnapura district) in 2009. The walls of this house were made of wattle and daub and the roof was thatched with materials like ‘Iluk’.Life Style: Evidence regarding the general life style is limited as excavations have mainly focused on burial grounds. However, the residential excavation at Udaranchamadama (house built around 3000 years ago) assists in understanding this period. Inside the house, numerous potsherds were discovered, including many painted potsherds (white background with painted red lines) indicating they were made using a potter’s wheel. The kitchen contained both stone tools and iron tools. Since many of the tools were stone, it appears that using iron was a new experience at the time. Bones of hunted animals like deer, cattle, wild boar, and giant squirrel were also found, indicating that although they adopted an agricultural life style, they did not completely abandon hunting. Other finds included clay beads, an iron stick for applying kohl, and two grinding stones used to rub yellowish and reddish ochre, showing that women were interested in beautifying their body.Technology: The proto-historic era marked the transition to metal technology and clay pot making. The introduction of iron allowed them to perform day-to-day activities efficiently, such as clearing jungles, digging the ground, and ploughing. The painted clay pot from Udaranchamadama reflects the high technological standard of clay item production. The start of building houses gradually increased related technology, including specialized techniques for setting the foundation to prevent sinking and building walls levelled to the ground. The discovery of a clay bead shows the existence of a highly skillful bead-making technology.",

        "content": "Information on the early settlements of the historical period in Sri Lanka is mentioned in both historical and archaeological sources, the latter providing a definite understanding of the expansion of ancient settlements. The early historical period was between 450 B.C. and 300 A.D. The main index for settlement expansion was the presence of thousands of ruined small village tanks.  In this period, the majority of settlements existed mainly close to a tank, with villages typically located at one end of the bund.Factors that Influenced the Expansion of Settlements: The primary factor was the geophysical background, including annual rainfall, soil nature, geo diversity, natural resources, and drainage. Early settlements spread in the dry climatic condition (Dry Zone: $1000 – 1250\text{ ml}$ annual rainfall; Arid Zone: less than $1000\text{ ml}$). Despite the difficulty in receiving sufficient water year-round, they expanded in the dry zone due to its fertile red-brown soil. Water for agriculture came primarily from monsoon rain and rivers during dry seasons. Using river water required constructing anicuts and canals, tasks demanding labour, time, and technology, leading them to save water by constructing tanks. Detailed studies show that early historical settlements expanded outside the river valleys, not within them, because a suitable technology to control catastrophic annual floods was initially lacking. The control of floods by constructing anicuts across rivers and routing water to tanks began at the end of the 1st century B.C. or during the 1st century A.D. For instance, King Ilanaga (33 -43 A.D.) constructed the Tissamaharama tank and built an anicut across the Kirindi river. The word ‘Avarana’ (meaning ‘Amuna’ or anicut) is inscribed on Brahmi inscriptions.The Structure and the Nature of Settlements: The settlements were centralized on small tanks fed by rainwater, making them independent. Settlements developed around a tank were called ‘Vapigama’ in literary sources (e.g., ‘Sumanavapigama’, ‘Viharavapigama’, ‘Hundirivapigama’, and ‘Kadahavapigama’ in Mahawamsa). Villages were separated by a jungle-belt. Historical sources also describe villages based on different types of professionals: Kasikaragama (farmers), Manikaragama (gem mine workers), Gopalagama (cowherds), Kewattagama (fishermen), Kumbhakaragama (potters), and Vadtakigama (carpenters). Villages also existed based on tasks: Pattanagama (close to harbours), Niyamgam (trading villages), and Olagam (villages around tanks deserted by people).Settlement Size and Administration: The size of settlements varied based on natural resources, but archaeological evidence suggests a small scale village was not more than 0.15 hectares, a medium scale rural settlement was about 2 hectares, and a large scale urban settlement was more than 2 hectares. A village usually housed 5 or 6 families, though literary sources mention up to 30 families in some large-scale villages. Urban settlements were much larger; by the 6th century A.D., the population of ancient ‘Magama’ and adjacent urban settlements was calculated to be around 35,000. Villages protected by a fence were called ‘Parikkitta Gam’, while those without were ‘Aparikkita Gam’. Vast urban settlements were called ‘Pura’ (city). The title ‘Pura Kamatha’ (main architect) is mentioned in a Brahmi inscription (250 B.C.). The word ‘Nurupura’ was used to introduce Anuradhapura in the Panakaduwa copper plate. Ancient inscriptions mention intermediate settlements called ‘Nakara’ or ‘Nagara’, which were slightly bigger than a village and coordinated the trading of commodities between villages and big cities. The organization and administration of these settlements were systematic even before the early historical era. The family was the most important feature of a village, represented by the chief householder, known as 'Gahapathi'  in Brahmi inscriptions. The chief of the village was called ‘Gamika’ or ‘Gramika’. Later, a panel of ten chief householders (‘Dasa Gam Eththan’) solved administrative issues for an area of ten villages, as mentioned in an inscription at Kaludiya Pokuna temple regarding the supply of ‘Dane –Alms giving’.Housing: Foundations of ancient rural houses discovered in Anuradhapura show walls made of wattle and daub and roofs thatched with leaves. Some houses were round shape, others had square foundations, with archaeologists finding only pits for the pillars. Marks of an ancient house found in Walagampaththuwa in Tissamaharamaya show the floor was set by digging the ground and applying clay on the surface, scientifically proved to be used in the 3rd century A.D.Means of Subsistence: The means of subsistence for people living outside the overflowing river valleys was chena cultivation.  They cultivated dry zone chena crops like Kurakkan, Meneri, sesame, and Thanahal, which have short root clusters and are drought-sustainable. They constructed basic village tanks to increase food production due to population growth. The shift of early historical settlements from areas outside the river valleys into river valley settlements is reflected in a study done in the Kirindi Oya valley.",

        "title": "Settlements in the Pre-historic Era",
        "content": "The period before the past described by literary sources is commonly named as the ‘pre-historic era’. Two cultural stages belong to the pre-historic era of Sri Lanka: the first was the Stone Age, which existed for a long time, and the second was a transitional period showing a greater tendency towards depending on herbal food, the use of metals, and the beginning of permanent settlements. The term pre-historic era is used to introduce the Stone Age, and the term proto-historic era is used to introduce the second period.Expansion of Settlements: Settlements in Sri Lanka were made by the early Homo Sapien man, who expanded his living in a wide geographical area by adapting to different climatic zones. Their main dependency method was gathering food by roaming and hunting. Evidence belonging to the Stone Age is found in many places. The first is Rathnapura and the surrounding gem mines, where stone tools and the bones of some extinct animals are deposited in gravel layers (called lode) about 90 feet deep. These gravel layers were caused by the erosion of mountainous regions during the Pleistocene geographical era. Additionally, a gravel layer covered with sandy soil mixed with clay in the semi-arid zone, named the Iranamadu formation, also contains Stone Age tools.  The Iranamadu formation was deposited during the short warm periods of the Pleistocene era.The Expansion of Settlements in Different Climate Zones: The Stone Age community lived in 6 main environmental zones: (A) Semi-arid zone, (B) Lowland dry zone, (C) Lowland intermediate dry zone, (D) Wet Zone, (E) Mountainous dry intermediate zone, and (F) Arid zone. The differences in annual rainfall levels were crucial, as rainfall directly affects the available animals and plants. This resulted in differences in food consumption and technology among the people. For example, the Stone Age community in the lowland wet zone mostly used oysters living on the land as food, where different types of oysters were abundant. Conversely, in the lowland dry zone, animals mostly living there, such as deer and iguana, were hunted.Time Periods: Evidence of the Stone Age has been scientifically dated. The gravel layer belonging to the Iranamadu formation in Pathirajawela (Hambanthota district), 45 feet deep, was proved to be 125,000 years old. A gravel layer found at Bundala, Wellegangoda, 24 feet deep, belongs to a period of 80,000 years back. Approximately, this Stone Age existed continuously from before 125,000 years up to 1800 B.C. minimum. The longevity of this culture is confirmed by evidence found in several provinces with varying dates: Pahiyangala (38,000 years), Kuruwita Batadombalena (28,000 years), Kitulgala Belilena (15,000 years), Bellanbendipelassa (12,000 years), Attanagoda Alulena (10,350 years), Maniyamgala (7,900 years), Sigiriya Pothana (5,800 years), Sigiriya Aligala (5,500 years), Udamalala (5,330 years), and Mathota (3,800 years).Key Features of the Settlements: The prehistoric man adapted to diverse environmental conditions, preferring places with abundant natural resources for food, easy availability of water, and various types of stones for tool making. They lived in and around lowland rain forests, dry zone forests, coastal lagoons and creeks, and hill country grasslands. They lived in open areas during the dry season and in natural caves during rainy seasons. Several discovered prehistoric outdoor camps and cave habitations include Minihagalkanda, Bundala, Pathirajawela (Outdoor camps in coastal areas); Pahiyangala, Batadombalena, Kithulgala Beli Lena (Lowland wet zone caves) ; Pothana and Aligala in Sigiriya (Lowland dry zone caves); Bellanbendipelessa (Outdoor camps in lowland wet zone); and Bandarawela, Horton plains (Outdoor hunting places in hillside areas).Life Style: People of this era lived a mostly nomadic life by hunting and gathering food, roaming from place to place throughout the year. During heavy rainy seasons, they lived in natural caves. Their population consisted of small groups, normally comprising 15–25 members, with the maximum believed to be around 50. It is estimated that an area of 50 square metres was enough for a family of five members. For instance, the Church Hill site at Bandarawela is 150 square metres, assumed to have housed 25 people, and the Stone Age site at Bellanbendipelassa is 120 square metres, where 30 human skeletons were discovered. The food consumed depended entirely on the resources available in their local environment. During the dry season, they built temporary camps in open areas. They walked a distance of about 7 kilometres per day searching for food. Due to their temporary life in caves, they sometimes buried the dead bodies of their relatives inside the cave, digging a pit with a piece of horn or a stick and covering it with garbage. Twelve skeletons buried in this manner were discovered in the cave of Belilena in Kithulgala. The graveyard of Bellanbendipelessa, an open area, contained 30 skeletons, and 9 skeletons belonging to different ages were found in Pahiyangala cave.Food Style: Evidence of the diet is found extensively in the caves of both the lowland dry and wet zones. They hunted animals such as gaur, buffalo, black bear, wild boar, deer, spotted deer, porcupine, hedgehog, hare, stag, giant squirrel, mongoose, wild fowl, monkey, civet cat, and iguana. They also caught and ate fresh water fish for protein, especially small fish in natural water pools in the lowland wet zone. For starch, they mainly consumed plant foods like wild breadfruit and wild plantains. Evidence in the cave Belilena in Kithulgala suggests wild breadfruit seeds had been baked and eaten 12,500 years ago. Other starch-rich foods included yams like ‘Gonala, Katuala’, seeds of ‘Kithul’, and the kernel of ‘Dothalu’, with evidence showing food had been eaten after being baked. Prehistoric people frequently ate snails, specifically tree-snails and oysters living in lagoons. Those living inland went far to obtain salt, as remnants of lagoon oysters found in Kithulgala Belilena were mixed with salt brought from coastal areas.Technology: The primary proof of technology from this era is stone tools. It is difficult to form a complete picture based solely on the tools from Rathnapura gem mines and the Iranamadu Formation due to the scarcity of samples and limited knowledge of their timing. However, the small-sized stone tools, called geometric micro stone tools, are crucial. They are named for the geometric shapes given to them and are typically not more than 4.5 cm in length. They were made mostly using quartz and a little of ‘Kahanda’ stones.  Non-geometric micro stone tools were made for purposes like hunting, cutting, scratching, chopping, and digging. Additionally, some tools such as hammers and grinding stones were made using granite.Nature of People’s Physical Body: Skeletons reveal the stature of the Stone Age people: the average height of a grown male was 174 cm, and a grown female was not more than 166 cm. They possessed big teeth, a wide nose, and a chin. The size of the brain of a grown male was $1600\text{ cm}^3$, and for a grown female, it was $920\text{ cm}^3$. Anthropologists estimate their maximum lifespan was about 35–40 years.Rituals: Information on rituals is clearest regarding the burial of dead bodies. An excavation in the cave of Rawana Ella (close to Badulla) revealed a man’s skull, perforated, with the rough edges rubbed smooth, and one side painted with red ochre. Parts of human skeletons painted with red ochre found in the cave in Pahiyangala show that the dead bodies were first buried and kept until they decayed, and the skeletons were later dug out and buried back (secondary burial). Skeletons discovered in the cave called Batadomba Lena in Kuruwita had been curled and buried. Researchers note a number of cultural and biological similarities between the Stone Age people and the aborigines (Vedda community) in Sri Lanka.",

From then on, they spread themselves in various parts of this country, adapting to different environmental conditions. As they lived for a considerably long period, their culture also changed over time. Based on these cultural changes, the history of human existence in Sri Lanka has been divided into three stages: the Pre-historic Era, the Proto-historic Era, and the Early Historic Era.",

        "title": "Classification of Sources History",
        "content": "Classification of Sources History is a subject which studies the past human activities. When we study the history of hundreds and thousands of years back, we find writings and various creations made by people who lived in those ages. They are called ‘sources’ because information about past human activities can be extracted from them. The sources, which belonged to each different age, provide us a good understanding about those eras and their social backgrounds. Thus, when the information taken from those sources are studied logically, the history about people’s lives in each period is formed. As there are a number of sources which are available to study history, they are mainly divided into two; Literary sources Archaeological sources Books and documents written at different time periods by the people who lived in the past are considered ‘literary sources’. Relics, monuments, coins, inscriptions and various ruins which are unearthed from archaeological excavations and experiments are called ‘archaeological sources’. Next, let’s discuss the above mentioned two types further using the sources which are helpful to study the history of Sri Lanka. Literary Sources The literary sources, which can be used to study the history of Sri Lanka, can be categorized into two, as, ‘local literary sources’ and ‘foreign literary sources’. The texts, written by Sri Lankans in the form of prose and poetry from time to time about two thousand years ago are considered ‘local literary sources’. Apart from the texts written by Sri Lankans, some books were written by foreigners who were interested in Sri Lanka. Or else, some foreign writers have included information about Sri Lanka in the books they wrote. Thus, the books written by foreign writers mentioning information about Sri Lanka are called ‘foreign literary sources’. Local Literary Sources Among the local literary sources in Sri Lanka ‘Deepawamsa’ is considered the oldest text. Deepawamsa was written in about 4th century A.D. Deepawamsa consists of historical information of this country up to the end of King Mahasen’s ruling period and descriptions of the history of the Buddhist order (Sasana) in this country. But, some historical events have been recorded briefly in Deepawamsa. Repetitions too can be seen in this source. Therefore, Mahawamsa was composed as a historical chronicle with lesser mistakes than Deepawamsa. Mahawamsa is a text with several parts. The first part of it was written by a Bhikku named ‘Mahanama’ who lived in the ‘Diksanda Seneviya’ Piriwena (monastery). As in Deepawamsa, the first part of Mahawamsa consists of the historical information of this country from the arrival of the Lord Buddha to Sri Lanka up to the end of the ruling time of king Mahasen. This part had been written in about 5th or 6th century A.D. One can see a certain similarity between the information of Deepawamsa and the first part of Mahawamsa. The reason for this may have been the influence of the early texts such as, Seehala Attakatha Mahawamsa, Uttara Vihara Attakatha and Vinaya Attakatha which were written before these two sources. After the first part of Mahawamsa was written by Mahanama Thero, some other writers extended Mahawamsa as a continuous text with several parts by including some information about their contemporary time periods from time to time. Therefore, the history of Sri Lanka has been written continuously in Mahawamsa. As there are a limited number of countries of which the history has been written in one continuous text, Sri Lankans can be proud because the history of this country has been written in one text. Mahawamsa is considered a more credible historical source because some historical events recorded in it have been substantiated by the inscriptions and some other sources. About four centuries after the writing of Mahawamsa, in Pali, an annotation was compiled in order to interpret it by explaining some areas. That text, which is called the ‘Mahawamsa Teekawa’(annotation of the Mahawamsa), is named as Wansattappakasini. It consists of a lot of information which are not available in some other sources. A number of books, which can be considered to be local literary works, had been written from Anuradhapura era to Kandyan era of the history of this country. The books, considered as Buddhist religious texts such as Bodhiwamasa, Thupawamsa, Dhatuwamsa, Poojawaliya and Saddharmalankaraya, are important to study the history of Rajarata civilization. The Nikaya Sangraha which has been written on the history of the Buddhist order(Sasana) and Rajawaliya which includes political information of the country are important sources of studying history from Gampola to Kotte period. Sandesha Kawya, Prashasthi Kawya and Hatan Kawya are important to study the history between the periods of Kotte and Kandy. Some examples are given in the table No 1.1. The local books were written during different periods and the reasons which influenced to write them too are different. The books which had been written from Anuradhapura era to the beginning of Kotte era have had religious objectives. Some books were written a few centuries after the historical incidents, which have been mentioned in the same books. Therefore, when we form our history using the literary sources, we have to pay our attention to the facts given below. The time in which the sources were written The author of the source The author’s objectives The way in which facts were obtained for the source Therefore, you may understand that you have to be clever when you refer to the sources. Foreign Sources As Sri Lanka maintained trade relations with foreign countries from early period of Anuradhapura era, many foreigners who were engaged in trade activities in the Indian Ocean were aware of this country. Therefore, the foreigners, who had written from the period of B.C, have included some information about Sri Lanka in their books. From ancient time there was a good relation between Sri Lanka and India. Therefore, some Indian books have mentioned information about Sri Lanka. Some Tamil books, such as Seelappadikaram, Manimekalayi and Padirruppattu written in India too have information about Sri Lanka. Some foreigners tended even to write books with separate information about Sri Lanka after the arrival of the Portuguese in this country in the 16th century. When we examine the foreign sources consisting information about Sri Lanka, we can clearly see that there had been writers who came to Sri Lanka and studied and wrote about it as well as writers who didn't visit Sri Lanka but inquired information about Sri Lanka from others and wrote. Uses of Literary Sources To prepare the historical chronology. To obtain information about political, economic, and social affairs in each era. To substantiate the information provided by one source with another source. To study the international relations of a country (in this regard foreign sources are very important).",

        "title": "Archaeological Sources Archaeological",
        "content": "Archaeological Sources Archaeological sources can be divided into a few categories such as epigraphy, coins, ruins, drawings, sculptures and antiquities. Epigraphy Epigraphy is a word used commonly to introduce writings on stones (Shila), clay slabs, walls, copper plates, golden plates, wood, and on various urns. Writings on stone slabs or rocks are called ‘Sellipi / Shilalipi’ inscriptions. Inscriptions (Sellipi) According to the shapes of the stones on which writings have been inscribed, the inscriptions can be categorized as cave inscriptions, rock inscriptions (Giri Lipi), pile inscriptions (Tam Lipi), slab inscriptions (Puwaru Lipi) and seat inscriptions (Asana Lipi). The oldest inscriptions in this country are named ‘Brahmi inscriptions’ and they were written to record the events such as offering of caves to Bhikku. These inscriptions are important to understand the history of the ancient society and the expansion of settlements. Writing of inscriptions had continued from the 2nd century B.C. to the period of Kandyan kingdom. After the 2nd century A.D. inscriptions were established to write records on various events such as offering premises to temples, administrating temples, informing government laws to people, charge taxes, trading, forgiving convicts, and appreciating the service of some people. Therefore, much information, which is not provided by the literary sources can be discovered from the inscriptions. Coins Coins were used in Sri Lanka from Anuradhapura era. The oldest coins found in this country are called ‘ Kahapana’. The names ‘Purana’ and ‘Dharana’ too are used for them. The tusker and Swastika coins, Lakshmi coins and a type of golden coins named ‘Aka’ were used in this country. The copper coins (Thamba Massa) were used during the Polonnaruwa kingdom. The coins needed for the country were produced in the country itself and even the moulds which were used to produce coins have been discovered in excavations. Apart from the local coins, Roman coins, Chinese coins, and Indian coins are found in Sri Lanka. In studying the economic condition, trade, and use of metals, coins are an immensely important source. The study of ancient coins is called ‘numismatics’. Ancient Ruins Many ruins such as ancient buildings, stupas, stone pillars, tanks and ponds can be seen in Sri Lanka. Since some places, where ancient people of this country lived are still in wilderness, such ruins exist even in and close to the forestry areas. These ruins, which are called archaeological monuments, are a very good source to study the history of this country. These ruins help us to gain a clear knowledge on various aspects such as creative ability, technology, building designing or architecture, craftsmanship, ability to conserve the environment and water management of the ancient people. Drawings, Sculpture and Antiquities Ancient drawings, sculpture and engravings are live evidence that display our culture. Drawings, sculpture, and engravings are helpful to gain information about various aspects of the ancient people such as their clothes, art skills, use of jewellery, using colours, and religious beliefs; for example, the frescos in Sigiriya provide us some information about clothes, jewellery, hair styles and beauty culture of women who lived during ancient times. The objects which are remaining now, after being created or used by the ancient people can be introduced as antiquities. Antiquities are in the museums, religious places, and various institutions and in care of some people of this country. Many antiquities are discovered in excavations. Antiquities help us to understand many different aspects of the ancient people, such as their abilities, skills, ancient culture, technology, foreign relations and their life style. You may see that there are diverse sources which can be used to construct the history of Sri Lanka. In constructing the history with the help of the information extracted from a particular source, one has to be shrewd in using that source. Historical sources in Sri Lanka are past reports rather than past events. And also there is a possibility of including the personal likes and dislikes of the authors of these books into the sources. Archaeological sources are mostly considered as contemporary ones to the historical events. Accordingly, if the information mentioned in the literary sources is substantiated by the archaeological sources, that information can be considered credible. In constructing history regarding a certain historical incident, all sources relevant to that incident should be used. Next, after analyzing the various information received from the sources critically, history should be constructed by using the most credible information. Accordingly, archaeological sources are useful to fill up what lacks in the literary sources, to obtain new information and to substantiate the information mentioned in the literary sources.",

There is a possibility of these valuable sources getting destroyed due to speedy urbanization, expansion of settlements, constructing roads, constructing buildings, and agricultural activities happening in the country. Today we see historical places, monuments and antiquities because our ancestors had protected them.

        "title": "The Nature of Ruling",
        "content": "The Nature of Ruling The historical sources say that kings ruled our country in the ancient times. The inscriptions mention very important information about the procedure of the statesmanship followed in ruling the country. There are three institutions which handle the ruling of any country. They are called the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. The government means these three institutions. The legislature is the institution which makes laws in a country. As it is done by the parliament of our country today, in the ancient time it was done by the king’s court. The executive is the institution which implements laws. The government officers are engaged in that process. The judiciary provides the justice to the countrymen by preventing the damage caused to the society due to breach of law. In the ancient time there were an executive as well as a judiciary in our country. The executive acted as the legislature too. There was not an independent body as a separate legislature, because then there was monarchism in this country. The inscriptions written in 9th century A.D. had used the word ‘Ekthensamiya’ to name the executive and the legislature. In an inscription in the place called Buddhannehela there is a note which could be put into words such as “Apa methuwak dena awud wathhimiyan wahansege wadala ekthensamiyen”. The word ‘Ekthensamiya’ is formed from the words ‘Eka asthana’ and ‘Samya’. The word ‘Eka asthana’ means ‘king’s court’ and ‘Samya’ means ‘agreement’. Hence, the word ‘Ekthen Samiya’ gives us the meaning ‘agreement of the king’s court’. The inscription Buddhannehela was established to make a statement of an offering of a land. The phrase of the inscription mentions that the offering was made with the agreement of the king’s court and due to the decree of the king. The phrase “Wath himiyan wadala” means the “king’s decree”. The word ‘Wathhimi’ is a similar word to king.
According to the inscriptions that belong to the 9th century A.D., the officers, who came to grant the land of the government to the Buddhist temples, had represented a place called ‘sabhava – the council’. As mentioned in one of the inscriptions found in Anuradhapura district the officers named Udaya in Meningamuva and Sena in Nikawella had come representing the council (Sabhawa) to offer a plot of land called Kerelegama to the nunnery called Mahindarama. It goes like this in the inscription, “Sabhayen a meningamu udahi isa nikaweli senu isa”.

Here the word ‘Sabhawa’ means the judiciary existed then. It is a legal act to bequeath land of the government to another. Therefore, the participation of the officers, representing the judiciary, in such occasions was essential. On such occasions demarcating the borders of the given land and documenting the conditions that should be followed in enjoying the land must have been the duty of the officers.

In the literary sources the word ‘Mahale’ has been used in several places instead of the word ‘Sabhawa’. That was how the old Sinhala word ‘Maha Lekhaka – great writer’ was written. It is similar to the meaning ‘Maha Lekam – general secretary’. The duty of the secretaries of the government was to document all governmental affairs and take necessary steps to preserve them. An inscription found in Medirigiriya mentions about such a general secretary. The inscription says that a general secretary (Mahale Kasba) called Kashyapa had come to offer a land to a Padhanaghara called Eth Wehera in Medirigiriya and to do the legal affairs of it under the decree of King Sena II.

When Anuradhapura was the capital of the country, it was the ruling centre too. The king ruled the country from the capital. It is clear that as there were no transportation and communication facilities like today, therefore handling the administrative affairs of the remote areas from Anuradhapura was difficult. There are facts that can be seen in literary sources about separate administrative units related to the government for provincial administration because of the above reason. An example which can be given for that is the golden plate - ‘Vallipuram’ written in King Vasabha’s ruling period. It has been mentioned in the document that a minister called Rishigiri, who ruled Nagadeepa during king Vasabha’s ruling period, built a temple called Piyangukatissa there. This clearly shows the manner in which the officers of the central government had been appointed to rule the outer areas.

Apart from these, there were independent councils, which were at lower levels to administer each area. In the inscriptions, those independent councils, which existed in 9th century A.D., have been introduced as ‘Dasagam Ettan’. The heads of them had participated in the administrative affairs at a minor scale, representing ten villages. An inscription situated in an old temple called Kaludiya Pokuna in Matale district says that if there was a problem regarding offering alms to the temple, Dasagam Ettan should gather and solve the problem.

In administration, the rulers of the country acted for the welfare of the people. They not only offered grants to the temples, but also acted for the betterment of the countrymen. Especially, the rulers frequently paid their attention to uplift the health facilities of the general public, which was essential to them. The word ‘Vejjasala’ has been used in ancient literary sources. That word means ‘hospitals’. The inscriptions made in the 2nd century B.C. mention about doctors who were called ‘Veja’.

King Buddhadasa (340 – 368 A.D) was a ruler who made a great effort to build hospitals. King Mahinda V (982 – 1029 A.D) acted to provide everything required to the hospitals in various provinces in the country then. During the reign of king Kashyapa IV (898 -914 A.D) a dangerous fever spread in and around Anuradhapura. Historical sources say that the king who realized that those patients could not be treated under the facilities available in the hospital existed then, built a special hospital for that. For that the word ‘Upasaggaroganasa’ was used in the sources.

King Upatissa I (365-406 A.D.) built maternal hospitals for the needs of the pregnant women. Those hospitals were named as ‘Paswantinama Sala’. That word means ‘the halls built for the delivery’. In the inscriptions those buildings were named as ‘Thimbirige’. From an ancient time, there was the tradition of building maternal hospitals in this country. There was a type of halls called ‘Sottisala’ during king Pandukabhaya’s reign. The annotative texts describe that the name ‘Sottisala’ was used by Brahmins for the places where religious activities were performed and to name the maternity hospitals.

The intelligent kings, who ruled our country maintained mutual relations with their neighbouring countries as well as with distant countries. The countries with which relations were maintained, changed from time to time. Relations were maintained with Asian countries including India and Araby since a very long time and with some European countries since several centuries from the recent past. Inscriptions in the South India mention that King Gajabahu I (114-136 A.D.), who was a reputed ruler from the ‘Lambhakarna’ lineage had arrived in ‘Chera’ state in South India to participate in a ceremony where a ‘Pattini’ Devala was declared open. Perhaps the purpose of this journey might have been to strengthen the mutuality of statesmanship between two countries.
Mahawamsa mentions that king Bhatikabhaya (23B.C-7A.D.) had sent ambassadors to ‘Romanuka Desha’. Here ‘Romanuka Desha’ means Rome. The purpose of this mission was to fetch glass pebbles for a Pooja performed at Ruwanweli Seya. In the 8th and 9th centuries A. D. the rulers of this country built a close relation with China. During that time ambassadors from this country went to China. In the ruling period of king Aggabodhi VI these relations were very strong. During that time twenty foreign missions went to China. The success in trading was the basic background of the relations built with China and it made a cultural influence too. Sri Lanka had marital relations with neighbouring countries. This reflects another way that Sri Lanka maintained its foreign relations. Specially, there is information in the Wamsakatha about marital relations that our rulers had with powerful Indian states such as Kalinga, and Pandya. King Vijayabahu I (1070-1110) married a Kalinga princess named Thilokasundari and the king’s sister princess Miththa married a Pandyan prince. It seems that the fundamental purpose of these marital relations was to maintain the political power with stability through relationships. Though there were differences in languages and religions, acting with trust with the neighbouring countries were one of the prominent features of the foreign policy of our rulers. The best example for this is that King Vijayabahu I appointed the Veleikkara army for defense of the Polonnaruwa Temple Tooth. Veleikkara force was a mercenary army which came from Southern India and served in Sri Lanka for payments. After the 10th century A.D., our kings had a mutual relationship with Arabian countries. The purpose of that must have been giving Sri Lankan contribution stably for the trade affairs done by the Arabian traders in the Indian Ocean. As it is mentioned by the Arabian historian Al – Balasuri, who lived in the 9th century A.D., the king of ‘Ruby Island’ (Sri Lanka was called by this name) had exchanged gifts with the Islamic king. If it is summarized, the main purposes of the ruling in this country were creating a peaceful co-existence among the countrymen, providing their welfare and protecting the territorial integrity for preserving the motherland and future longevity of the countrymen. In parallel to them, it seems that they have acted with a farsighted vision to work in a mutual understanding with the neighbouring countries. The majority of the people lived in villages. In comparison to the present condition, those villagers’ lives were shaped up in a very simple way. Most of their occupation was agriculture. Some were engaged in Chena cultivation whereas the others were engaged in paddy cultivation. They reared animals for living. Apart from these, some, who were engaged in different occupations, lived in villages completely separated for themselves.",

        "content": "Farming/ Agriculture The main livelihood of the villagers who lived in the ancient Sri Lanka was farming. Animal husbandry or rearing animals was also done in line with the agricultural activities. Agriculture was done in two ways; one was muddy agriculture alias paddy cultivation; second was Chena cultivation. The historical and archaeological sources substantiate that the Chena cultivation was the oldest out of these two. The term ‘Hena’ (Chena) used in ancient time has been mentioned as ‘Sehen’ in Buthsarana, the literary text, ‘Sen’ in Ummagga Jathaka, and ‘Pitibim’ in inscriptions. Chena Cultivation – ‘Hena’ or Chena cultivation is an inland cultivation. A suitable land for ‘Hena or Chena’ is prepared for growing grains and vegetables after choosing a plot of land from a jungle area, clearing it by cutting small, trees, undergrowth and thorny bushes in it and burning them after they dried. In this process the farmers would not cut big trees. Before setting fire to the cleared jungle area, the owner of the Chena shouts out in order to chase away animals from that area.

A new chena, which has been cleared by setting fire to it, is called as ‘Nawa Deli Hena’. Those Chenas are fertile. The term ‘Nawadeli Sena’ has been mentioned in ‘Saddharma Rathnawaliya’ too. In some parts of Sri Lanka, a different meaning is given to the term ‘Nawa Deli Hena’. It says the term ‘Nawa Deli Hena’ is used for Chenas where the nine plants namely, finger millet (Kurakkan), Kollu, Undu, green gram(Mun), Corn (Iringu), millet (Thanahal), dill seeds (Asamodagam) and Amu have sprouted in lush. The villagers in Anuradhapura use the term ‘Kanaththa’ to name the Chenas which are prepared to start cultivation again after giving it up for some time. The normal method practised in Chena cultivation was abandoning a certain Chena after cultivating it for once or twice. As it is abandoned for some time, it grows wild again. Therefore, old Chena cultivation did not do any harm to the environment.

The seeds such as Undu, Ma, Green gram (Mun), finger millet (Kurakkan), Corn (Iringu), Sesame thala, amu, mustard (Aba), dill (Duru), and millet (Thanahal) as well as vegetables such as Karabatu, Thiththabatu, Brinjal (Vambatu), ash pumkin (Alu puhul) and pumpkin (Wattakka) were cultivated in Chenas. Al vee (a type of paddy), yams, Uk Gas (sugar cane) and Kapu (cotton) were cultivated in Chenas separated for them. During that time the cultivation of sugar cane and cotton was rich enough to produce jaggery and clothes needed for the country. The Wamsakatha mention that there were labourers engaged in sugar cane industry. Our ancestors were able to produce jaggery needed within the country itself for a long time. The scholars point out that until the 16th century A.D., sugar was not imported to this country.

As a Chena is cultivated in a place which is away from farmers’ houses, they stay temporarily in a hut built in the Chena until it is harvested. The fence, which is normally made out of sticks around the Chena to protect its crops from the wild animals, is called ‘Dandu Weta’. The small hut built at the top of a tall tree in the Chena is called ‘Pela’. It was in this ‘Pela’ that the farmers stayed sleeplessly at night to protect the crops in their Chenas from wild animals.

During the times of some kings, taxes were charged for cultivating Chenas. Two types of such taxes, ‘Kethi Ada’, ‘Ketu Kanaba Aya’ have been mentioned in inscriptions. The inscriptions say that King Nissankamalla (1187-1196 A.D), who ruled in Polonnaruwa, abolished those two types of taxes.

Since there was not much population in ancient time, Chena cultivation was enough to meet the needs of their lives. Muddy or paddy cultivation was started in order to produce more food required for the increasing population.

Paddy Cultivation – In inscriptions the places where paddy was cultivated have been introduced as ‘Kumbura’ and ‘Ketha’. Sometimes the word ‘Kumbura’ may have been used to introduce the small space which was used for paddy cultivation. The term ‘Ketha’ has derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Kshesthra’. It meant 'considerably big fields'.

Mostly the paddy cultivation was done by using irrigation. During monsoon seasons, rain water was reserved in tanks. Then the water was carried to paddy fields through canals. Twice a year paddy was cultivated. The seasons in which paddy was cultivated were introduced in the name of ‘Kanna’. The two ‘Kannas’ (seasons) in which paddy was cultivated were called ‘Maha Kannaya’ and ‘Yala Kannaya’. Apart from these, another one introduced as ‘Meda Kannaya’ is found in inscriptions. It came between ‘Yala Kanna’ and ‘Maha Kanna’ and also depended on the abundance of water.

The main need of the dry zone to maintain paddy cultivation successfully was to supply sufficient water. Gathering rain water and taking water through canal to paddy fields by putting a barrier across the natural rivers were the two strategies followed. The tradition of making tanks developed in this country as a strategy to face the need of preserving water. The statement uttered by king Parakramabahu the Great (1153 – 1186 A.D.) as “Not a single drop of water that falls from the sky should be sent to the sea without properly using it” shows how the ruler saw the importance of preserving water.

Unlike at present, farmers in the past were conscious of doing various customs in the paddy cultivation. It provided them with much assistance to be engaged in their livelihoods by being close to the nature.

Animal Husbandry – Apart from agricultural activities, there was animal husbandry too. Rearing cattle was the major activity in it. The inscriptions mention Gopalagams, which were reserved for those who were engaged in cattle rearing. What was taken from cattle was very helpful for food. Mee kiri (milk or curd), Githel (ghee), Wendaru (butter), were prominent among them. There is a word “Kirigeri” in an inscription, made by king Kashyapa IV, in the Colombo Museum. What it means is the cattle reared for getting milk. A nice carving of a woman who gets milk from a cow has been engraved on the rock ‘Mahameru’, which was settled in the ancient Stupa of the temple named Nagapabba in Sigiriya. Apart from cattle, chicken and goats were reared in houses. There is an inscription, written in the 9th century A.D., at the hospital in Padhanagara at Ethvehera temple in Medirigiriya, Polonnaruwa. It is mentioned in the inscription that for needs of the patients only the flesh of naturally died chicken and goats should be used. You learned in previous lessons that from very ancient time the metal industry of Sri Lanka was highly developed. There is some information about artisans who worked in their industries using iron. Among them, blacksmiths were prominent. The name ‘Kabara’ was used to introduce them in inscriptions. That is how the word ‘Kammara’ was written in old Sinhala. The blacksmiths were very essential and important to the villagers. He was the one who made pruning knife (Keththa), mammoty (Udella), and plough (Nagula) for them. In an inscription in a place called Muthugalla in Polonnaruwa, there is a reference about a blacksmith named Majjima. Apart from this, there were artisans who were engaged in their industries using copper (Thabakara) and tin metal at that time. The word ‘Thuladhara’ had been used to introduce goldsmiths in ancient documents. In some of the books they have been described by the name of ‘Swarnakara’. An inscription found in the place called Mandagala in Hambantota district, there is a reference about a goldsmith named Thuladara Sumana. Things such as bead and badges, made of types of half gems and gems, found in old cities such as Anuradhapura and Magama from the archaeological excavations reflect the nature of the gem industry existed in the society of this county. The artisans who were engaged in such affairs were called ‘Manikara’. Another industry, which existed in the ancient society of this country, was the art of carving on tusks. An inscription situated close to Vegiriya Devalaya mentions a craftsman of tusks named ‘Datika Sumana’. The term ‘Datika’ comes from the word ‘Danthika’. Earthenware was the most useful ones for the ordinary people, who lived in those days, for their day-to-day activities. A large number of remnants of such earthenware have been discovered in archaeological excavations. Making earthenware was a well organized industry at that time. Even the inscriptions written more than 2250 years ago mention about those who were engaged in pottery. Then they were named ‘Kumbhakara’ (Kubakara). In an inscription in a place named ‘Veherakema’ in Hambanthota district a word named ‘Thathvaya’ appears. This term is a combination of the two words ‘Thanthu Vaya’. Its meaning is ‘one who spins strings’. Spinning strings is related to weaving clothes. Historical sources say that weaving clothes was an industry that existed in our country from ancient time. The reference of the spinners of strings mentioned in the Veherakema inscription is an obvious evidence that proves the cloth weaving industry existed at that time. By mentioning information about artisans who were engaged in different types of industries such as these occupations in our history, it appears that the ancient society of our country was well organized. All these artisans made a contribution out of their knowledge and labour to run the society well.",

        "title": "Trading In ancient time",
        "content": "Trading In ancient time there were only a few number of cities. According to sources, Anuradhapura and Magama were prominent among them. To call them the word ‘Pura’ has been used. The rich lived in big cities. There were both local and foreign traders in those cities. At the southern gate in Anuradhapura, there was a bazaar called ‘Kalasumana’.

Trade was a major occupation in our country during ancient time. Trade activities were maintained locally as well as with foreign countries. An inscription in the western water park of Sigiriya mentions about a person called ‘Abala Wapara’. That is the way how ‘sour business’ was written in old Sinhala language. It is a ‘tamarind trader’ that was introduced thus. That inscription had been written 2250 years ago. Except for a small group, others worked by organizing themselves collectively. That kind of organization was addressed by the name ‘Poogaya’. In some places the word ‘Niyamasthana’ has been used for that.

Those who were engaged in trade were called ‘Wanija’ or ‘Vapara’ in those days. The word ‘Vapara’ was the old Sinhala term of ‘Vyaparika – business’. These traders were the rich in the ancient society. They had even offered caves for Bhikkus to stay. An inscription in the place called ‘Mandagala’ in Hambanthota district mentions that a trader called ‘Sumana’ had offered such a cave. Another inscription was found in a place named ‘Weherakema’. That inscription includes a description about an offering of a cave to the Bhikkus by an organization of those who did their trading by weaving clothes.

There were markets for selling commodities in trade cities and villages. Literary sources mention that one Suranimala, who came to Anuradhapura from Mahagrama, bought perfumes at a shop. The information in the inscription of King Udaya IV (946-954 A.D.) points out the way how ancient markets were administered in an organized way.

The best example that can be given for this is the description given in the Soraborawewa inscription about Hopitigama market. It includes the laws imposed by the king on its administration. There is a law mentioned in it which commands that taxes should be charged only from the carts which come to the market, but not from the carts which go passing the market. A law has imposed stating that betel should only be sold keeping in a hut covered from the sun. It was done in order to prevent selling dried betel to people. There were no trading affairs on poya days then. A fine was charged from those who did their business on poya days. Those did trading on poya days at the Hopitigama market, had to supply oil to light lamps at the Mahiyanganaya temple as a fine.

The Tamil inscriptions, found in Sri Lanka, which belonged to the period from the 11th century to the 13th century A.D., mention that there were several South Indian trade organizations afoot in this country during the same time. Nanadesi, Valagngniyar, and Ayinurwur are some of them. A metal stamp, which belonged to the trade organization named Nanadesi, was discovered in Hambantota.

There is enough evidence to prove that there were a considerable number of foreign traders in this country in the early period. In an inscription in a place named Bowaththegala in Southern Province, there is a term “Kajoba Maha Pugiya”. It is about a big trade organization of the Cambodians. The Cambodians were traders who came here from Afganistan.

From ancient time our country played a significant role in international trade affairs. One reason that affected for this was Sri Lanka was located in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The contribution that Sri Lanka made as an exchanging center in the East-West trading in the ancient time cannot be belittled.

One of the specific factors that contributed Anuradhapura to develop as a city was international trading. In the West Mathota harbour was located where as Gokkannathiththa, known as Trincomalee harbour today, was situated in the East. Apart from these, the actions of small harbours situated on the western and eastern coasts made a direct influence on the emerging urbanization of Anuradhapura. Bringing Sri Maha Bodhi from the small harbour named Jambakolapattana situated in the Northern coast and bringing the Tooth Relic from the small anchorage port called Lankapattana situated in the Eastern coast by prince Dantha and princess Hemamala to this country are examples for this.

 Teachers Teaching profession too was another occupation existed in ancient Sri Lanka. In ancient documents the word ‘Acharya’ has been used to introduce teachers. Not only those who taught crafts, but also those who excelled in education, were named as ‘Acharya’. These Acharyas were good at different types of crafts. The inscriptions mention information about teachers who trained taming tuskers (Hasthi Acharya), going on horseback (Ashwa Acharya) and shooting with the bow (Dunu Acharya).

 Doctors To run a society well, the citizens who belong to it must be healthy. The service of the doctors is very important for that. In the Anuradhapura period medical profession held a high recognition. The word ‘Veja’ was used to introduce doctors in inscriptions. In the 9th century A.D. some doctors had been named as ‘Maha Vedana’. Such a term was used to name the chief doctor or surgeon.

 Lawyers (Legal Advisers /Experts) 2000 years ago there lived professionals who were conversant with law. It seems that mostly they gave the required instruction to the king to achieve justice. Such people who knew about law were called by the name of ‘Vohara’. It derives from the word ‘Wyavahara’ in Sanskrit language. This name was given to the persons who were proficient in the accepted practices of justice and goodness in the contemporary society.

 Different Artisans The persons, who were engaged in different types of industries and artistic occupations, lived in the society of this country during ancient time. The sources mention that there were dancers, painters and poets among these artists. In an inscription, found in an old temple in Medagama in Kurunegala district, inscribed 2200 years ago, there is a reference about a dancer named Tissa. Introduction of the wife of this dancer as a Parumaka is an important fact here. It gives us a clear idea that dancing had been considered as an important occupation in the society. The words ‘Chithakara’ and ‘Lapana’ were used to introduce the painters. The first name had derived from the word ‘Chithrakara’ and the second had derived from the word ‘Lepana’. In Sanskrit language the word ‘Lepana’ is used to give the meaning ‘applying’. Since applying colours create paints, the word ‘Lepana’ had been used to name the painters. In an inscription in the place named Nattukanda, there is a reference to a person called ‘Lapana Tissa’.

In our country there were highly talented poets. The word ‘Kavi’ itself had been used to name them. The son of above mentioned Lapana Tissa had been introduced as a poet in the same inscription. His name was Sanjaya.",

        "content": "Religion From the time when Arahath Mahinda Thero arrived here in the 3rd century B.C and preached Buddhism, it had continually been the main religion of this country. Apart from this, with the arrival of Indian traders and others from India, Hindu religion too spread in this country. Christian religion and Islamic religion were introduced to Sri Lanka at recent times when it is compared to the spread of Buddhism. It was as a result of spread of trade in the Mediterranean region after the 6th century A.D. and in Western countries centered trade after the 16th century A.D. in Eastern countries.

Soon after the arrival of Arahath Mahinda Thero and his followers, Buddhism and the rituals related to it spread rapidly in the society of this country. As there were no suitable monasteries for the daily increasing number of Bhikkus to stay, natural caves were cleaned and offered them to Bhikkus. More than 1600 caves offered in such a way to Bhikkus can be seen in different parts of the country.

A suitable cave was found, cleaned, made a drip ledge in order to prevent water from coming inside during the rainy season and offered them to Bhikkus. In some caves the details of those who offered them have been engraved under the drip ledge on the rock. Those days Brahmi letters were used for that. Those inscriptions have been written in old Sinhala language named ‘Sinhala Prakrutha’. You, who participate in school educational trips, will have the opportunity to visit such caves, in which drip ledges and inscriptions are engraved, in places such as Mihintale, Ritigala, Vessagiriya and Sigiriya. Given below here is an inscription in a cave in Mihintale.

Inscription- Parumaka Gutha Putha Parumaka Sumanaha Lene Agatha Anagatha Chathudisha Sagasa.

Meaning- This cave was offered to the Sanga (the Bhikkus), both who are present and not present from the four directions, by Chief Sumana, a son of chief Guptha.

Apart from caves and temples, sources mention about certain buildings introduced in the name of ‘Pannasala’. That means houses made of clay and wattle and thatched with reeds and leaves. The Bhikkus stayed in such places, before temples and monasteries were built with bricks and granite. The word ‘Pansala’ we use today has derived from the term ‘Pannasala’.

Several Bhikkus lived in ancient Buddhist monasteries. The Bhikkus who lived under the chief monk were called “Anthewasika Bhikkus- disciples monks”. An inscription engraved in a cave in Mahaelagamuwa in Anuradhapura mentions about a person who was called ‘Athewasika Pussa’. During those days the chief monks were addressed in the name of ‘Thera’. In inscriptions the student monks who lived in association with those chief monks have been named as ‘Sadivihariya’ or ‘Saddi Viharika’. The meaning of that term is ‘one who lives close by’.

Until the Thripitaka (three scriptures) was documented during the ruling time of king Valagamba, Dhamma had been preserved by oral tradition. There were monks who had kept a part of the Thripitaka in their memory. They were named as ‘Bhanakavaru’. The monks, who had memorized the scriptures that belong to the doctrine, were called by the name of the particular scripture. For example the monks who had memorized the Deega Nikaya were called Deega Bhanaka and those who had memo",

        "content": "There is evidence that Brahmin groups lived in and around Anuradhapura city during the time when Buddhism was rooted in the society of this country. They were Hindu devotees. Mahawamsatika, which described that there was a type of buildings, mentioned in Mahawamsa, in the name of Sottisala, points out that the places where the Brahmins performed their religious activities too were called by that name. And also, that book, which describes the word ‘Sivikasala’, points out that it meant the places where the ‘Shiva Lingas’ (phallus of god Siva) were established. Those ‘Pooja’ performed for the God Siva is well-known among the Hindu devotees. As South India is located close to Sri Lanka and there prevailed regular trade relations between the two countries, ideas of the Hindu religion were brought here. The oldest inscriptions of this country mention about the Tamil traders who came to Sri Lanka for trading. They have been introduced as ‘Dameda’ in those inscriptions. That is how the term ‘Dravida’ was written in Sinhala Prakrit language. By the 7th century A.D.

There lived a considerable number of Tamil people close to the main harbours of this country. Thirukethishwaram Hindu temple built close to the harbour of Mathota and Koneshvaram temple built nearby the old harbour Gokannatitta, which was in Trincomalee were places worshipped by the Tamil people who lived there during that time.

An old stone plate, with a cross engraved on it, has been discovered in Anuradhapura. That cross belongs to a catholic sect named Nestorians. Later the traders who held the ideas of the Nestorian sect, which developed centred on Persia, migrated to Sri Lanka through the trade routes. The traveller Cosmos Indicopletus, who belonged to the 5th century A.D. has mentioned about a group of Persian traders who lived in Anuradhapura. The scholars are of the view that the stone post with the Nestorian cross found in Anuradhapura was made after the arrival of the Portuguese to this country.

There are evidences that the ideas belonging to Islam religion prevailed in Sri Lanka in the period after the 9th century A.D. In the ‘Quitab –Al- Musliqval – Mamalik’, the oldest Arabic geographical book discovered so far, has mentioned Sri Lanka as ‘Sarandib’. ‘Sarandib’ was the way that the Arabs pronounced the term ‘Sinhaladweepa’. This book was written in or around 845 A.D. There was a mutual relation between Sri Lanka and Arab from ancient time. It was a relation which went beyond mere trade relations. The book ‘Ajayib Al- Hind’, written by a person called Iban Shahriar in 953 A.D. mentions that when Prophet Mohammed, the leader of Islamic religion, was alive, a group of people from Sarandib had arrived in Arab to get a clear idea of his doctrine. The Muslim commercial domination, started by the Abbaseede centred on Bhagdad, spread in Asia between 751 – 1258 A.D. The Arabic historian Al – Bhalasuri who lived in the 9th century A.D., has mentioned that the Sri Lankan rulers had taken proper measures to manage the international trade affairs well.",

At the early stages knowledge was passed from generation to generation through exercise and listening to someone. When we study the similarities of the styles and finishing of the clay pots containing burnt human remains and the clay tub burials built in several places since 4400 year ago, it is very obvious that the knowledge on the technology that was needed to make those things had been gathered in an organized manner.

As it was mentioned early in this lesson, the group which is named as ‘Achariya’ in the oldest inscriptions in our country is teachers. The things taught by those teachers were mentioned in the places where they had been introduced. They have been introduced as “Dhanu Achariya”, “Hathi Achariya”, and “Asa Achariya”. They were the teachers who taught archery, the art of controlling tuskers, and the art of controlling horses respectively.

After Buddhism was rooted in this country, Buddhist temples and monasteries became the main educational centres. The scholarly monks who stayed in them were fully conversant not only with the languages such as Sinhala, Pali, Sanskrit, and Prakrit, but also with the Buddhist doctrine. From ancient time they were the teachers in this country.

There was a sense of respect regarding giving education and receiving education in our ancient society. The poem mentioned in the Lokopakaraya is a fine example for that. It is given below.

Ru Siri Yowun Guna – Nena Siyallen Noadu Vee muth Nodathoth Silpa Satha – Suvanda Nethi Kele Mala Sama We

Nearly 600 poems composed during the Anuradhapura period could be seen even today on the mirror wall in Sigiriya. The sense of inspiration of those poems is very high.

The poets of our country in the ancient time, who were disciplined with Buddhist teachings, composed poems based on the experience gained from working with the nature constantly. Hence, the theme of most of the poems was impermanence. Such an attractive poem has been written in an inscription, which belonged to the 9th century A.D, found in the premises of Abhayagiri temple. The techniques such as similes used in that poem create a very sensitive and subtle aesthetic sense in the reader. The poem says that life is like a ‘Vara’ flower caught in a wildfire.

You will be able to understand easily the nature of aesthetic thoughts of the ancient Sri Lankans by reading, understanding and appreciating the Sigiri graffiti given below.

As our ancestors were engaged in farming and animal husbandry from a long period of time they were able to live closely with the nature. Therefore, they had a simple but deep understanding about the beauty and the uncertainity of the nature. As those ideas were further developed by the teachings of Buddhism, a dispassionate taste was developed in the ancient society.",

        "content": "Ethnic Co-existence There are evidences to prove that there lived people, who belonged to different cultures in the cities of our country from the ancient time. The inscriptions point out that apart from the native Sinhala people, there were groups of people, belonging to other cultures and beliefs in other religions, who came here for trading, among the urban community. Among them there were traders who came from South India, the Ionians who came from the Greek and Macedonian regions, the Cambodians who came from the Afganistan region, and the Jawakans who came from the Malayan peninsula.

Though there was much diversity among the aforementioned nationals, they had never tried to fight with each other. An inscription found in Abhayagiri Vihara in Anuradhapura mentions about a Tamil monk. It was written around 1st century A.D. The ancient people of this country did not use to look at other nationals with suspicion. Instead, they worked and lived with them amicably. An ancient inscription found in Ampara mentions about a Tamil man who was married to a Sinhalese woman. The archaeologists were able to discover a street in Anuradhapura where several Tamil families had lived.

The merchants, who migrated from various countries in the region around the Indian Ocean, lived in ancient cities in Sri Lanka. However, it seems that most of them had come from South India. There was a special post in the king’s court named as ‘Demala Adhikari’ by the 9th century A.D. His task must have been to look into the matters regarding the welfare of the Tamil people who lived in and around Anuradhapura. A person named ''Demel Adhikari Pandiradh'' has been mentioned in an inscription of king Kashyapa IV which is in the National Museum of Colombo. Among this Tamil community, most of them were soldiers who served as the mercenary soldiers in the army in our country. The oldest kings who sought the assistance of the South Indian mercenary soldiers were king Ilanaga (33 -43 A.D) and King Abhayanaga (231 – 240 A.D.) They, who came from Kerala, were called ‘Agampadi Senawa’. The Wamsakatha say that King Vijayabahu I had assigned the duty of providing defence to the Dalada Maligawa (Temple of Tooth) to Welayikkar force. The Welayikkaras were the group of Agampadi who came here from Kerala.

In the 11th and 12th centuries A.D. a group of merchants named ‘Nanadesin’ who were engaged in trade affairs in this country were a company who had a South Indian origin. A bronze cachet which belonged to them has been discovered in Hambanthota. An inscription, written during the reign of queen Lilawathi, found in Anuradhapura, mentions about a customs barrier which had belonged to the group of merchants called ‘Nanadesin’. According to the historical records, these merchants had been engaged in their activities peacefully and the rulers too had provided much assistance for their welfare and protection.

Our citizens used to work amicably not only with the Tamils, but also with the Arabs who were Muslims. The Sri Pada (Adam’s Peak) mountain, which was consecrated with the touch of the foot of the Lord Buddha, is a sacred epitome of the Buddhists of this country. From the 9th century it was worshipped by the Muslims based on the belief that it is the Adam’s Peak. It has been recorded that in 850 A.D. a merchant and a traveller called ‘Sulaiman’ had arrived to worship Sri Pada. None of them were disturbed by the government or the citizens. Therefore, Sri Pada is venerated by all four religions.

In the ancient time, the rulers and the citizens of this country often thought how they could work with all with co-existence for the betterment of the country. Every occasion when the protection of the stability of Buddhism and the unity of the country were not threatened, that co-existence was well preserved. We should always remember that the way the Sinhala Buddhist people, who lived in this country, acted to tolerate other nationals and religions is exemplary.",

When some of such activities are examined carefully, it is clear that some of such things had been done thinking scientifically. When working with nature, being knowledgeable on its fundamentals is necessary.

The success of the activities from making a tomb to constructing huge irrigation systems depends on understanding fundamentals of nature correctly, which is needed to keep them for a long time. In this chapter we will discuss the scientific ideas that existed in Sri Lanka and the nature of the technical approaches which were followed to put those scientific ideas into practice.

We have seen that when something is thrown up, it falls down. It is a characteristic of nature. There is a fundamental which affects that characteristic. Scientists introduce it as gravitation. Scientists have proved through experiments that everything is attracted in a certain space limit on earth. If someone wants to find its truth, he or she can experiment and substantiate it. That is the nature of science.

The normal order which is followed in doing something scientifically is understanding the fundamentals in nature correctly and substantiating them by examining. After examining what needs to work practically, using the fundamentals of nature, is technology. It is a fundamental in physics that the different types of energies in nature cannot be destroyed, but they can be transformed to other energies. Accordingly, transforming electric power into kinetic power and making an electric fan is a technical substitute.

Some of the instances which reflect how the ancient Sri Lankans had acted to apply the fundamentals of nature after having understood them, belonged to the prehistoric era. 28,000 years ago symmetrical stone tools were made up of alabaster named ‘ground-glass’. Those symmetrical stone tools reflect the then-prevailed organized technology to shape up those hard stones. This technology, with which tools are made after removing stone splinters by using much power, is called pressure slating.

The early stages of applied science were reflected in the prehistoric age and it became matured in the proto-historic age that came next. Given below are some instances which describe the nature of the scientific ideas that prevailed during that age.",

        "content": "lay tub burials were made to cremate the dead people. They were made up in the shape of a huge basin or a boat using raw clay. After selecting the appropriate clay type, the walls of the tomb were built with a minimum height and a suitable thickness. They had thought of keeping the balance of the walls of the tomb by building them perpendicular to the ground. Not only in the tomb, but also the walls of the house found in Udaranchamadama have been built perpendicularly.

It’s a fundamental of physics that when any object is perpendicular to earth in that manner, the pressure of those objects created on earth is neutralized. Those who built them had thought to minimize the harm to the walls by building them so. You may have seen that even today the masons use a plummet in building walls.

Though the burials made up of raw clay were not dried and burnt, when the skeleton was cremated, it had burnt well.

When the skeletons in a tomb, which belonged to 1350 B.C., were cremated, a clay tube had been fixed in order to get air inside it. It was in a recent time about the 18th century that the modern science propositioned that oxygen is essential for the process of burning. But the people of this country had understood that fundamental three thousand and two hundred fifty years ago. (More information about this has been explained in the lesson ‘Settlements’.)",

Clear evidences of building houses in Sri Lanka could be found in the proto-historic era. Archaeologists managed to discover ruins of such a house built in 1129 B.C. That house is in the village called Udaranchamadama in Rathnapura district. Its floor has been made up of reinforcing it by strewing strong pieces of stone and applying clay on it. Its wall had been made of clay and wattle. This was revealed by discovering some burnt pieces of the wall. There was a wall in the middle of the house to separate it as the front part and the rear part of the house. The holes of its wooden doorframe were found in excavations.

        "title": "Making Earthenware (Clay Pots)",
        "content": "Our country practised the technology of making earthenware (pottery) from ancient time. Clear evidence in this regard can be seen in the proto-historic era. During those days a simple machine called ‘Sakaporuwa’ (potter’s wheel) was used to make clay pots. ‘Sakaporuwa’ is a round board which can be rotated. If the earthenware needs to be made with a good finishing, the clay should be seasoned and prepared well. It needs a good knowledge of several steps such as finding the suitable type of clay, seasoning them, making a stove to burn them and burning the raw earthenware at an appropriate temperature.

Some clay pots which belonged to the proto-historic era had been found. Their interior is in black colour and the exterior is in red colour. The term ‘Kaalaraktha Varna Meti Bandun’ (black-red colour clay pots) is used to name them. Before the clay pot is burnt, it is filled with chaff and kept upside down in the stove. Afterwards, when it is burnt in the stove, it gets red colour outside and black inside. Inside of it turns dark because it does not get enough oxygen to be burnt since it is filled with chaff. This technology of burning clay pots disappeared after 300 B.C.

In addition, there was the technology of polishing and colouring the outside of the clay pot after it was burnt. The best example for this is the coloured clay pot discovered in the ancient house in Udaranchamadama. It had a white background with lines painted in orange colour. The natural red colour brown stones had been used to colour them. Before this clay pot was made, clay was dissolved in water and kept until the tiny particles were deposited. Next, very clean clay particles, as alluvial was used to make this clay pot. This method is very similar to the one used at present day to make porcelain ware. Since our people used earthenware abundantly in ancient time, the technology which was needed to make them in a standard way advanced from the proto-historic era.",

        "title": "Water Management",
        "content": "Since the oldest settlements in our country had distributed in the dry zone, the major challenge that those people had to face was collecting sufficient water for agricultural activities and their day-to-day needs. The need of constructing tanks, ponds and canals arose on this ground. The term ‘water management’ is the most suitable one to name any strategy used to gather water. We can understand the nature of the marvellous knowledge of our scientists and engineers who lived in the ancient time by looking at activities that they have done for water management.

Constructing large tanks – One of the great activities in our historical age was making large tanks. These large tanks were built based on multiple-facts such as making agricultural activities successful, controlling floods, and meeting the needs of the urban people. Constructing large scale tanks is a technical attempt with a very complex scientific knowledge. Some names of the large scale tanks constructed during the Anuradhapura era have been given below. After understanding their magnitude, you will easily realize the fact that how much of scientific knowledge is needed to construct and maintain such tanks after they are filled with water. Major factors that should be paid attention in constructing such large scale tanks are keeping the gathered water for a long time by controlling the pressure caused by its colossal capacity of gathered water and controlling the power caused by its extremely destructive pressure when the water is taken out for use.

Tank bund – It is essential to construct the tank bund strongly if it needs to hold a huge water capacity in it. When such a thing is practically done, what is important is taking steps needed to prevent the tank bund from sinking when it is constructed. What our ancient engineers had followed for this is that constructing the tank bund on a naturally established rock. After finding such a rock located between two natural hills, the tank bund was built connecting the hills from either side. As the tank bund is connected to two natural hills, it provided some assistance to the strength of the tank bund. The bund of the ‘Yodha Wewa’ is about seven miles in length and its height is 44 feet. You can understand how strong an artificially built soil bund should be, if it is to hold the pressure caused by its magnitude of water after the tank is filled.

The robustness is essential if the stability of the tank bund needs to be protected. To maintain this situation a systematic methodology has been applied when the tank bund was built. To understand this technology the archaeologists examined the tank bund of Sigiri Mahawewa tank by excavating it. What was seen here was that the tank bund had been constructed of several soil layers. It had been made of several thoroughly beaten layers such as, a layer of clay, soil, gravel and clay (Kirimeti) layer, kept one on one. Even today you may have seen soil layers being beaten in constructing roads to prevent them from sinking. Though today we have machines to do those things, in ancient time animals may have been used to do so. The historical sources say that elephants were used to beat soil layers in constructing the foundation of the Ruwanweli Seya.

Ralapanawa – When a tank is filled with water, waves occur on its surface. It happens so because of the wind and motion of the water. The structure that is built to prevent the harm of eroding the tank bund due to the power caused by water waves is known as Ralapanawa. The Ralapanawa is made by keeping stones on the interior slope of the tank bund. Realizing the power caused by water waves and using a method to prevent it was a result of the scientific thought of our ancestors.

Sluice – Releasing water from tanks in which magnitude of water contains, is a task that should be done carefully. In parallel to the distribution of water filled area in a tank, the height of its bund, which is holding water, also increases. Then, the height of the water level also increases. An extreme pressure is created due to the height of water. When releasing water out of such a place, one has to be highly careful because there is a possibility of turning it to be disastrous every time.

It seems that the engineers who lived in our country in the ancient time had thought of this well. The structure that they built to take water out of the large scale tanks is known as ‘Sorowwa’ (sluice). The sluice was built at a specific level on the tank bund using huge pieces of stones. In the Wessagiriya inscription made by king Mahinda IV, the two words ‘Mohol Naga’ could be seen. It says that ‘having set the stick which controls the water in the sluice’. The sluice was built using pieces of stones in a way in which it began from the area where water is filled in the tank bund and going under the tank bund or piercing it. A slab of stone, connected to the sluice vertically, was used to release water. Water was released by moving it. These slabs were known as ‘Diyaketa Pahana’. In the Wessagiri inscription there is a reference as “Sathar Riyanak Diyat Hindavu Diya Keta Pahan’’. It means that a stone slab, which was connected to a sluice to control water, was of a four Riyans (a unit of measurement) in height.

Bisokotuwa (sluice gate) - Bisokotuwa (sluice gate) is also a one part of the sluice. It means the rectangular space made of stones, from which water flows out from the tank. When it is looked from above, it looks like a square. There are more than one sluice made in tanks with a high bund. Its purpose is to take water out with least pressure level after releasing water at different pressure levels. The mud sluice is at the bottom level of a tank bund. This structure called the mud sluice was used to remove alluvial collected after a rainy season.

To build a sluice and to utilize it, a scientific knowledge is essential. Specially, what related to it is the understanding of the behaviour of the water well. That characteristic is known as the ‘clearness of water’. That is why it is important to learn about sluices under the title of ‘the ancient science of our country’.

Canals – Making anicuts across rivers, gathering water and taking the gathered water to tanks was a technicality, related to water management, which prevailed in our country from ancient time. There is a reference about an officer named ‘Adika’ in an inscription which belongs to the 2nd century B.C. He was a one who engaged himself in constructing canals.

Constructing Elahera Ela barricading the Amban River, which was a tributary of the Mahaweli River, was a huge canal built in ancient time. Water was carried through this to the tanks such as Minneriya, Giritale, Kawudulla and Kantale. There was another canal built barricading the Mahaveli River in Minipe area to carry water up to Polonnaruwa.

Another section related to the water management in our country in ancient time was the ponds dug and made for the use of monks who stayed in temples and monasteries. Kuttam Pokuna, Kumara Pokuna, Eth Pokuna and Nelum Pokuna were examples for this.

There used to be a technology in our country from ancient time to keep the standard and coolness of water in personal using. Specially, there is brackish water in the dry zones such as Anuradhapura. Therefore, it is natural for someone to invent techniques to protect the due standard of water. A major procedure is that they followed a systematic method in digging wells for drinking water. Large sized clay pots were put into the well and covered the walls of the well with them. These wells are known as ‘Uraketa Lin’. Such ‘Uraketa Lin’ (wells) have been discovered in several places in the dry zone.

Water Fountains in Sigiriya -The fountains which can be seen in the Western park of Sigiriya are one of the greatest creations. Four fountains have been created on either side of the entrance-avenues that stretch across the Western water park, towards the Sigiriya rock. The reason for creating four fountains was the need of making a certain change in the water-stream level which goes up out of them. The method in which these fountains have been made is simple as well as efficient. The basic theory followed there is lifting water abruptly, which pours down from an approximate height of 600 feet through a system of gutters to the flat land, by using pressure. By fixing a splinter of stone with round shaped holes in the place where the pressure is created, the water is thrown up in a beautiful way. The method that has been used to change the height of the water stream due to the water pressure generated naturally is to change the diameter of the holes in the stone splinter, which has been fixed to the place where pressure is created. The water stream goes up more due to the high pressure created by the hole with a small diameter and the water stream goes up only a little as comparatively a lesser pressure is given by the hole with a bigger diameter. The system of gutters in the Sigiriya water park have been made spirally in a way which makes water flow for a long distance in a low slope by allowing the alluvial, which mixes with water when water flows down from the top of the Sigiriya rock, to sink down with the help of natural gravitation power. Stone splinters have been kept in several places in the gutters to remove the alluvial which gathers in the rainy season. When heavy rains fall in Sigiriya, one can see water fountains work automatically even today.",

        "content": "Many details of the ancient architecture are found when the ruins in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa kingdoms are examined. That displays to us how different artisans in the ancient time had made great architectural creations. You will study some of the best architectural creations here.

Architecture – Many architectural creations such as Buddhist constructions, Stupas, Bodhigharas, Pilimageval, shrines, monasteries, alms halls, meditating cells, palaces, fortresses, and hospitals found from Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa eras could be seen.

Those evidences show us that there were buildings from the ancient time in this country. Very advanced scientific knowledge and a training on technology would need to put that scientific knowledge into practice in constructing the buildings found in Anuradhapura such as Jethvanaramaya, Abhayagiriya, Ruwanweli Seya, and several storeyed Lovamahapaya. For example Ruwanweli Seya and the other Stupas, built in Anuradhapura in the North Central dry zone in Sri Lanka which gets heavy monsoon rains, may be vulnerable to lightning strikes at any time. But, there are neither historical nor archaeological evidences to prove that they were struck by lightning. The reason for this is that the ancient engineers had acted to provide the scientific application to those buildings to protect them from such accidents. It is taught in physics that lightning occurs when static electricity passes between clouds containing two contradictory electric charges. Such extremely powerful current comes to the earth through a tall object with electric conduction. When the electricity passes in that manner, the object is destroyed by burning. You will learn more details of this process in your science lesson.

At present even some houses have lightning conductor to get protection from lightning. When Ruwanweli Seya was built, the engineers, who built it, did not forget to fix a lightning conductor. In historical sources that tool is introduced in the name of ‘Vajra chumbata’. ‘Vajra’ is the lightning which is an electric current generated naturally. The word ‘Chumbata’ has derived from the word ‘chumbaka’ (magnetic). Its meaning is ‘Kandama’. In Sinhalese language ‘Kandama’ means ‘attract’ or ‘cling’. Therefore, using the word ‘Vajra chumbata’ to name the structure made at the top of Ruwanweli Seya to attract lightning is appropriate. The electricity created by lightning is known as ‘static electricity’. It is taught in physics.

The Foundation of Ruwanweli Seya

Ruwanweli Seya was constructed by king Dutugemunu. It was the biggest Stupa constructed by that time. An adequately long description on an ancient construction has only been written about Ruwanweli Seya. Specially, a vivid and a descriptive explanation has been given in the historical sources about how the foundation of this great Stupa was made. According to it, first the earth of the place, where the Stupa was due to be built, had been dug in seven Riyanas (cubits) deep. Secondly, using strong men lime stones were brought, put them into the pit, broken them into pieces, poured water and trampled them well using tuskers wearing shoes made of animal skin. Thirdly, a type of clay named Wendaru was laid among those stones to reinforce them. Fourthly, another layer of stones and a layer of gravel were laid on it respectively. A layer of crystal was laid on the gravel layer. A type of clay named 'Navaneetha’ was smeared on that stone layer. Next, an iron net smeared with wood apple gum dissolved with a chemical fluid was laid upon it. Finally, the stones named ‘Ransiriyal’ soaked with sesame oil were laid upon it.

When we pay our attention to this description, we can understand that the foundation of Ruwanweli Seya has been made according to a similar method of the modern concrete technology. Such kind of strong base has been laid because it is a must that the heaviness of the mammoth stupa made of bricks is sustained for a long time without any damage. This example clearly reflects the way that our engineers thought and acted in making a huge construction and the scientific thought relevant to it two thousand and two hundred years ago.

Urban Park Designing

There was an advanced knowledge of constructing buildings and designing parks in our ancient society. The best example that can be given for this is the city plan of Sigiriya and its park complex. Sigiriya is a great city centre which was built in the 5th century A.D. It has been built centreing a huge rock which stands alone. The Sigiriya rock is 200 metres in height from its surrounding valley. The extent of the top of the rock, on which ruins of a palace could be seen, is approximately three hectares. The eastern and western royal accesses located focusing on the rock are of 40 hectares and 90 hectares respectively. The brick walls which have been constructed around the city complex for its security is approximately 10 kilometres. Apart from this, the entire length of the moats made around the Sigiriya rock is 8 kilometres. All of these things have been built according to a properly planned mathematical structure.",

Sri Lanka has a considerable history of medicine. Mahawamsa mentions the maternity houses (Sivikasala) which had been built in Anuradhapura during the ruling period of king Pandukabhaya. The Wamsakatha mention that king Dutugemunu had built eighteen hospitals. We earlier mentioned the details mentioned in the inscriptions about doctors who worked in those hospitals in this book.

Some ancient rulers of our country had mastered the medicine. Or else they extended their fullest support to widen the practice of medicine. In 1982 the archaeologists were able to find some significant evidences regarding this. They were found when the ancient land, called Alahana Pirivena situated in Polonnaruwa, with ruins, was excavated. In that place ruins of an ancient hospital emerged.

There was a hospital building of 147.5 feet in width and 109.2 feet in length. The instruments which were used for complex surgeries too were there among the things discovered from the place. Those relics show us that our ancient indigenous medicine was much advanced. Apart from this, information has been discovered on medicinal texts, herbal boats, allocating lands for indigenous doctors, growing herbal gardens.

We can understand that ancient people had acquired a good understanding about waste management from the remaining ruins of lavatories.

The lavatory systems used in the palaces were prepared to send the waste to a very deep pit. It seems that they had acted to emit the waste in a manner in which no any harm was done to the environment. A gutter for unclean water too has been discovered from the ruins in Polonnaruwa. Special tubes were fixed in bathing ponds to pump the polluted water out. Mahawamsa mentions that there were seven lavatories built in comparison to the buildings at the Alahana monastery (Pirivena). Accordingly, it is clear that in designing ancient buildings, the hygiene of their users had been paid much attention to.

The Ancient Iron Leaching Technology

From very ancient time our ancestors knew the iron leaching technology well. The archaeologists were able to discover a piece of iron-slag from a tomb dated in 2400 B.C. in Beragala in the Uva province. It is a piece of evidence which reflects that the iron was melted in those days.

There are two instances which assist us to understand the nature of iron leaching technology in Sri Lanka. The first one among them is the iron melting furnaces found in the Samanala Wewa area in Balangoda in the Sabaragamuwa province. The second one is the ancient iron furnaces discovered in the Alakolawewa, Dehigaha Elakanda area close to Sigiriya which belongs to the Central province. The natural stones abundant with iron have to be heated much to leach iron from them. Iron melts at 1538 degree Celsius. There should be an efficient technology to get an excessive-temperature. Iron leaching in Samanala Wewa has been done in third century B.C. The natural wind power has been used to inflame the furnaces used for melting. The furnaces built in a mountain face would flame for nearly about 12 hours without extinguishing with the help of the wind blowing between the hills. Even today during the monsoon time the wind, which blows across that area in the evening, continues until the dawn of next day. The natural stones with iron that were put into the furnaces after breaking them into pieces would be inflamed by placing cinders on them with the help of the natural wind power in the evening which would blow until the following dawn. By the following morning iron would be leached from the stones. The stones, which were used in Samanala Wewa to leach iron, are the types introduced in the terms ‘Limonite’ and ‘Hematite’ in chemistry. To inflame those furnaces, they had used the cinders taken by burning the trees called ‘Maran’. Even now these trees can be seen in this province. The term ‘Yakada Maran’ too is used to name these trees.

The wind power to inflame the furnaces in Dehigahaelakanda area has been provided with the help of bellows. From 180 B.C. to 200 A.D. iron leaching had been done there

Minor Industries – Apart from this, making various jewellery, clay industry, gem industry and forging industry were under minor industries.

The golden jewellery found in the excavations in Jethawanaya can be taken as the best example for the technology of making various jewellery. It is a part of a pendant as small as a paddy seed. There had been 21 flowery carvings on it. It may be a challenge to the modern goldsmith. And also, the coloured roof tiles discovered in Abhayagiriya excavations reflect the advancement of the ancient clay industry in this country.

In 2009 the archaeologists managed to find significant information about the Poojas performed for gods in the ancient time. They discovered some ruins of an ancient Devala in the excavations carried out in the area named Galpaya in Rathnapura district. Clay pots were kept upside down in a circle of about 6 feet diameter. There were marks of a fire of its inside space. There were a clay water pot and a jaw of an ox. The archaeologists were able to find holes of posts which belonged to a hut which had been built to cover everything. In later analysis, it was revealed that the place had been used to perform ‘Kirimadu Shantikarmaya’. It is performed for cattle’s protection. According to scientific dating, that Devala had belonged to third century A.D. Performing the ‘Kirimadu Shantikarmaya’ for the protection of cattle is done even today in the provinces of Uva and Sabaragamuwa.

Though Buddhism was famous among people, at the time, they tended to do other practices (Yathukarma) too. Performing Poojas for various provincial gods was prominent among them.

        "content": "Measure and Calculation - There was knowledge, in our ancient society, relevant to the fundamentals that existed in the nature by understanding them from such an old time. One indicator which shows that there exists scientific knowledge in a certain society is that there is a methodology to measure the physical situations which belong to the nature. Our ancient measurements can be introduced as examples for them.

Measuring the space - Our ancient people needed to measure the space when they used land for farming. Therefore, suitable measurements for that were prepared with the help of farming.

They used the measurements such as, Kiriya, Amuna, Karisaya, Pela. A field of one Karisa means a place where one Karisa of paddy can be sown. One Karisa is equal to four Amunas. One Amuna is equal to two acres field. Having a multiple link in measurements in this way is an advanced mathematical feature. The fact that should be taken into consideration here is that to measure the space the ancient people of this country had used units which are used to measure the volume. Look at the cycle given below.There is a description of a land which has a reference that one Karisa was offered to a Stupa built in that area, in an inscription, got written by king Bathikabhaya, found in a place called Dunumadalakanda in the Anuradhapura district. An inscription, which was established by King Kootatakannabhaya, found in the area named Horiwila in Anuradhapura, says that a plot of land of eight Karisa was offered to a temple named Tissa in that area.

There was a methodical system of measurements to measure the length in the ancient time. The smallest one of that was the atom. It was a small one. To measure short distances, there were measurements such as Angulaya and Viyatha. A Viyatha consists of 9 inches. Small measurements were essential in constructing buildings and making statues. The measurements like Gawwa, Yoduna and Usaba were used to measure long distances. King Nissankamalla ordered to erect posts to mark every distance of Gawwa. It is very similar to present day Kilometer posts. Those stone posts were named as Gawuthakanu. Two of such Gawuthakanu posts have been discovered in areas named Katugahagalge and Weligaththa in the Southern province. It seems that this measuring system had been used commonly in ancient eastern countries. Try to understand its mathematics by reading the cycle given below Measuring the weight

There were methodical units to measure the weight too. Specially, in trade affairs measuring the weight of some commodities was needed. According to the pillar inscription of Soraborawewa, it was prohibited to use weights, scales and measuring units which were not approved by the government. Try to understand the nature of the measuring system used in the ancient time by reading the cycle given below.We are well aware of the fact that we need digits to mark the measurements. Present day we use digits introduced by the Arabs. Therefore, they are called Arab numbers. But there was an old digit system in our country. The numbers ranged from one to ten can be seen in ancient inscriptions. The way they were written has been given in the chart 5.1

Measuring Time

Measuring time is very important for a society based on agriculture. Sowing seeds and reaping the harvest should be done according to the correct time. The sources provide us sufficient evidence to understand the methods used to measure time by our ancient people. The term ‘Varshaya’ was used to measure a long time period. It was based on a method of months according to the lunar cycle. Thirty days time, fifteen days from new-moon day to the full-moon day and another fifteen days from the full-moon day to new-moon day, was considered a month. These two parts were introduced as ‘Purapakshaya’ and ‘Awapakshaya’ respectively. The terms Duruthu, Navam, Medin, were used to name the months of thirty days time.

The eastern term ‘Vasa’ or ‘Havajara’ has been used to name a time period of twelve months in the inscriptions. The term ‘Vasa’ from the Sanskrit word ‘Varsha’ and the term ‘Havajara’ from the Sanskrit word ‘Sanvasthara’ were derived. The present term ‘Avurudu’ has derived from the ancient term ‘Havajara’ (Havajara > Havurudu > Avurudu). The term ‘Thithiya’ was used to mean a day. The word ‘Thatha’ has been mentioned in an inscription, established by king Abhaya, found in the place called Rajagala in present day Batticaloa district. It means ‘Thithiya’. A day is made of Muhurthas (moments). The term ‘Mohotha (moment)’ has derived from the term ‘Muhurtha’.

Scientific thoughts are needed in using measurements and numbers. We can understand that our ancestors had thought scientifically to understand the complex elements in the world. Several scientific experiences of Sri Lankans, who lived in the ancient time, have been explained in this lesson by means of such mathematical concepts.

Dedigama Elephant Lamp (Eth Pahana)

The place Punkagama, where king Parakramabahu I (1153 -1186 A.D) was born, is presently known as Dedigama. It is in Kegalle district. A stupa has been built in memory of his birth. It is known as Dedigama Suthighara Stupa. In 1951 this Stupa was excavated by the archaeologists. They were able to find a bronze lamp from the Stupa. This lamp consists of two human figures sitting on a tusker. The tusker is holding a sugar cane in its trunk. The special feature of this lamp is that it has been made to pour the oil into the abdomen of the tusker. It is the storehouse of oil. The oil trickles to the lamp through the genital organ of the tusker. When the oil level of the lamp dwindles by burning, spontaneously the oil stored inside the abdomen of the tusker trickles to the lamp. A scientific theory has been followed here. It belongs to the non-motile hydrology. Here, the oil regulation occurs automatically. Dedigama Suthighara bronze elephant oil lamp is an obvious example to substantiate the knowledge that the ancient Sri Lankan engineers had on fundamentals of complex physics",

The criteria which are necessary to organize one’s society, beliefs and criteria for practical steps which are necessary to formalize economic exchanges are some of them. Such knowledge structures produced by a historical society give experiences even to a present day society. That is known as the cultural heritage. This lesson has been compiled with a view of forming the basic foundation to create a citizen who has a historical consciousness by generating sensitivity in the student about six selected concepts that belong to the historical cultural heritage in Sri Lanka. These concepts comprise of the ancient social organization in Sri Lanka, law and tradition, finance and exchange, protecting the environment, representation of women, and local food.",

        "content": "Social organization means the nature of the relationships between the people and groups of that society which helps to maintain the sustainability of a particular society. It is a sociological concept. Anything becomes successful when it is organized. Society is no exception. When the social organization is unstable, its law, ethics and values get destroyed. As a result, that society becomes disharmonious. In the historical era, the intelligent and efficient rulers who ruled our country, constantly dedicated themselves to well organize the society of our country. Having an order in personal relationships is one of the major characteristics in a social organization. It is called hierarchy.

There is a social hierarchy in a society. If it is a hierarchy in which the power goes down from up, it is called a vertical hierarchy. The order such as king, ministers, government officers, arranged in top down order is a good example for that.

There are also structures with similar power in the society. In various institutions, the officers are equal. Such a structure is called a horizontal hierarchy. Ministers, army generals, treasurers are similar in power. Study chart 6.1 to understand the social organization which existed in ancient Sri Lanka.

The king is at the top of this social hierarchy. It was accepted that the king should be highly virtuous and an heir to the throne from the lineage. Therefore, the king was noble. We have described in the third chapter that the word ‘Nara Isera’ had been inscribed in an inscription, which belonged to king Kootakannatissa, in the Dambulla temple to show that the king was an “Eshwara” to the countrymen.

Those who worked close to the king were royal officers. The term “Radkol Samdaru” had been used to name such officers. Its meaning is “Raja Kula Swami Daru”. The term “Radala” had been derived from this word by the Kandyan kingdom. (RajaKula > Radkol > Radol >Radala).

The Buddhist clergy was at a top position in the social organization, as they advised the government. Sometimes they participated in the affairs of country ruling. The kings acted to hand over the authority to the Buddhist temples to collect taxes from the tanks in the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D.

The rich merchants, naval captains, doctors, and teachers were considered to be the chieftains of the society from ancient time. None of them participated in animal husbandry or farming.

The people of the country were below these chieftains. The inscriptions call them as “Kudeen”.

There were farmers, shepherds, potters, gem cutters, blacksmiths, fishermen and people engaged in other work were among them. The whole society depended on the food produced by the farmers.

The relationship between the general public in the country and the chieftains in top positions existed through mediators such as traders and government officers. The inscriptions mention about the government officers who travelled in the villages from time to time. On these journeys, the villagers had informed their problems to those officers who later informed those problems to the government officers of higher ranks and they informed them to the king.

Slaves were at the lowest level of the society. Their duty was to be engaged in various activities. They did not have the freedom, which was enjoyed by the others in the society. There were two types of slaves those days. One group of them were slaves from lineage. They were named as ‘Anwayathadasa’. There were mercenary slaves too those days. The term ‘Dhanankeethadasa’ was used to name them.

The king did the things which were needed to maintain better relationships and protect the welfare of each group in this social organization. Our intelligent kings had known that a society could be protected from disruption by protecting the bonds between each and every institution. At present the term social cohesion is used to describe this concept. Therefore, they always tried to rule the country righteously.",

        "title": "Law and Tradition",
        "content": "The common principles formed by a society are very important to run a society. Those common principles later become the law. The principles which are formed by a society are of two types. Some of them are systems of written laws. Other social acceptances are traditional.

The law and tradition control the anti-social behaviours of people for the benefit of the society. To protect the goodness of the society our intelligent rulers acted in accordance with law and tradition from ancient time.

Our kings acted with good understanding to make laws, implement those laws and to supervise those laws when they are used practically. In the 9th century A.D this country was ruled by a royal lineage which belonged to the dynasty called ‘Manawamma’. The inscriptions inscribed by those kings, mention about law institutions of that time. In those inscriptions the two words ‘Wadala’ and ‘Sabhawa’ are found. In legal activities officers from Wadala and Sabhawa engaged in them. Here the word ‘Wadala’ means the 'legislature', which is the parliament. In ancient time it was the king’s court.

In those inscriptions the word ‘Sabhawa’ means the ‘judiciary’. The laws imposed in a country are implemented by the judiciary. Other inscriptions corroborate that there was a methodical judicial system in our country in the ancient time.

The laws are monitored among the people by the security officers. They implement the powers of the executive. The term ‘Mekapper’ has been used in the inscriptions of the 9th century to introduce such officers. It had derived from the Tamil word ‘Mayikappar’. Its meaning is ''security officer''. The term ‘Dandanayaka’ too was used to name such officers. The Panakaduwa copper plate, which was made during the time of king Vijayabahu I, mentions that one ‘Dandanayaka’ named Sithnarubima Buddhanayake who had provided protection to king Vijayabahu I during the time when the king had adversities from enemies.

The evidence, which assists us to know about the nature of the laws that belonged to the most ancient history of our country, is rare. However, at least the ancient inscriptions help us to have a certain understanding of them. Among them the inscriptions of this country, which belonged to the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D., mention the laws regarding the irrigation, administration and charging taxes for using lands of the state. One sixth of the production had to be paid to the government as tax.

Dakapathi (Sanskrit: Udakaprapthi) – the tax paid for using tank water.

Bojakapathi (Sanskrit: Bhojakaprapthi) – the tax paid for cultivating the lands of the king.

Mataramajibaka (Sanskrit: Mathrikamathsyabaga) – the tax paid for catching fish in water courses.

At times the government charged commodities as taxes. An inscription, which belonged to the 9th century, mentions that one nut out of ten of the harvest should be paid to the government as tax.

Apart from agricultural activities, the tax law was relevant to several other sections. When the commodities were imported from foreign countries, custom fees were charged at the harbour. An inscription, which belonged to the 1st century A.D., found at an ancient Buddhist temple in Godawaya in the Hambanthota district, mentions that a custom fee charged by a fort which was situated close to the temple was offered to the temple.

There was a judicial system to administer punishments not only to those who violated the tax laws imposed in this manner but also to those who breached other laws imposed for securing the social justice. An inscription made by king Gajabahu I, in Situlpawwa, mentions about such a high court. The inscription describes that the fines charged by the Great Hall of Justice in the area (Mahavinichahi Labanaka Watithi) were offered to the monks in the Sithulpawwa temple by the king for their provisions.

Our intelligent kings constantly acted to protect the natural quality of the environment. Therefore, they were interested in imposing laws which were necessary to protect animals, vegetation, water and soil which belong to the natural environment.

The Kondawattawan inscription, which belonged to the 9th century A.D., mentions a law of charging a fine of five Kalan from those who did not plough their lands at the proper time. This law was imposed because when a land is ploughed in the rainy season, soil erosion occurs.

The rulers had imposed various types of laws in order to protect the policies regarding maintaining agricultural activities properly. A law regarding this could be seen in an inscription in Wessagiriya. It says that the grains, except Sihineti paddy, green gram (Mun) should not be sown in the paddy fields. This inscription belonged to king Mahinda IV.

Trading was one of the important professions in the ancient society. Our intelligent kings took steps to impose the laws which were necessary to run the trade inside the country properly. The Badulla inscription is a source which helps us to understand the nature of those laws that existed in the 9th century A.D. in this country. This is known as the Sorabora Wewa inscription. It was made by king Udya III (946 -954 A.D.). This inscription describes the laws which were imposed by the king preventing some frauds afoot in a government market situated in a place called Hopitigamuwa. The king stepped into the market while he was on his way to the Mahiyanganaya temple. Given below are some of the laws in the above mentioned inscription;

Taxes should be charged from those who are engaged in business in the Hopitigama trade area; taxes should not be charged from the passers-by.

Twice the amount of taxes should be charged from those who do their business without showing to the officers.

The unstandardized Madatiya weighing units should not be used in scaling goods in business.

Aricanuts and betel should only be sold by keeping them in the huts made for them.

An oil tax should be charged from those who were engaged in trading during poya days.

By examining the rules and regulations in the Sorabora Wewa inscription, we can understand the nature of the civil laws which were relevant to the internal trading of this country during the time in which the above mentioned inscription was made.

For the first time a law which said “no animal should be killed” was imposed by King Amandagamini Abhaya (19-29 A.D.). It was known as ‘Maghatha Law’. The Mihinthala inscription, made by King Mihindu IV (956 -972 A.D), mentions that a law was imposed to give the death sentence to those who kill buffalos, ox and cows, and goats. King Nissankamalla (1187 -1196 A.D) imposed a law stating that the birds living in reservoirs should not be killed.

Our kings were very strict regarding the criminal law. The Wewalkaetiya inscription, made by king Mihindu IV (956-972 A.D.), provides us with descriptions on this. It describes the punishments that should be given for the crimes such as stealing and murders. Death sentence by hanging is the punishment for murder. It further says that when cattle thieves are caught, the cattle should be given back to the owner and the seal on the skin of the cattle should be marked on the foreheads of the thieves with a heated iron. The responsibility of catching the hiding criminals were given to the villagers who lived in the same villages in which the criminals too lived. The villagers had to pay a tax to the government until they caught the hiding criminals. It was known as ‘Gruhadanda’.

Criminals were punished as an example to the people of the society to emphasize that they should not commit crimes. That was the foundation of our law. At present Roman –Dutch law is practised in Sri Lanka. It was introduced to our country a long time later.",

        "content": "Here, the exchange means the process of interchanging with an economic purpose. According to the information in the historical sources, the barter system was used in economic affairs in the most ancient era in this country.

The archaeologists believe that the circular shells made of clay, discovered from archaeological excavations, may have been used for exchange in economic affairs.

The usage of coins in this country was started in about 250 B.C. Those are a type of silver coins brought to this country by the merchants from the North India. The archaeologists name them as ‘Hasebu coins’. Various symbols were engraved on these coins which were round, square and rectangular shapes. Those coins were brought to this country by the merchants who arrived here from India.

These ‘Hasebu’ coins have been named as ‘Kahapana’ in the ancient inscriptions and ‘Kahawanu’ in literature. This term derived from the word ‘Karshapana’ in the Sanskrit language.

There is evidence that an independent coin was produced in this country either in the last half of the first century of B.C or in the first half of the first century of A.D. The coin on which the figures of an elephant and a Swastika were engraved, which had been discovered from archaeological excavations, is an example for this. Afterwards, many kings had issued coins during their ruling periods. There was a separate officer performing the duty of moulding coins. He was named as ‘Rupa Adyaksha (Picto-director). This name appears in the inscriptions, belonging to the 2nd century B.C., as ‘Rupadaka’. Above mentioned (Fig. 6.2) is a picture of a coin used in this country.

In the past, metal weight too was used as a value in exchange activities in this country. A piece of gold-metal was discovered in an excavation at the Abhayagiri temple in Anuradhapura. On it the words ‘Ran Devisi Kalanday’ have been engraved. Those letters belonged either to the 8th or 9th century A.D. ‘Kalanda’ is a unit used to measure weight. An inscription, discovered in Wessagiriya, which belonged to the 10th century A.D., mentions that king Kashyapa IV (898 -914 A.D.) had offered 200 Ran Kalan (Golden Pieces of Kalan) to Buddhist monks who stayed in a temple called Veerankura.

Coins, of which the origin is related to foreign countries, are found in various places in Sri Lanka. Among them what most abundant are Roman coins. Foreign coins were used in this country, considering the value according to their metal weight. Most of the Roman coins discovered by now have been made of copper. In ancient time, customs were charged in the harbours in our country. When the foreigners bring their commodities to this country, they paid taxes in the money of their country. On those occasions, the metal weight of the coins was considered. Apart from the Roman coins, Chinese coins, Arabic coins and British coins were used in Sri Lanka. The coins that we have seen with the English letters V.O.C belonged to the Dutch trade company called East India Trade Company.

This clearly shows how in the ancient time Sri Lanka practically applied the usage which was essential in economic affairs to be successful.",

        "content": "In the ancient time the Sri Lankan society thought about women with respect and treated them with high regard. The facts regarding that can be substantiated through literary sources as well as archaeological sources. Women were given the opportunity to rule the country. This reflects the respect and the trust that our ancient society had placed on women. An inscription, found near the old Stupa named Neelagiri situated at a place called Lahugala, mentions a great queen named Chula Seewali. Queen Leelawathi ruled the country three times.

When it is considered in common, the ancient women in this country were not oppressed with strict social bonds. There is no evidence in the literary sources which state that women had hindrances to do their activities freely. The Rasawahini, an old literary text, mentions a description of a woman who lived alone for three years until her husband returned from a foreign country where he did his trade affairs. Women were paid a special respect since the responsibility they held as mothers. The Rasawahini mentions, once, the Bhikkus said to Queen Vihara Maha Devi 'you possess wealth and a luxurious life because you had done meritorious deeds in your previous birth'. Vihara Maha Devi, in replying, said that there was no happiness or luxury in life without sons and daughters.

Being married was considered a social mission that should be fulfilled by women. A girl when reached sixteen years old was qualified to get married. The girls had to spend their time under protection of their parents until they were old enough to get married. The source named Sahassawathuppkaranaya mentions that it was the responsibility of the parents to make their daughters master cookery. Saddharmalankaraya describes that prince Saliya’s wife, Ashokamala won the hearts of everyone in the king’s palace by making delicious food. Dampiyaatuwagatapadaya says that the women who were clever at cookery were introduced by the special respected name as ‘Madhupachika’. At times the name ‘Madhurahaththarasa’ too was used. Its meaning is ‘having the ability of delicious cooking’.

Apart from the royal families, there was no impediment for women in the general society to possess leadership. In about the 2nd century B.C. there were leaders by the name of ‘Parumaka’ who were related to the provincial ruling of this country. An inscription, discovered at a place called Brahmanayagama in Anuradhapura district, mentions a woman called Parumakalu Samana. It says that she is the wife of the Parumaka named Nadika. Here, the name Parumakalu is the feminine noun of the word Parumaka. That inscription is a good piece of evidence to prove that women had also participated in the then provincial ruling. The names of female devotees, who played a major role in offering caves to Buddhist monks, have been inscribed in those caves. A rock inscription, found at the place called Kokebe in Anuradhapura district, which had belonged to the 2nd century A.D, mentions a name of a woman as Thalatha Lakshmi. It further mentions that she offered a half of her family property to a Buddhist temple during the time of king Bhathiytissa. The women who lived then had the freedom to support religion by spending their wealth.

Archaeological evidence discovered in archaeological excavations are necessary to substantiate the ideas such as these found in literary sources about the women who lived in the ancient Sri Lanka. A metal stick, which was used by a woman to colour her eye lashes in the distant history of 1129 B.C, was discovered in an old house at a place named Udaranchamadama in Rathnapura district. Not only that there were a few red and yellow brown stones scrubbed on something strongly and a clay bead. These brown stones were used to colour their skin. It reveals that women, who lived three thousand years ago spent their time to increase their beauty. Many factors related to women’s jewellery have been discovered in archaeological excavations. There is a grave, which belonged to the time period between 700 -450 B.C., in Ibbankatuwa close to Dambulla. An attractive necklace was discovered in excavating it. Some beads in that necklace have been imported from India.

The women, who lived in this country in ancient time, were respected as a sister and a mother by the society. There is no evidence to prove that she had lived a depressed life under one’s oppression or suppression. Since the ancient time our society respected the freedom of women.",

In the historical era paddy and Kurakkan were profusely used for food. Apart from these, Undu, green gram (Mun), sesame (Thala), marrow (Mae), Amu, Menari, Kongu, Waru, Yawa were also eaten. The historical books of Sri Lanka mention seven types of grain, which were used as food by ancient people. They are namely Sali, Veehi, Kedesa, Varaka, Kangu, Duma and Yawa.

The Thonigala inscription, made by king Keerthi Sri Meghavarnabhaya (301 -328 A.D.), mentions Paddy, Undu, Mun (green gram) and Thala (sesame). Saddharmarathnawaliya mentions that the meat of peacock cooked in ghee and El rice (El Hal) was one of the most favourite foods among the chieftains in Sri Lanka in the 12th century A.D.

Pala Maluwa and Kadi Embula with Niwudu rice was a most frequent meal of poor people in that time. Kady Embula is made of stale rice powder. Ancient Sri Lankans had a habit of drinking various types of gruels (Kenda). The words ‘Yagu’ or ‘Hambu’ had been used in old books, instead of the word ‘Kenda (gruel)’.

A food named ‘Athsunu’ made of fried grain powder had been mentioned in old books. ‘Thala (sesame)’ was eaten as a dessert. The Thonigala inscription mentions that one had offered ‘Thala (sesame)’ as a dessert to a Bhikku. Dampiyaatuwagatapadaya mentions a food named ‘Thila Sangulika’. This may be ‘Thala Guli’ (sweet balls made of sesame mixed with treacle or sugar with pieces of juggery).

In addition to different types of grain, various kinds of yams had a significant place among food in the ancient time. Old books mention kinds of yams such as Wel Ala, Kukulala, Katu Ala, Kondola, Bathala (sweet potato). The word ‘Sondala’ can be seen in Saddharmalankaraya. There were Wetakolu, Thampala, Weraniya Dalu, Kara Kola, Lunuwila Kola, Labu (pumpkin), Puhul (pumpkin), Karabatu, Kekiri (melon), Thibabatu, Nelambu Ala, Murunga (drumsticks), among the vegetables used then. There is a description in Saddharmarathnawaliya as “Labu, Puhul, Sondala, Wetakolu, aadi wu siyaluma liya jathihu katu ethi rukaya”.

Apart from the three methods of cooking Bedum (frying), Mellum (cook in a half way, specially kinds of leaves cut into small pieces) and Hodda (gravy), vegetables were cooked in three ways. Those are Anama, Embula, and Niyambalawa. Curries, cooked without gravy and can be eaten taking by hand, is called Niyambalawa.

Various types of spices (Kulu Badu) were used to make curries tasty in Sri Lanka in ancient time. They were called ‘Katuka Bhanda’. Present day women use the word ‘Thuna Paha (curry powder)’ instead of ‘Kulu Badu (spices)’ commonly. That word means three special types and another five types. The first three types mentioned are Lunu (salt), Duru (dill) and Miris (chilly). The other five are Sudu Duru (dill), Kalu Duru (dill), Koththamalli (coriander), Aba (mustard) and Uluhal. In some areas Asamodagam (dill seeds) and Sathakuppa were used instead of Aba (mustard) and Uluhal. Apart from this, various types of sours were used to make food tasty. Dehi (lemon), Dodam (orange), Goraka, Nasnaran, Gadadehi were used. The word ‘Karambembiya’ in old books means ‘Karapincha (curry leaves).

The oils which were used to cook food were commonly named as ‘Kana thel’. Its meaning is ‘the oil for eating’. Among them Dunthel and Githel (ghee) were major ones. ‘Polthel (coconut oil)’ was used less.

Consuming milk was common even among villagers. The name ‘Kirigeri’ can be seen in the inscriptions of the 9th century used for the cows in villages. The word ‘Dee Kiri’ too has been used in the inscriptions. It is clear that it was a custom of the people to eat curd. It is mentioned in Poojawaliya that a father says “Mage Duwaniyata Kiri Kannata Sarak Banakuth Dunamana Wedayi – (Shouldn’t I give a couple of cattle for my daughter to eat curd?)” at the moment when his daughter was about to leave her house on her marriage day.

Having various types of Kenda (gruel) was a custom of our country from very ancient time. It is an easily digestible food. Instead of the word ‘Kenda (gruel)’ the three words ‘Ambu’, ‘Hambu’, and ‘Kaadi’ have been used in our old books. When rice was boiled with salt mixed water, it was called ‘Diya Kenda’. The type of ‘Kenda’, which was made by mixing one portion of rice with six portions of water for patients, was called ‘Yawagu’. This was named as ‘Ulu Kenda’ as well. Today we call it ‘Lunu Kenda’. Various types of ‘Kenda’ (gruel) were made mixing various types of medicines for different kinds of illnesses. Saddharmarathnawaliya mentions a kind of very sweet gruel in the name of ‘Rasa Ulu Kenda’. It was cooked in milk without water, using bee honey and ghee. When it came to the right temperature, orange juice was mixed. Ancient people of this country drank Kenda as the first meal of the day. Those types of Kenda cooked mixing the leaves with medicinal quality were known as ‘Embulhambu’ or ‘Embul Kenda’.

There was animal meat consuming too. People in the ancient time used to eat meat of animals living on land as well as kinds of fish. The tax, which was charged for catching fish in the water channels that led from tanks to paddy fields, was called ‘Mathrika Mathsya Bhagaya’ then. Here, ‘Mathrika’ was small water channels

In the ancient time Sri Lankans were very attentive to their food. It seems that they had paid much attention to food and health because they had to be healthy and strong in activities of agriculture and animal husbandry. They never consumed artificial food. They used to consume natural things by preparing them without harming their nutritional value. It is a good example for us who live at present.",

        "content": "If the members in any society need to maintain their society in a desirable manner they should protect their environment. We have to face numerous adversaries if the environment is destroyed. There is the danger of getting shortage of water due to cutting trees. Crops may be less productive due to infertility of soil as a result of soil erosion. All these bad results have to be borne up by ourselves.

Our ancient rulers who were constantly conscious of the importance of protecting the environment, acted to impose laws on that. In the Anuradhapura plate inscription, made by king Mihindu IV, an order had been given forbidding clearing forests on high lands. There is a possibility of eroding soil and land slides due to clearing the forest on high lands. On the other hand it is a direct cause for drying water sources. There is an inscription, made by king Udaya III (935 – 938 A.D.), at a place called Buddhannehela in Anuradhapura. In that inscription there is a note as “Wal Wala Dandupath Nokapanu Isa”. Its meaning is that trees in the forests should not be cut. According to the rules in the Kondawattawan inscription, made by king Kashyapa V, government officers had been ordered to act according to the rules and regulations imposed by the government in managing trees and woods.

Rules and regulations regarding things such as protecting wild animals and soil protection can be seen in our ancient inscriptions. When we review all these facts, it is obvious that we had an organized procedure to protect the environment in ancient time.

What you should realize from the facts that we have discussed so far in this lesson, is that respectable citizens had lived in our country in the past. You should take as an example the way they, who had been settling in this country continuously for thousands years, applied their knowledge which was gathered through their life experiences and lived without being second to any nation in the world.",

The transformation of a rural settlement to an urban settlement is a very long and a gradual process. Certainly, what happens there is the life style of the people transforms from a rural form to an urban form. It happens as a result of a long process. On one hand, the internal economic development of the country affects that process directly. On the other hand, trade relations with foreign countries too affect that process decisively.

        "title": "Background of the Urban Life",
        "content": "The first urbanization in Sri Lanka is reflected by Anuradhapura which belongs to the North Central dry zone and ancient Magama city which had belonged to Southern and South-eastern part of Sri Lanka. There were basic signs of development in these two cities by about 450 B.C. That does not mean by then the things such as walls, moats, and streets, which were essentials for a city, had been constructed. A population with a life condition which is needed for a city could be seen.

You learnt in the second lesson that there is evidence, which goes back to 2400 B.C., that reflects that the proto-historical community who lived in this country abandoned their nomadic hunting life style and got used to an agricultural life style. The major change that occurred as they got used to agriculture was that they started to stay in one place for a long time. This was the basic reason for the origin of the most ancient villages in this country.

Those who lived in these basic villages were engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry as their livelihood. They engaged in hunting too. Due to agriculture and animal husbandry their food safety was ensured. Unless those people, who were engaged in those two occupations, had not been affected by natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and epidemics among animals, their life could have been more peaceful and co-existent.

There were signs of making a clear change among those who lived then due to their engagement in agriculture for a long time. It depended on a number of facts such as the nature of agricultural land and the skill each individual showed in managing the agricultural activities.

The farmers who cultivated lands where the soil was fertile and water was easily available had a good harvest and those who cultivated in infertile lands perhaps could have a harvest which was hardly enough for a year’s consumption. Those, who reaped a rich harvest, had an excess of grain remaining in the granaries after consuming during the whole year. This remaining grain is introduced in the special name ‘Athirikthaya’ – surplus. When there is an economic surplus in a society and a group of owners of surplus is a highly transformative situation. In this way, there is an example that shows that there lived a surplus owners in the ancient society of this country in ‘Jathakaatta Katha’. As it mentions, one villager, who didn’t have enough food as he had not received the harvest from his seasonal crop, borrowed a bag of paddy from the village leader on the promise that he would give it back on the following season.

This story in the ‘Jathkaatta Katha’ is a good clue that projects the transformation happening in the ancient society of our country. It gives us an idea of the villager who became poor due to the failure of his farming and the surplus owners who could help poor farmers.

As the surplus owner described in the above source was a village leader, there is an important fact that we should understand. That is, the major reason that affected him to be a village leader was that he was economically rich.

There is information in the inscriptions about the same type of provincial leaders introduced as ‘Parumaka’ and ‘Batha’. We learnet about ‘Parumakas’ in the third chapter.

The division as rich and poor, which occurs in the society based on the economic capability of people, is introduced as the origin of social stratification. One of the most important processes that based the origin of cities was this separation of the society in to strata.",

        "title": "The First Urbanization",
        "content": "By 450 B.C. the social stratification of our country had become complete to a certain extent. Early inscriptions substantiate that there were a large number of chieftains who owned production surplus, spread in the dry zone by that time. The number of the persons introduced by the name of ‘Parumaka’ in the inscriptions so far is numerous. These chieftains had been organized as families. One of the strategies that these families used to show and keep their power and prestige was using articles imported from foreign countries. Some articles such as imported earthenware and beads have been discovered from excavations done in the ancient cities such as Anuradhapura and Tissamaharama. These things were exchanged as a result of joining the foreign trade.

As Sri Lanka participated actively in the international trade activities operating then in the Indian Ocean, an immense wealth came into the country. The minority who was the owners of the production surplus were able to live a luxurious life as they were free from other external problems. Since the influx of income needed to be administered, the requirement of a mechanism of administration was felt.

The groups who became the chieftains due to possession of surplus gathered in a well planned settlement. Such a settlement with markets, religious buildings for offerings, aesthetic parks, defensive moats, and tanks is called a city. The description in Mahawamsa about how King Pandukabhaya planned Anuradhapura city proves that ancient Anuradhapura city was such a planned one with a finish.

Anuradhapura continued to be the capital of the Island for nearly 1400 years due to its self sufficiency with food and animal products produced by the village farmers and their efficient engagement in industries including iron industry and irrigation technology for a long time. Magama city which was in the Southern province was like a mirror which reflected the cultural advancement of that province.

After the 6th century A.D., the international trade operating in the Indian Ocean fell into the hands of Arab traders. The Western part of the Indian Ocean, which was the geographical centre of the international trade affairs in the Indian Ocean, was widened and the South-eastern Asia and the Southern China were annexed to it. After the 9th century A.D., the trade in the Indian Ocean was centering on the Eastern part of the Indian Ocean. Our farsighted rulers had understood the needs of activating the ports in the Eastern coast, administering the income which came into the country through those ports, preventing the threats to the security of the country from different people who entered the country through those places and basing a city very close to the coastal area for ruling if Sri Lanka wanted to obtain the benefits provided by this transformation. It seems that this situation had influenced directly King Vijayabahu I to select Polonnaruwa as his ruling centre.

When we examine the social background and the international relations existed during the time of king Parakramabahu I, who succeeded king Vijayabahu I, it is clear to what extent the South-eastern Asian trade relations had affected the political, religious and economic affairs of Sri Lanka during that time. As Mahawamsa mentions, several kings, who succeeded King Vijayabahu I, had married royal women from Asian countries such as, Burma and Cambodia.

The South- East Asian characteristics could prominently be seen in some of the art works created in this country during the period considered as the Polonnaruwa era, for example in some architectural creations and Buddha statues. The Buddha statues in Polonnaruwa Gal Viharaya and the building introduced as the Polonnaruwa Sathmahal Prasada are two best examples for it.",

        "title": "Downfall of Polonnaruwa",
        "content": "During the time when King Mihindu V was the last ruler of the Anuradhapura kingdom it collapsed due to Chola invasions and afterwards King Vijayabahu I liberated the country from the Cholas and united the country by making Polonnaruwa his capital. The political turmoil which prevailed after the demise of King Vijayabahu I due to the internal problems was ended and the country was reunited by King Parakramabahu I. He developed the capital Polonnaruwa further and made this country prosperous again by reconstructing the irrigation system. But, it seems that the Polonnaruwa kingdom fell into a track of gradual decline due to the political disorders emerged after the demise of King Parakramabahu I. After King Parakramabahu I, only King Nissankamalla carried out a strong ruling for nine years. There were several reasons for the gradual decline and the downfall of the Polonnaruwa kingdom.

Weak rulers came to power. During a period of 29 years from the year 1186 in which King Parakramabahu I’s demise took place and to the year 1215 in which the downfall of Polonnaruwa kingdom occurred, 12 rulers came to power from time to time. Among them, except for the 9 years’ ruling period of King Nissankamalla, the ruling periods of all the others’ were limited to very brief time periods. This clearly shows that those rulers could not build a political stability. It caused the decline of the Polonnaruwa kingdom.

Power struggle between the Pandyan and Kalinga clans After the death of King Vijayabahu I, the fights between the Pandyan and Kalinga clans who were in this country aggravated. As a result, the people who supported the Pandyan clan tried to bring Pandyan leaders to power. In the same way those who supported the Kalinga clan attempted to bring their leaders to power. As a result of this, the Kalingas, after the death of king Nissankamalla, who belonged to their clan, brought several Kalinga members such as, king Nissankamalla’s nephew (his sister’s son) Chodanga, his brother Sahasamalla, his wife Kalyanawathi to power. The Pandyans brought queen Leelawathi, the wife of king Parakramabahu I, to power thrice. Thus, the struggle between the Pandyans and the Kalingas was a reason for the decline of the Polonnaruwa kingdom.

Economic Deterioration Since weak rulers came to power after the death of King Nissankamalla and as they could not build a political stability, it seems that the tanks and anicuts were not maintained properly. As there were political disorder at this time, provincial ruling too may have been paralyzed. This led to a decline in agriculture and trade. This led to a complete economic paralysis.

Invasion of Kalinga Magha The immediate reason that affected the decline of the Polonnaruwa kingdom was the invasion of Kalinga Magha. When Magha invaded this country with a huge army in 1215, Sri Lankans could not face them due to the disordered political situation that prevailed in the country. As a result of that, the city of Polonnaruwa and a number of areas in Rajarata went under Magha’s army. When we consider the destruction, and the outcomes of the invasion of Magha, it made a great influence not only on the capital of Polonnaruwa, but also on the Rajarata civilization, which had a history of not less than one thousand and five hundred years.

This is a part from Mahawamsa, which describes the destruction caused by Magha: “People were tied, tortured and made them beggars by looting their wealth; statues were broken down, temples were robbed; devotees were attacked; children were beaten (..by the invaders).” Thus, due to the destructive activities of the enemies, there was no security for the lives and properties of the Rajarata people.

Its result was that the oppressed monks and the people migrated to Ruhuna, Malaya Rata (upcountry) or Maya rata for protection. Therefore, many areas in Rajarata were devoid of people. Some parts freed from the central ruling became rural areas. The religious places such as, Ruwanweli Seya, Abhayagiriya, and Jethawanaramaya, which were worshipped daily, were gradually went into wilderness. Many populated cities in Anuradhapura became ruins.

The reasons for the decline of the ancient cities:

Invasions of the enemies

Downfall of the central ruling

Lack of security

Paralysis of the trade and transport affairs

Migration of people to other areas",

        "title": "The Second Urbanization",
        "content": "When the prosperous cities existing in the dry zone declined, several cities, especially outside the dry zone, emerged in the South-eastern areas in no time. The emergence of these cities is a result of another process of urbanization. Operating several ruling centres due to decentralization of political power, growth of new harbours, reflecting a new intelligence awakening due to the rebirth of literature provide a sufficient base to introduce this process as a second urbanization. Another important trend that should be taken into consideration regarding the advancement of urbanization during this time is setting up of new trade relations network and widening of commercial activities with that.

When we compare the cities originated in the second urbanization process with the great cities that existed in the previous era, the main feature that could be seen is that the plans of the cities developed in the second urbanization had freed from the geometric structures of the previous ones. Even in the size, they were not as large as the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa ones. The scholars point out the reason for that is the decentralization of power after the second urbanization.

Dambadeniya

The period from the downfall of the Polonnaruwa kingdom in 1215 A.D to the establishment of the Dambadeniya kingdom in 1232 A.D was a chaotic time in this country. Mahawamsa mentions that in this difficult time when the capital was in the hands of the enemies, some local leaders had protected both the country and Buddhism from the enemies by building inaccessible places in safe areas. Subha Senevi who protected the area from enemies by building an inaccessible place in the Yapahuwa rock, the duke Buwanekabahu who prevented enemies from entering Ruhuna by making a citadel at the top of the Govindamalaya mountain, and Sankha Senevi who had built a citadel in the rock in Gandeniya close to Mahiyangana area were prominent among them.

Though they took much pains to act for the security of the country, none had a hope of going beyond their own purpose, which was defending their own ruling area, and uniting the country suppressing the enemy. It seems only one person acted with this purpose. He was a chieftain named Vijayabahu III. He lived in Dambadeniya. He ruled making Dambadeniya as his ruling centre in between 1232-1236. During this time Dambadeniya got developed consisting of all that needed for a city.

King Vijayabahu III established the Dambadeniya kingdom in 1232. His relationship with the old royal family in Anuradhapura is not clear. The sources mention that this king was a Wanni Nayaka- provincial leader earlier. Wanni means a kind of provincial ruling unit originated after the downfall of the Rajarata civilization. In this way, it seems that king Vijayabahu III too was a provincial leader at first, gradually became powerful, dispelled the enemies who were in Maya Rata and built Dambadeniya as his ruling centre. When Polonnaruwa was surrendered by enemies, the Bhikkus protected the tooth relic and the bowl relic. They took those sacred objects to Kothmale and protected them. King Vijayabahu III came to know of this and took steps to bring them to Dambadeniya. He built a Dalada Maligawa at Beligala and deposited them in it. This task of the king added an importance to the Dambadeniya Kingdom as the people considered that the possession of the tooth relic was the legal receipt of kingship. King Vijayabahu III performed a number of religious and national activities such as building Dambadeniya Vijesundararamaya, reconstructing Kelani temple, making a Sanga amendment by holding the Upasampada festival again and taking steps to rewrite the books in disuse. His ruling time was 4 years and he died in 1236.

King Parakramabahu II (1236 A.D. – 1270 A.D.)

King Vijayabahu III had two sons namely Parakramabahu and Buvanekabahu. After his death, his elder son, Parakramabahu became the king of Dambadeniya in 1236. He is named as king Parakramabahu II. King Parakramabahu II had a good education in his childhood. He had his education from the Bhikkus led by Sangharakkhitha Thero when his father was living and later became an educated erudite. He was offered the scholarly title Kalikala Sahithya Sarwagna Panditha. The great books he composed remain even today.

By the time king Parakramabahu II attained the kingship, the country was not freed from the clutches of the enemies. And also he had to face a new invader. He had a number of challenges before him, including bringing the life style of the countrymen to normalcy and acting for the betterment of religion and education. However, the king was able to overcome all these challenges since he was educated and intelligent.

When King Parakramabahu II was getting ready to fight with Kalinga Magha that is in the 11th year of his ruling (1247 A.D.), a Javaka invader named Chandrabhanu landed in this country with a large group of soldiers. Though all the invasions came to Sri Lanka from India so far, Chandrabhanu arrived from the Northern part of the Malaya peninsula in the South- East Asia. As that area was a Buddhist country then, the purpose of Chandrabhanu may have been to possess the sacred Buddhist relics. In 1247 A.D. Chandrabhanu’s army was repulsed by the Sri Lankan army led by king Parakramabahu II.

The greatest challenge that King Parakramabahu II had to face was to liberate the country from Magha’s ruling. Magha ruled the areas in Rajarata for about 40 years and had reinforced the security by building citadels around the area. Therefore, a decisive attack had to be made on Magha. According to a plan of the king, the army was directed to besiege Polonnaruwa city from the eastern and western sides. Magha’s soldiers, in the surrounding citadels, had gathered to Polonnaruwa to face the king’s army. Magha’s army had had a debacle at the attack launched by the king’s army. It is believed that this decisive battle took place in around 1255 A.D. Liberating the country from Magha was a great achievement of the king.

Chandrabhanu, who fled after suffering a defeat in the previous battle with the army of the king, had invaded Sri Lanka once again in about 1261 A.D. by obtaining mercenary soldiers from India. Chandrabhanu, who came with a large army, besieged Yapahuwa and threatened the king to hand over the state, the tooth relic and the bowl relic. Once again there was a great battle between the king’s army and the army of Chandrabhanu. In this battle king Parakramabahu II had the support from the Pandyan Empire. In this battle, the enemies were defeated and the invader Chandrabhanu too was killed. King Parakramabahu II saved the country from the enemies and at the same time he took steps to use the minister named Deva Pathiraja to develop the economic, religious and educational sectors.

Yapahuwa

As king Parakramabahu II passed away in about 1270 A.D, his son prince Vijayabahu attained the kingship. He is named as Vijayabahu IV. The name Bosath Vijayabahu too was used for him. His reign was limited only for two years. He died due to a military coup. After that, prince Buvanekabahu, who was the brother of king Vijayabahu IV, overcame the conspirators and became the king in about 1272. He is named as king Buvanekabahu I. He faced a number of problems. As soon as he became the king, a group of provincial leaders rebelled against him. During the same time several south Indian forces invaded Sri Lanka. One invasion was led by an army general named Kalingarayara. Another platoon was led by one army general named Chodanga. The king faced all these adversaries successfully and spent a few years in Dambadeniya. Later the king selected Yapahuwa, since it was a safer place, as his capital. King Buvanekabahu I was very interested in having trade relations with foreign countries. It is reported that a group of ambassadors sent by the king to the Sultan in Egypt to discuss to develop trade relations with Egypt had been welcomed in Cairo in the month of April in 1283. After some time of that event, king Buvanekabahu I died in 1284.

It seems after the demise of king Buvanekabahu, a dispute was started among prince Parakramabahu, the son of Bosath Vijayabahu and prince Buvanekabahu II, the son of king Buvanekabahu I about the kingship. During this time a provincial leader from the South India named Arya Chackrawarthi had arrived in Sri Lanka with a Pandya army, attacked the Yapahuwa citadel, took the tooth relic to South India and handed it over to King Kulashekara, who was the Pandyan king. Later the son of king Bosath Vijayabahu, prince Parakramabahu went to India, met king Kulashekara, discussed with him and brought the tooth relic back. He went to Polonnaruwa and started his ruling. This king is named as Parakramabahu III. His ruling period started in 1287 A.D. But, prince Buvanekabahu II besieged Polonnaruwa, defeated the king and took back the tooth relic to Kurunegala in about 1293. He made Kurunegala his capital.

Kurunegala

The first ruler who established the Kurunegala kingdom was king Buvanekabahu II. His ruling time was 9 years from 1293 A.D. After the death of king Buvanekabahu II, his son, prince Parakramabahu acceded to the kingship in Kurunegala. Since he was the fourth Parakramabahu we meet in the history of this country, he is named as Parakramabahu IV. According to the Tamil poetry Sarajothimaleyi, he became the king in 1302 A.D.

Much service was done to the uplifting of Buddhism as well as education during the Kurunegala ruling period. One of the most prominent services done during this era was translating the Jataka story book, which was in Pali language until then, into Sinhala. The texts like Dalada Siritha, Sinhala Bodhiwamsa, Anagatha Wamsaya, and Dalada Poojavaliya were written during this period. It is mentioned that after king Parakramabahu IV, the two kings named Buvanekabahu III or Vanni Buvanekabahu and Vijayabahu V or Savulu Vijayabahu ruled Kurunegala respectively. Much information has not been disclosed about the activities of these kings. However, folklores mention that king Buvanekabahu III constructed the Kurunegala tank.

Gampola Kingdom

The Gampola kingdom was established by king Buvanekabahu IV in 1341. He is believed to be a son of King Savulu Vijayabahu, who was the last ruler of the Kurunegala kingdom. King Buvanekabahu IV had another brother and he maintained his ruling by building a kingdom in Dedigama at the same time period as Parakramabahu V. When the Gampola kingdom started, there were two other kingdoms except for Dedigama. There was a kingdom in Jaffna under Aryachakravarthi dynasty and another one in Rayigama under Alakeshwara lineage. Therefore, the Gampola kingdom had to face many challenges.

There were several special characteristics of the Gampola ruling period. There were two respectable–families having connections with the Royal family, which was one characteristic. Senadhilankara Senevirath family in Gampola was one. Senadhilankara Senevi Dedigama had married a sister of King Parakramabahu III and the one who became the king in Gampola in the name of Vikramabahu was a son of them. The second respectable family was the Alakeshwara family in Rayigama. The prominent figure in this family was Nissanka Alakeshwara.

In the Gampola period, kingship did not pass to son from father or from brother to brother. It was the old system. The system which was practised in Gampola period was passing kingship from uncle to nephew or to a son of a sister of the ex-king. This was a mother-central system (matriachy) more than a father-central system (patriachy).

One significant fact was that one Arab traveller named Iban Batuta came to Sri Lanka during the Gampola period and he recorded what he witnessed and heard. Iban Batuta, who came to Jaffna in 1344, had journeyed to Adam’s Peak (Sri Pada) by gaining assistance from the Jaffna ruler, Arya Chakravarthi. Batuta mentions a ruler named Alakonar who possessed a white elephant (tusker). That Alakonar was a one of the Alagakkonara lineage.

It is mentioned by the ruling period of Gampola Vikramabahu III the officers of Aryachakravarthi in the North had come to Gampola and collected taxes from some areas. This was a blow not only to the independence of the Gampola kingdom but also to its economy. Therefore, the chief minister of the King, Nissanka Alakeshvara, built a fortress in Kotte and had punished the tax officers of the King Aryachakravarthi. When Aryachakravarthi, who was angry with this treatment, invaded Gampola kingdom, his army was defeated by the Alakeshwara’s army. Though the actions followed by Nissanka Alakeshvara made the Gampola kingdom strong, it seems with time there were disputes among the Alakeshwara family itself.

In the last period of the Gampola kingdom, there was a Chinese invasion in Sri Lanka. An army general named Chen Ho sent by the Chinese emperor called Yung Lo landed in this country in the years of 1405, 1409, and 1411. When he came to this country in 1409, the then Rayigama ruler Veera Alakeshvara had not welcomed Chen Ho properly. Therefore, he had offered the offerings he had brought to the Devundara Devala and left after making an inscription written in Chinese, Persian and Tamil languages. That inscription is known as the Trilingual letter in Galle. Afterwards general Chen Ho, who came to this country back in 1411 with a large army and fought against the army of Alakeshvara and captured him along with some others as prisoners, and went back to China.

Several buildings, constructed during the Gampola ruling period still remain and Lankathilaka and Gadaladeni temples built by king Buvanekabahu IV are prominent among them.

Kotte Kingdom

We mentioned above that minister Nissanka Alakeshvara built a strong fortress in Kotte during the Gampola ruling period. But, the Kotte kingdom was established by king Parakramabahu VI. His father was one Jayamahalena. His mother was Sunethra Devi. Since there were adversaries during the last part of the Gampola ruling period, prince Parakramabahu had to live in hiding. Here, Veedagama Thero provided him protection. Afterwards, in 1412 prince Parakramabahu came to power in Rayigama with the courtesy of Veedagama Thero. After three years’ time in 1415 he came to Kotte, which was famous as a safe place, and held his coronation. From then on he ruled the country for a long time until 1467. These are prominent in King Parakramabahu’s service.

Bringing Wanni areas under the Kotte kingdom.

Winning Jaffna by sending the army under prince Sapumal.

Suppressing the rebellion raised by Count Jothiya, who was the provincial ruler of Uda Rata.

Uniting the country under the Kotte kingdom and making the country prosperous.

Making a great contribution to the enhancement of country’s education and literature.

As there was not an heir to the throne after king Parakramabahu VI's demise, the son of his daughter, Ulakudaya Deviya, acceded to the throne in the name of Jayabahu. But his ruling time was short. Prince Sapumal, who was assigned to rule Jaffna by King Parakramabahu VI after capturing Jaffna, came with an army, besieged Kotte capital and usurped power by assassinating king Jayabhu. He became the king in the name of Buvanekabahu VI in 1469. At the beginning of his ruling a rebellion named Pasyodun Rata Sinhala Peraliya or Sinhala Sange started. This rebellion was suppressed by prince Ambulugala under the guidance of King Buvanekabahu. The king forgave the rebel leaders including Kekulandala Siriwardana Pathiraja. The inscription made for this is known as ‘Abhayadana Shilalipiya’ or ‘Dedigama Inscription’.

After the demise of king Buvanekabahu VI, one of his sons named Panditha Parakramabahu came to power. He was known as Parkaramabahu VII and his ruling time was not a long one. Prince Ambulgala, who was in charge of ruling affairs in Sathara Koralaya, came, dethroned Panditha Parakramabahu and became the king in the name of Veera Parakramabahu VIII. It is believed that he came to power in 1490 A.D. The Portuguese arrived in this country during his ruling time in 1505.

Jaffna and the Vanniyars

The ruling unit, which started in the Jaffna area after the downfall of Rajarata civilization, is known as the Jaffna kingdom. There are no contemporary sources to study the beginning and the history of this kingdom and the most famous book which assists to study its history is Yalpana Vayipava Maleyi. But it was written in the 18th century. Apart from these, the Tamil texts such as Kayilaya Maleyi and Shegarashashekara Maleyi are also important.

The founder of the Jaffna kingdom was Vijay Kulankeyi Arya Chakravarthi. There is a description in the Yalpana Vayipava Maleyi text about twelve rulers such as Kulashekara, Vikkirama, Varodaya, Marthanda from the ruling time of Arya Chakravarthi to the arrival of Portuguese. The royal dynasty who ruled Jaffna was named as Arya Chakravarthis. It seems when Iban Batuta came to this country in 1344, the Arya Chakravarthis had a strong ruling. We mentioned earlier how minister Nishshanka Alakeshvara acted against the representatives of Arya Chakravarthi, who collected taxes in the areas belonging to the Gampola kingdom. During the Kotte period King Parakramabahu VI sent prince Sapumal and brought Jaffna under the Kotte kingdom. After king Parakrambahu VI, the ruling over the Jaffna area loosened from the grip of Kotte. From then on we will discuss the information of the Jaffna kingdom until it surrendered to the Portuguese in the tenth lesson.The Vanniyars

After the downfall of Rajarata civilization, small ruling units called Vanni emerged in the areas with low population density, such as East, North central and North Western. The provincial rulers in these units were known as the Vanniyars. According to Poojavaliya Vijayabahu III who established the Dambadeniya kingdom was a Vanni leader at first. The contemporary sources say that there were eighteen such Vanni areas by the time when king Parakramabahu VI started his ruling. Though the Vanniyars enjoyed some independence during the time when the central government was weak, during the ruling periods of King Parakramabahu II and king Parakramabahu VI the Vanni areas were under the main kingdom. There is information that there were Vanniyars in the Eastern area during the Kandyan kingdom. But they were under the Kandyan king.",

        "content": "The people, who migrated to the wet zone after the collapse of the Rajarata civilization, had to adjust themselves to a new geographical environment. Origin of kingdoms in the areas where there were ghats and non existence of the capital at one place for a long time are special features of this. As the wet zone received a good rainfall, it seems that they did not pay much attention to construct huge tanks and irrigation systems. They tended to use rainwater for the agricultural activities. Even during this time, their main livelihood was agriculture. The main cultivation was paddy and Chena cultivation was done in areas which lacked water.

Gradually they tended to a commercial economy. The surplus of the crops grown for food was sold. The reason for this was that the international trade relations got more developed.

Cinnamon, which grew in the forest areas in the wet zone, was a main trade crop during this time. The surplus of the crops such as aricanuts, cardamom, nutmeg and pepper was exported. Apart from these, trade items such as pearls, gems, tuskers and tusks were exported.

Sri Lanka had trade relations with India, Arab, China, Persia and Egypt. International trade was under the monopoly of king.

The rich trade that existed in ancient Sri Lanka has been mentioned in literary, archaeological sources as well as in tourist records. The archaeological evidences found in Dedigama reveal that porcelain has been imported from China. The ola leaves called Kurunegala description mentions that there were bazaars related to internal trade. The Arab traveller named Iban Batuta, who came to Sri Lanka in 1344 A.D., has mentioned in his records that there was a rich trading in harbours in the Western coasts.",

        "content": "During the second urbanization period Buddhism grew as further as the main religion. The kings from Dambadeni to Kotte periods acted to build palaces for the sacred Tooth relic and construct many temples and monasteries.

There are proofs that the people of this time had a great devotion and belief in god. They believed in the gods such as Upulwan, Vibheeshana, Skandakumar and Saman and constructed Devalas for the gods. There is a reference to the gods Upulwan and Vibhishana in Sandesha Kavyas.

There is information that there was a Shiva Devala adjacent to Sri Jayawardhanpura in the fifteenth century. It is believed that it must have been constructed for Siva devotees.

The Munneshvaram temple in Chilaw was a sacred religious place for the Hindus during this time.

There were sacred Islamic religious places in sea port areas where the Muslim devotees resided and engaged in their international trade affairs.",

        "content": "A lot of architecture could be seen in the cities, which were created from Yapahuwa period to Kotte period. It is a special feature that these creations have been influenced by the South Indian architecture.

It is believed that the steps in the Yapahuwa kingdom and creations of its posts have had the Pandyan and Cambodian influences. It could clearly be noticed that the contemporary South Indian architectural styles had influenced the Pilimageya (Idol-house) at the Gadaladeniya temple which belonged to the Gampola period. Another feature that could be seen in these periods is constructing Devals connecting to the Pilimageyas (Idol-houses).

One example for this is that a Devala has been built for God Upulvan connecting to the Gadaladeniya Pilimageya. Devalas have been built connecting to Lankathilaka Pilimageya too. Having Devalas in the idol-houses is a proof that displays that the Hindu and Mahayana ideas influenced the architecture.

The Embekke Devala, which was constructed by king Wickramabahu III during the Gampola period is a valuable construction with wood carvings. Its magnificence is displayed by its posts with beautiful wood carvings and its wooden roof.

There are a lot of evidences to prove that there was a great revival in language and literature during the second urbanization. Learned monks, kings’ sponsoring, and having a number of educational centres influenced the advancement of literature.

During the ruling period of King Parakramabahu II in Dambadeniya, many literary texts were written. He was given the honorary title Kalikala Sahithya Sarvagna Panditha. Several literary texts were written by him. It is accepted that Kawsilumina, one of the great Sinhalese literary works, was written by King Parakramabahu II. Saddharmarathnawaliya written by Dharmasena Thero, and Poojawaliya written by Mayurapada Parivenadhipathi Buddhaputhra Thero were two significant prose texts written during the Dambadeniya period. Sidath Sangarawa on Sinhalese grammar, Elusandes Lakuna on prosody too belonged to this period. Dambadeni Kathikavatha, which consists of the disciplinary rules of the monks, Kandawuru Siritha, which describes the daily routine of king Parakramabahu II and the valuable medicinal text name Yogarnvaya written by Buddha Puthra Thero were written during the Dambdeniya period. There are several important texts written in Pali language during this time. Vishuddhi Marga Sannasa, Samanthakuta Varnana, Rasavahini, Sara Sangrahaya, the medicinal book named Bhessajja Manjusa, Hathvanagalla Vihara Vansaya and Thupavamsa are examples for that.

During Kurunegala period the Sinhalese prose literature was further advanced. Translating Pansiya Panas Jataka Potha into Sinhala, Dalada Siritha, Dalda Poojavaliya, and Sinhala Bodhi Vamsa were written during this period.

Writing Sandesha Kavya started during the Gampola period. Mayura Sandesha and Thisara Sandesha are considered as the oldest Sandesha Kavyas. Pali texts such as Parami Shathakaya, Jeenabodhavali, Balavathara and Saddharmalankaraya too were written during this period.

The Kotte period was the golden age of Sinhalese literature. The period of Perakumba VI made a great service to the literature. King Parakramabahu VI was a great ruler as well as a pedant. There were a number of learned people who contributed to the advancement of literature.

Thotagamuve Sri Rahula Thero, Keragala Vanarathana Thero, Irugalthilaka Piriven Thero were learned monks who nurtured the literature.

Perakumba Siritha, Kavyashekaraya, Budugunalankaraya, Loweda Sangarava, Guttila Kavya, Hansa, Parevi, Gira, Selalihini Sandesha Kavayas were written by these literati.

Another important feature is that the texts like Bhakthi Kavya, Shilo Kavya, Hatan Kavya, Prashasthi Kavya, Upadesha Kavya, Kosha Grantha, directed the literature to different aspects. Sanskrit texts too were written and Bhakthi Shathakaya is an example for that.

A number of Buddhist educational centres came into being during this time. King Parakramabahu VI built Pepilayane Sunethradevi Pirivena in memory of his mother. The Buddhist centers such as Keragala Padmavathi Pirivena, Devinuvara Irugalkulathilaka Pirivena, Veedagama Ghunananda Pirivena did a great service to the advancement of literature.",
