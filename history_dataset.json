        "content": "But Thutmose was determined to defy his enemies and, by taking the most dangerous route, show that he didn t fear them. He swore an oath by the sun god Amun-Re, saying:  My Majesty will march by this Aruna Road!  He also determined that he himself would lead the army through the narrow pass.  None shall march on this road in front of my Majesty and (when the time came) he himself did march at the head of his army, showing the way with his own steps.  The route he chose was just over eight miles long, with parts of it only 30 feet wide. With steep walls on either side, it was the perfect place for the enemy to ambush an advancing army from above, as there was no room for maneuver. However, assuming the Egyptians would never risk such reckless exposure, the enemy had only stationed soldiers on the other two paths. Thutmose s army was able to march the route through the Aruna pass in one day without any problem. The soldiers emerged into the Qina valley to the astonishment of enemy troops who were encamped near the city of Megiddo. (The last missing tomb from this wealthy Egyptian dynasty has been found) The Egyptian advance At dawn the following day the Egyptian army was mobilized, dividing and deploying in three large units that advanced in crescent formation toward an encampment of Asian forces to the south of Megiddo. The inscription at Karnak records that:  The southern wing of his Majesty s army was at a hill south of the Qina [brook], and the northern wing to the northwest of Megiddo, while his Majesty was in their center, [Amun] protecting his person (in) the tumult, and the strength of [Seth pervading] his limbs.

SCALA, FLORENCE MILITARY OFFICIALS of ancient Egypt who won fame and fortune could expect a lavish tomb. The achievements of Thutmose III s commander Amenemheb (nicknamed Mahu) are partially preserved on a wall of his tomb. They record that he fought in many Asian campaigns, killing and capturing enemies, amassing a substantial booty, and being rewarded by Thutmose III with promotions and expensive gifts. They also relate several curious episodes, such as when he killed a mare in heat that the ruler of Kadesh had sent into the ranks of Egyptian chariots to distract the horses, or when he helped the pharaoh kill an elephant after a military operation in Syria. This reference provides tantalizing evidence that the pharaohs of the time hunted elephants in the Syrian region of Niya after having fought their northern enemies. That maneuver sparked panic among the enemy warriors; many of them abandoned their tents and rushed toward Megiddo. The pharaoh s troops set about plundering their camp, which allowed many of the Asian forces to escape. A NARROW PASS Thutmose III leads his troops toward Megiddo through the perilous Aruna pass. Choosing this route was a bold initiative that allowed the pharaoh to surprise the enemy. BRIDGEMAN/ACI Some Asian commanders were hoisted to safety over the walls of Megiddo by those inside who were defending the city. Others must have run northward to get as far away from the Egyptian troops as possible. The chronicles point out with a certain bitterness that if the soldiers of Thutmose III had pursued the fleeing troops in that phase of the confrontation, the victory would have been quick and definitive:  When they [the enemy chiefs] saw his Majesty overwhelming them, they fled headlong [to] Megiddo with terrified faces, abandoning their horses, their chariots of gold and silver, so as to be hoisted up into the town by pulling at their garments. For the people had shut the town behind them, and they now [lowered] garments to hoist them up into the town. Now if his Majesty s troops had not set their hearts to plundering the possessions of the enemies, they would have [captured] Megiddo at this moment.  This portion was less of a battle and more like a series of skirmishes with the Egyptians on the offensive. MISSION MEGIDDO Located on a hill in the north of present-day Israel, Megiddo controlled the important trade route linking Egypt with Mesopotamia in the mid-15th century B.C. ALAMY/CORDON PRESS Siege and victory Faced with the impossibility of taking the city by assault, the Egyptians decided to besiege it, building a series of fortifications with wood they obtained by felling trees in the surrounding area. The Annals of Thutmose III show how he emphasized the strategic importance of conquering Megiddo:  Every prince of every [northern] land is shut up within it, the capture of Megiddo is the capture of a thousand cities!  Finally, after seven months of siege, the city surrendered. Among the enemy leaders captured inside was the ruler of Megiddo. The prince of Kadesh, commander in chief of the Asian coalition, did, however, manage to escape. The Aruna pass A key moment in Thutmose III s triumphant first campaign and conquest of Megiddo was the daring decision made by the pharaoh to enter the Aruna pass. The Canaanite forces had left this route unguarded, believing the pharaoh would not expose his army to the possibility of deadly attack from the high ground on either side of the gorge. By taking this risky route, the Egyptian forces were able to take their enemy by surprise at Megiddo, the fortress where the troops of the princes of Retjenu (as the Egyptians called the region of Syria and Canaan) were concentrated. The Egyptians gave their opponents no time to react. At dawn the next day, they were deployed in three divisions that advanced on the Canaanites and their allies with the intention of subduing their flanks and overwhelming them. Thutmose III was in the central division. Unable to resist the onslaught, the Asian troops fled in disarray and several of their leaders ran to take refuge in the walled city of Megiddo while the Egyptians were engaged in looting their camp. As the Megiddo fortress defenders had closed their gates to prevent the Egyptians from forcing their way in, the fleeing commanders had to be hoisted ignominiously over the city wall by ropes tied to their clothes. Megiddo would finally fall after seven months of siege. An extraordinary booty The written sources preserve a long and detailed list of the booty obtained after the conquest of Megiddo. They indicate that there were 83 enemy dead and 340 prisoners, but these figures may only include individuals who were seen as significant. The Jabal Barkal victory stele, erected by Thutmose III in Nubia, recounts several of his campaigns in Asia. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. FINE ARTS, BOSTON/SCALA, FLORENCE AFTER THE VICTORY AT MEGIDDO, Thutmose consolidated his power to the north, in Asia, and to the south, in Nubia. In the 33rd year of his reign, he launched a direct attack against the Mitanni Empire that had  the anti-Egyptian unrest. Mitanni lay beyond the Euphrates River, so Thutmose transported boats by ox-drawn carts from the coastal city of Byblos (today in Lebanon). Using these boats, the Egyptians were able to cross the Euphrates, crushing the Mitanni state and strengthening Egypt s hold over the whole region. Thutmose III erected a victory stele far in the south of his lands at Jabal Barkal in Nubia, today in Sudan. He characterized himself as conqueror of both southerners and northerners  who massacres the tribes of Asia...and who smites the nomads of Nubia.  Apart from herds, provisions, and other objects, the Egyptian army took 2,041 horses; 924 chariots, among which were the chariots carved in gold belonging to the rulers of Kadesh and Megiddo; 200 sets of armor; and 502 composite bows. These bows, of Mesopotamian origin, were very expensive and highly sought after. The body armor, made of hardened leather or bronze mail, was innovative at that time. There is no mention of helmets, although their use was widespread during the rule of Thutmose III. This is demonstrated both by the lists of tributes from Asia and by the paintings in some private Theban tombs in which foreigners paying tribute are shown wearing helmets. (Nubian kings ruled Egypt for less than 100 years. Their influence lasted centuries.)

SCALA, FLORENCE Myth and might The immediate consequence of the victory was the consolidation of pharaonic control over much of what is today Israel and the Palestinian territories. The stunning victory, and expansion of the pharaoh s control, would live in the Egyptian imagination as the beginning of a new era of regional greatness. General Djehuty, appointed governor of the conquered areas by Thutmose, would later be immortalized as the hero in an ancient Egyptian tale,  The Taking of Joppa.  Recounting how Djehuty used his ingenuity to conquer the city of Joppa (modern-day Jaffa, near Tel Aviv, Israel) by smuggling soldiers into the city hidden in baskets, this story preceded the Trojan horse plot device used in Homer s epic poem The Iliad by centuries. It is also a likely source for the Arabic folk tale  Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,  in which the eponymous thieves attempt to smuggle themselves into a house in jars of lamp oil. THUTMOSE THE CONQUEROR This relief at the seventh pylon Karnak Temple Complex symbolizes the victories of Thutmose III over his enemies, who cower as he prepares to crush them with his mace. ALAMY/CORDON PRESS Beyond inspiring great stories, the Megiddo triumph forged new political and diplomatic realities across the region: The new Canaanite territory provided a closer starting point for Egypt to launch future campaigns into Mesopotamia. News of the impressive victory prompted monarchies in the Near East to send ambassadors to Thebes, capital of Egypt, with sumptuous gifts, hoping to curry favor with the pharaoh. (These crocodile mummies are unraveling a mystery) Following his victory, Thutmose III leveraged his position to expand Egypt s power in Asia through an ambitious program of conquests in Syria. The Annals inscribed on the walls of the Temple of Amun-Re at Karnak mention 16 other campaigns, although, in some cases, no details have been preserved. These military operations took place between 1454 and 1437 B.C. and can be divided into distinct phases. The first phase involved the conquest of important port cities, such as Ullaza and Simyra, to facilitate transport to and from Egypt and provide storage points. The second phase involved the occupation of much of central Syria, thereby neutralizing the strength of the city of Kadesh. The third phase consisted of a direct attack on Mitannian territories, while the fourth phase included a series of campaigns aimed at suppressing uprisings in certain conquered territories. Even accounting for Thutmose s campaign of self-mythologization, and the inevitable exaggeration that is built into the claims and boasts of the Annals of Thutmose III, many scholars view the details of this account as a reliable source. In fact, the Battle of Megiddo is one of the earliest well-documented battles of history. This major turning point not only expanded Egyptian territory but also marked the first solo success of one of the greatest military leaders in ancient Egypt.",

        "content": "Analysis of the paintings inside the tomb suggests that two teams of artists carried out the work.The most skilled one worked on the left side of the tomb, and the other worked on the right. First, the rock walls were covered with plaster, and onto this outlines of the figures were traced with red paint and then corrected with black paint.Next came the artisans, who carved reliefs into the plaster following the painted outlines. Finally, the painters brought to life the walls and ceilings through the use of color. Over time, some layers of stucco that had been applied too thickly began to peel and fall off under their own weight. Remarkably, the damage was relatively minor and the paintings, now restored, provide a unique artistic insight into how the inhabitants of pharaonic Egypt understood death and the afterlife. (How a single battle and one young pharaoh turned Egypt into a superpower) Nefertari s journey to the afterlife The artistic conventions of the day are reflected in how the tomb was painted. Royal tombs were conceived as a microcosm, a world in themselves. The ceilings symbolized the sky, and the floor was the earth the deceased would become a part of. The burial chamber where the sarcophagus of the deceased king or queen was placed represented the kingdom of Osiris, the god of the underworld. It was believed Osiris presided over the tribunal that judged the soul, determining whether the person had been righteous enough to pass into immortality.

The underground world of Osiris Nefertari s funeral ends with the transfer of her mummy to the burial chamber. This is symbolically the domain of Osiris, the god who embodies royal figures after death while simultaneously judging whether or not they are fit to enjoy immortality.

A research team led by retired organic chemist Dr. Corrado Malanga and former academic and remote sensing expert Dr. Filippo Biondi, claim to have discovered and reconstructed enormous 38,000-year-old structures buried deep underneath the pyramid of Khafre at Giza. In a press conference held in Italy, Malanga and Biondi announced that through the development of a new proprietary method for interpreting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals, they were able to detect structures two kilometers beneath the Khafre pyramid. According to Malanga and Biondi, they discovered eight shafts, surrounded by spiral pathways, that connect to two 90-meter cube-shaped structures. Above the shafts, they claim to have found five structures connected to one another by passageways. Using what appears to be AI-generated reconstructions, they, and others, have hypothesized that these structures are part of a legendary ancient city or even a prehistoric power-generating structure (i.e. a power station). Rumors of hidden structures underneath the Giza plateau are nothing new. The idea dates to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus and intermittently bubbled to the surface of popular consciousness throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They became particularly popular among French scholars in the 19th century and again in the 20th century when American psychic Edgar Cayce popularized the idea that a secret hall of records was buried underneath the pyramid complex. The concept of a power station, allegedly built by aliens, has also been bouncing around pseudoscientific circles for a while. It is part of a broader conspiracy theory that credits impressive ancient architectural projects to aliens. (How cosmic rays helped find a tunnel in Egypt's Great Pyramid.)

In 1902, British archaeologists excavated him from his tomb carved into a limestone hillside in the Nuwayrat necropolis, more than 150 miles south of Cairo. While the pharaohs of his time built colossal monuments like the Great Pyramid of Giza, this man, likely a potter who lived 4,500 to 4,800 years ago, left behind a different kind of legacy: his exceptionally well-preserved DNA. (This ancient Egyptian woman may have died in childbirth) Somehow, his remains endured centuries of scorching Egyptian heat and even Nazi bombings while housed in Liverpool, England, during World War II. Now scientists have sequenced the first whole genome of an ancient Egyptian from intact DNA extracted from his teeth. The study, published Wednesday in Nature, describes the oldest Egyptian DNA ever recovered, radiocarbon dated to between 2855 and 2570 B.C. This was during the end of the Early Dynastic and the beginning of the Old Kingdom periods, when Egypt s rulers consolidated power and ushered in the  Age of the Pyramids.   There are hundreds, if not thousands, of ancient genomes from across the world,  says Linus Girdland-Flink, a biomolecular archaeologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and a co-corresponding author of the paper. To date, scientists have collected ancient DNA from Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Homo sapiens from 45,000 years ago.  Yet, Egypt has remained a kind of white spot on the map of this big puzzle of human genetic ancestry.  Previously, the oldest DNA recovered from ancient Egypt came from three mummies buried at the Abusir el-Meleq necropolis and dated between 787 and 23 B.C. But those sequences only represented partial genomes. The new genome is complete and comes from an individual who lived some 1,500 years earlier.",

        "content": "Analysis of the paintings inside the tomb suggests that two teams of artists carried out the work.The most skilled one worked on the left side of the tomb, and the other worked on the right. First, the rock walls were covered with plaster, and onto this outlines of the figures were traced with red paint and then corrected with black paint.Next came the artisans, who carved reliefs into the plaster following the painted outlines. Finally, the painters brought to life the walls and ceilings through the use of color. Over time, some layers of stucco that had been applied too thickly began to peel and fall off under their own weight. Remarkably, the damage was relatively minor and the paintings, now restored, provide a unique artistic insight into how the inhabitants of pharaonic Egypt understood death and the afterlife. (How a single battle and one young pharaoh turned Egypt into a superpower) Nefertari s journey to the afterlife The artistic conventions of the day are reflected in how the tomb was painted. Royal tombs were conceived as a microcosm, a world in themselves. The ceilings symbolized the sky, and the floor was the earth the deceased would become a part of. The burial chamber where the sarcophagus of the deceased king or queen was placed represented the kingdom of Osiris, the god of the underworld. It was believed Osiris presided over the tribunal that judged the soul, determining whether the person had been righteous enough to pass into immortality. PRIESTS One of the two sem, or funerary, priests is dressed in leopard s skin and wears a side braid, indicating his youth. The priests received the queen and were in charge of the funeral rites. S. VANNINI/ALBUM If the judgment was favorable, the deceased began their ascent to rebirth with the sun god, Re. This transition involved a challenging journey during which the soul had to demonstrate certain knowledge and make offerings to the divine beings. The phases of this passage were detailed in the Book of the Dead. Nefertari s tomb was decorated and designed to help her on this journey, guiding the queen toward a full and happy life beyond death. The underground world of Osiris Nefertari s funeral ends with the transfer of her mummy to the burial chamber. This is symbolically the domain of Osiris, the god who embodies royal figures after death while simultaneously judging whether or not they are fit to enjoy immortality. Images of Osiris decorate the four pillars that support the room: On each pillar, he appears in human form and in symbolic form as the djed symbol. The mummy of Nefertari is put inside a large pink granite sarcophagus of which the lid, although broken, has been preserved. This sarcophagus is placed in the lower area of the room, which symbolizes the primordial earth, the origin of the world, and all that is in it.",

The process began with plaster-covered walls, onto which figures were first outlined in red, then corrected in black, before skilled carvers incised reliefs. Finally, vibrant pigments brought the sacred narrative to life across the walls and ceilings. Despite some natural wear where stucco had loosened, the restored paintings offer invaluable insights into ancient Egyptian beliefs surrounding death and the profound journey to the afterlife.\n\nConceived as a sacred microcosm, the tomb's architecture itself mirrored the cosmos: ceilings depicted the celestial sky, while the floor symbolized the earth. At its heart, the burial chamber served as the kingdom of Osiris, the revered god of the underworld, who presided over the soul's critical judgment. Should the deceased be deemed righteous, a challenging ascent to rebirth alongside the sun god Re would commence, a complex passage detailed in the Book of the Dead and facilitated by the tomb's guiding artistry.\n\nWithin this subterranean realm, funerary priests orchestrated the sacred rites, preparing the queen for her transition. The burial chamber, permeated by the presence of Osiris – depicted in human form and as the enduring djed symbol on its supporting pillars – housed Nefertari's mummy. Encased in a grand pink granite sarcophagus, despite its broken lid, it rested in the room's lowest area, a profound symbol of the primordial earth and the origin of all existence, guiding the queen toward eternal life.",

The name  Miyamoto Musashi  was one of several he used throughout his life, but it was not his given name at birth nor the name on his memorial. Scholars believe it is likely that Musashi was adopted, and translator and scholar Alexander Bennett has suggested that, based on accounts of his behavior and relationships, Musashi might today be recognized as being on the autism spectrum. Musashi was best known for founding the School of Two Swords and is considered a kensei ( sword saint ). (Follow in the footsteps of samurai on this ancient trail.) However, like most samurai of the time, Musashi s talents extended far beyond combat. Musashi came of age during the final years of Japan s Warring States period a century of civil conflict that ended with the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603.

        "content": "(Who hid this gold hoard in the English countryside?) The delicate operation continued the following evening with the transport of the work in an effort that involved nearly 90 people and took more than seven hours. Bayeux s mayor told France 3 that law enforcement escorted two trucks from the museum one containing the 1,000-year-old treasure and the other that acted as a decoy. The tapestry was then taken to a secret storage location, according to the AFP , where it will be held before it makes its way to England. Until now, specifics of tapestry's removal from the museum in Bayeux had been scant, and the exact manner in which it will make its way to England remains a closely guarded secret. A spokesperson from the Bayeux Tapestry Museum declined to comment on the logistics of the operation, citing security reasons, and France s Ministry of Culture did not respond to multiple interview requests. Transporting the tapestry to England by plane has reportedly been ruled out partly due to a loss of climate control on the tarmac, and media reports speculate that the tapestry s trip will involve some form of overland transport,  possibly combining road and rail with a shuttle train.  Before Friday, the Bayeux Tapestry had been moved only twice the first time by Napoleon, who had it displayed in Paris in an effort to drum up support for a planned invasion of England, and the second time in the 1940s during the German Occupation. At one point, the Nazis even conspired to steal the artifact in order to advance a claim that the depicted conquerors were Vikings (and hence Germanic) rather than Normans. The Third Reich did succeed in absconding with a small piece of the cloth, which remained hidden in Germany for decades after the war and is due to be returned to France.",

        "content": "Europeans in the Middle Ages were no strangers to diseases and plagues. When suffering from health problems, they did the same as people today: They looked to medicine in the hope for a cure, or at least for the easing of pain. People bought, ingested, or applied items that are still familiar potions, ointments, and pills. The chemistry of such medication, however, was very different, made from natural substances once believed to have curative, even miraculous, properties. These included precious stones (agate was a remedy for eye complaints, while jasper was thought to counter hemorrhoids); mineral waters; products derived from animals or even humans (nails, urine, blood); and, above all, a great variety of plants. A pharmacopoeia called De Materia Medica by the Greek physician Dioscorides was widely circulated both in the medieval West and the Arab and Muslim world. It included botanical descriptions and medicinal applications for hundreds of plants. Certain plants were credited with a wide range of curative properties. According to Dioscorides, the cyclamen plant can be made into a potion and used to treat everything from jaundice and headaches to constipation, chilblains, acne, and alopecia. Spice merchants (e piciers in French, speziali in Italian) had close ties with apothecaries, as some of the spices they traded from the East were believed to have medicinal properties. Cinnamon and anise, for example, were used to prevent bad breath. Lotions, potions, and poultices would sometimes be prepared by itinerant healers who sold their wares in the streets or door-to-door. But there were also dispensaries called apothecaries (from the Greek word meaning  storehouse ), the precursors of modern pharmacies and drugstores. (The gory history of Europeans eating mummies for health) Nature cure A garden in a 15th-century French miniature, British Library. ALBUM Monasteries often had a special garden or herbularius dedicated to cultivating medicinal plants, known in French as simples, a word that entered English usage. The plants were placed in square beds separated by pathways. Monk hospital The origin of these apothecaries is closely linked to convents, monasteries, and abbeys. Monastic foundations often had places where they could offer hospitality to pilgrims and the poor. Since many of those using these houses, called hospitals, were also sick, the monks sought ways to treat their ailments, and so the word  hospital  acquired its modern sense Monks were suited to be physicians. They had access to scientific books in their libraries, such as the treatise by Dioscorides, and many other texts in circulation in medieval Europe and the Muslim world. They also had the physical resources. Based on their knowledge, monks knew which medicinal plants to cultivate in their monastery gardens. In this way, the first pharmacies were established as distinct rooms or spaces. In Camaldoli, east of Florence, in the 11th century, a monk named Romuald founded a community of Benedictine monks who ran a hospital for the poor. The pharmacy at Camaldoli was referenced as early as 1048. Sixteenth-century sources describe the provision of medicinal herbs from the well-stocked botanical garden.",

Their pharmacopoeia, a vibrant mosaic of traditional knowledge, relied heavily on substances believed to possess inherent curative powers. Medications ranged from potions and ointments crafted from precious stones and mineral waters to surprising animal derivatives, but above all, an extensive variety of plants. Influential texts like the Greek physician Dioscorides' *De Materia Medica* guided practitioners, meticulously detailing hundreds of botanical descriptions and their medicinal applications for ailments spanning jaundice, headaches, and skin conditions. Even exotic spices, traded from the East by merchants, found their way into remedies, with cinnamon and anise, for instance, used to combat bad breath.\n\nThese healing concoctions were dispensed by itinerant healers traversing streets and doors, but also within nascent dispensaries known as apothecaries—literally \"storehouses\"—the direct ancestors of modern pharmacies. Monasteries emerged as cornerstones of medieval healthcare. Within their serene walls, monks cultivated dedicated \"herbularius\" or medicinal gardens, tending \"simples\" (medicinal plants) with meticulous care. These monastic foundations, initially offering hospitality to pilgrims and the poor, evolved into \"hospitals\" in the modern sense, driven by the monks' commitment to treating the sick. Armed with access to extensive libraries containing scientific texts like Dioscorides' treatise, and the physical resources of their gardens, monks became adept physicians. They established the first distinct pharmacy rooms, laying the groundwork for organized medical care. A notable example is the 11th-century Camaldoli monastery near Florence, where Benedictine monks operated a hospital and a well-referenced pharmacy, providing essential herbal remedies from their richly stocked botanical garden.",

Spices often sit in transit between grower and grocer for years, losing potency in the process. So Javeri Kadri invested the only money she had about $3,000 from her tax refund to buy the freshest turmeric she could find and bring it to California.  I was hand-packing it in my basement and then selling it on the internet,  she remembers. Thanks to a knack for Instagram marketing and a few key contacts in the food world, the business took off. Today Javeri Kadri s Diaspora Co. offers 41 spices, including black peppercorn and cardamom, and spice blends sourced from India and Sri Lanka. Unlike conventional spice companies, Diaspora deals directly with more than 150 farms, reaching thousands of farmworkers while paying them, on average, four times the commodity price for the organic spices they grow. (Fairtrade International, by comparison, pays just 15 percent above market.) The high-quality product allows the company to charge a premium, which has led to more investment in its farm partners. Javeri Kadri s strategy for coaxing people to pay more has been in part to focus on making the difference in quality and potency undeniable.

Today it can be found in Paris on display at the Louvre Museum. STE PHANE MARE CHELLE/RMN One of the thieves, Cadet Guillot Lordonner, left Paris with the insignia of the Golden Fleece. He removed the French Blue from the setting along with the Co te de Bretagne spinel, a red gemstone carved in the shape of a dragon. Once in London, he tried unsuccessfully to sell the Co te de Bretagne to exiled French monarchists and ended up in debtors  prison. The Co te de Bretagne would rejoin the French Crown Jewels, along with a good portion of the stolen loot, but the French Blue had vanished. (Another French mystery: Who was the \"Man in the Iron Mask?\") Some chroniclers believe that the French Blue didn t go to London with Lordonner. Instead, it arrived much later in a scenario worthy of a political thriller. According to this theory, the revolutionary armies desperately needed a victory around the time Austria and Prussia were threatening to invade France in 1792. Led by the Prussian Duke of Brunswick, an invasion was repelled by the French at Valmy and retreated back over the Rhine on September 20. Revolutionary momentum returned and fervor soared. Sunlight streams through the Apollo Gallery in Paris s Louvre Museum, which showcases France s royal regalia, gems, crowns, and diadems. SYLVAIN SONNET/ALAMY/ACI Skeptics questioned how an experienced and well-equipped Prussian general could be defeated so quickly. They theorized that revolutionary leaders had orchestrated the jewel heist earlier that month in order to bribe the Duke of Brunswick. They would give him the French Blue in return for losing the battle at Valmy. Theorists suspect that years later Brunswick sent the Blue to his daughter, Princess Caroline, in London in 1805.

New Identity In 1812 a blue diamond smaller than the famous French gem passed through the hands of a London dealer named Daniel Eliason. How he acquired it, and to whom he sold it, is a mystery. Eliason showed the stone to the jeweler John Francillon, who made a sketch and described a 45.52-carat  deep blue  diamond  without specks or flaws.  Historians believe it is no coincidence that it reappeared two days after the window for prosecuting crimes committed during the French Revolution expired, perhaps encouraging its owner to sell it.",

In a brazen act during the September 1792 riots engulfing Paris, thieves infiltrated the Royal Storehouse, the Garde-Meuble, over five nights, making off with most of France's glittering Crown Jewels. While magnificent treasures like the Regent diamond — which later adorned Napoleon's swords and now gleams in the Louvre — were eventually recovered, the fate of the legendary French Blue became a captivating mystery.\n\nOne notable thief, Cadet Guillot Lordonner, escaped with the French Blue and the Côte de Bretagne spinel. Though the spinel and much of the stolen loot were recovered after his failed attempt to sell it in London led to debtors' prison, the French Blue remained elusive. An intriguing theory suggests the diamond's disappearance was far more than mere theft, hinting at a high-stakes political thriller. Revolutionary leaders, desperate to secure a victory against invading forces, may have orchestrated the heist to bribe the Prussian Duke of Brunswick with the French Blue, thereby ensuring his retreat from the pivotal Battle of Valmy in 1792 and turning the tide of the revolution. Brunswick allegedly later sent the gem to his daughter in London.\n\nYears later, in 1812, a flawless, deep blue diamond, smaller yet unmistakably similar to the vanished French Blue, resurfaced in London through a dealer. Its convenient appearance, precisely coinciding with the expiration of the statute of limitations for crimes committed during the French Revolution, strongly suggests its owner felt safe to bring it to light. This re-emergence marked the diamond's new, albeit mysterious, identity, hinting at a dramatic journey from royal splendor to clandestine political maneuvering and finally, a quiet reintroduction to the world.",

        "content": "Early one June morning in 1837, a few weeks after her 18th birthday, Princess Victoria was awoken by her mother to greet the Archbishop of Canterbury, who delivered the news that King William IV had just died. Victoria, still in her nightdress, had become queen. That night she wrote in her journal:  Very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what is fit and right than I have.  Victoria s accession marked a significant change. Gone were the old men who had ruled for half a century, replaced by a young queen soon to have her own family. As the future British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli told the House of Commons in a speech in 1861:  She who reigns over us has elected amid all the splendor of empire, to establish her life on the principle of domestic love.  The royal family represented youth, morality, and domesticity now. Changed, too, were the regalia worn by monarchies past. A teenage queen who stood at less than five feet tall needed better-proportioned displays of royal authority. A new coronation ring was made for Victoria, and the shafts of the scepters were altered to enable her to hold them comfortably. The Jewel in the Woman s Crown Among Victoria s magnificent jewels was the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which passed into her possession after the British conquered the Sikh empire in 1849. In this 1856 portrait, the young Victoria wears it as a brooch.

He also presented his wife with jewelry of his own design, such as the sapphire and diamond brooch he gave her before their wedding, and a gold and porcelain set, which included a brooch, earrings, and necklace that recalled the wreath of orange blossoms she wore on their wedding day.

        "title": "The real Arthur Guinness of House of Guinness And What Happened To Him",
        "content": "Since 1759, when the first Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease on St James s Gate Brewery in Dublin, generations of Guinnesses have grown the business, along with a vast fortune and a family legacy based on philanthropy as much as their stout. Ad House of Guinness, a drama now streaming on Netflix, explores a chapter of that fascinating family history in the way that only Peaky Blinders and SAS Rogue Heroes creator Steven Knight can. Starring a riotously charming Anthony Boyle (of Masters of the Air fame) as Arthur Guinness, the eight-part series bills itself as a 19th-century Succession, complete with sibling rivalries, political intrigue and a rebellious spirit   all mixed down with plenty of pints. Who was the real Arthur Guinness? The Arthur Guinness of House of Guinness is not the one who founded the brewery back in 1759. This is his great-grandson, Arthur Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun. He ran the brewery business alongside his brother Edward from 1868 to 1876, as well as sitting in the House of Commons as an MP and giving generously to a host of humanitarian causes. Born on 1 November 1840 in Dublin, Arthur was the eldest son of Elizabeth and Benjamin Lee Guinness, the man responsible for turning the brewery into a truly global giant. Growing up with two brothers, Benjamin and Edward, and a sister, Anne, he received an elite education at Eton and Trinity College Dublin, graduating in 1862.

(Image by Alamy) During its first three generations, Guinness had become the largest brewery in Ireland and a major exporter to Europe, the Americas and parts of Africa. Under the stewardship of Arthur and his youngest brother, Edward Guinness, the brewery continued to thrive; even the temperance movement, which bemoaned the social ills of alcohol, promoted the stout as a preferred alternative to spirits like gin and whiskey. What was Arthur s involvement in the brewery? For Arthur, 1868 would be a life-changing year, beginning with the death of his father. He was elevated to the title of Baronet Guinness of Ashford, which had been created just a year earlier to mark Benjamin Lee s achievements. His father left a fortune of  1.1 million (well over  100 million today) and the Guinness Brewery, the management of which became a partnership between Arthur and the youngest son, Edward. While the middle brother Benjamin and sister Anne received estates and money, they had no say in the business. In the first decade of their ownership, the success of Guinness only expanded, with sales more than doubling from around 350,000 barrels sold in 1868 to almost 779,000 in 1876. In the decades that followed, it would rise to more than a million a year. Was Arthur Guinness a philanthropist? As a major landowner in rural Ireland, Arthur had hundreds of poor tenants. Although more attentive than many landlords, this got him embroiled in the agrarian unrest and occasional violence of the 1880s, known as the Land War, in which several of his employees were murdered. Generally, though, he was considered a generous and conscientious figure, having learned the creed of the Guinness family to favour philanthropy and social responsibility over greed. Did Arthur Guinness commit election fraud? The year 1868 also saw Arthur s election to the UK Parliament as a Conservative MP for the City of Dublin, the seat previously been held by his father. Only a year later, however, the election was voided when it emerged that Guinness agents had used tactics that amounted to corruption and bribery, even offering  5 for every vote. When the matter went to court, it was concluded that Arthur himself had no idea this had happened.

(Image by Ben Blackall/Netflix) It would be another five years before he could win his seat back, in 1874, when he served under the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli until 1880. This was a time of widening divide in Ireland, between the Unionists who wished to stay part of the United Kingdom and nationalists seeking independence. Religion similarly divided the Irish between Protestant and Catholic.  | Who was to blame for the Irish famine? Arthur was a staunch Unionist and Protestant, as all generations of his family had been. In later life, he bought two Unionist newspapers and supported the Irish Unionist Alliance, and the Guinness Brewery s clear stance was cause for some anger among republicans. In 1880, Arthur left the House of Commons as he was raised to the peerage as Baron Ardilaun. What s known about Arthur Guinness s sexuality? In 1871, Arthur married Lady Olivia Charlotte Hedges-White, daughter of the Earl of Bantry. It seemed to be a happy marriage, although childless. The couple became known for their extravagant hospitality, hosting both Queen Victoria and the future George V, and they travelled widely. According to Joe Joyce, author of 2009 The Guinnesses: The Untold Story of Ireland s Most Successful Family, Arthur was  probably gay . Joyce also reported that both Arthur Guinness and the Baroness Ardilaun were content in maintaining the marriage under the agreement that there would be no sexual intercourse. It s a slender claim that the show has taken to heart and run with to riotous conclusions. Certainly, there was no way that same-sex relationships could have been accepted in tandem with success in public life   male homosexuality was legislated against in UK law, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. \"Sodomy (or buggery) were previously a hanging offence in Britain,\" writes Brian Lewis. \"This was modified by the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which replaced capital punishment with minimum sentences of 10 years  imprisonment. The Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 added to the statute book a two-year maximum penalty for 'gross indecency' between men.\" What happened to Arthur Guinness after the events of House of Guinness? In 1876, Arthur made the decision to step back from the brewery, selling his half of the shares to his brother for nearly  700,000. Although that figure made the younger Guinness a fabulously wealthy man, Edward would float the business a few years later on the London Stock Exchange, which made him a multi-millionaire. Arthur helped restore Marsh s Library and extend the Coombe Hospital in Dublin; he  the building of housing for the poor; and, along with his brother, set up the Dublin Exhibition of Arts and Finance to encourage domestic trade. To this day, people can visit St Stephen s Green, a 22-acre public park that Arthur bought, landscaped and gifted to the city in the 1870s and 80s. Was Arthur Guinness assassinated? No, Arthur Guinness was not assassinated, or ever targeted by a Fenian plot to assassinate him. Arthur died on 20 January 1915, at the age of 74. He would be buried in the Dublin suburb of Raheny at All Saints  Church, the building of which he had helped fund several decades earlier. Ad House of Guinness is streaming on Netflix now.

        "title": "Shakespeare s 'lost years': what do we know about this secretive chapter of the bard's life?",
        "content": "The idea that William Shakespeare s life contains a stretch of  lost years  is a minor ghost that haunts popular biographies and discussion of his poems and plays. Those missing years are conventionally taken to begin in February 1585, when Shakespeare s children   twins Judith and Hamnet   were baptised at Stratford upon Avon, and to end in September 1592, when he was described as being  an upstart Crow  in a gossipy pamphlet in London. Ad Between these dates, we have no reliable record that ties Shakespeare to any particular location, or reveals what he was doing. Shakespeare was 20 when his lost years began, and 28 when they ended. Those seven-and-a-half lost years belong in a wider landscape in which we know remarkably little about the playwright. We know virtually nothing for sure about Shakespeare s schooling, which he probably completed in 1578 or so; nor what he did until he married Anne Hathaway in November 1582. Listen on the podcast | What happened in Shakespeare's lost years? This is not only the case for Shakespeare: scholars may hate to admit it, but our ignorance of so much of this period is vast. Almost 60 per cent of the 3,000 different plays written between 1570 and 1642 are lost. While some titles survive, there could be some lost plays that we have never even heard of at all. It is a safe guess, but a guess nonetheless, that plays by Shakespeare are among these wholly lost plays. We are uncertain of even the most basic things. Until the remains of the Elizabethan Curtain playhouse in Shoreditch, London, were discovered in 2012, theatre historians assumed that it was round; it turned out to be rectangular. Why the lost years matter Shakespeare s undocumented years have a special quality: enigmatic, evocative and instructive. As those years began, Shakespeare was a young man in a provincial town who had written nothing and had few prospects. When they ended, he was celebrated enough as a playwright to be worth attacking. The lost years are exactly the period of his genesis as a writer. What has filled those years is a series of guesses and rumours. Half a century after Shakespeare s death, the 17th-century antiquarian John Aubrey began collecting anecdotes and stories about Shakespeare from people who had known him, notably the son of an actor who had been a member of Shakespeare s company. The lost years are exactly the period of his genesis as a writer Aubrey recounts, in his Brief Lives   a collection of short biographies   two slightly different stories about those lost years.  This William being inclined naturally to Poetry and acting,  Aubrey wrote,  came to London I guess about 18 and was an Actor at one of the Play-houses and did act exceedingly well.  Then a little later, he added:  he had been in his younger years a School-master in the Country.  The two stories don t quite fit together: a diligent, rural Shakespeare versus a theatrical, London one. But they establish the two main traditions of thinking about this time. Shakespeare, depicted in a later image based on a contemporary portrait. His dramatic works shed light on Elizabethan and Jacobean society, and on views of history. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) The writer and poet Nicholas Rowe prepared the first real biography of Shakespeare for his own edition of Shakespeare s plays published in 1709. Rowe had apparently not read Aubrey, but he offers an expanded version of the first idea. He repeats a Stratford legend, that the young Shakespeare fell into  ill company  and poached a deer from a local gentleman. The ensuing trouble meant he had to flee to London, where he found work at a playhouse. There, suggests Rowe,  his admirable Wit, and the natural Turn of it to the Stage, soon distinguish d him, if not as an extraordinary actor, yet as an excellent Writer .  | Did someone else write the plays of William Shakespeare? The real history that debunks the conspiracy This is an echo, or revision, of Aubrey s first story. Another version, which circulated in the 17th century, was that the young Shakespeare held the horses at the playhouse door. The alternative and less thespian description of Shakespeare also pops up in the early biographies. Edmond Malone, in his great edition of the plays (1790) and the biographical essay which accompanies it, extended Rowe s biography into a much more reliable timeline of Shakespeare s life and works. This edition is the foundation of much later textual study, and while it is a mountain of scholarship it is not without a little sentimental speculation. In it, Malone speculates that after leaving school, Shakespeare was  employed, while he yet remained at Stratford, in the office of some country attorney . Perhaps so: it is worth noting that Malone himself had trained as a barrister. Along with the development of Shakespeare biography, and the beginnings of careful scholarly work on the texts of the plays, came the realisation that some things were unknown. We might say that the lost years are really a sign of how much has been found; it was only once much was known, with some degree of confidence, that the idea of  lost years  emerged. In a further apparent paradox, in the early 20th century the phrase itself became less an admission of ignorance than a boast about knowledge. Player, teacher, clerk? Those keenest to use the phrase have been those most sure they have the answer. Arthur Acheson s 1920 book Shakespeare s Lost Years in London, 1586-1592 confidently uses the phrase  lost years    and sometimes  dark years    to refer to this specific period, but only to find them to be not so lost at all. His book discovers Shakespeare, as in Rowe, arriving early in London. E A J Honigmann s 1985 book Shakespeare: The  Lost Years  places him back in the countryside: in Lancashire, working in the household of a Catholic family in Lancashire, perhaps as a player (actor), or a tutor. In each case, that  lost  is rhetorical. There is no evidence that he was not, say, a pirate or a mercenary in those years Shakespeare the player, the teacher, the clerk: the timidity of the suggestions is revealing. There is no evidence that he was not, say, a pirate or a mercenary in those years. But what he wasn t tells us much about him. Shakespeare was not at university, while so many of his contemporary playwrights were. He was not a spy, while his great rival Christopher Marlowe was, in the same period of his life. The lost years mark him as apart and this is why they matter both as an episode and a story. They say: here is a mystery. Your attempt to solve it may reveal something only about you. Shakespeare got there first, of course. In the middle of his play The Winter s Tale, a character called Time enters, and addresses the audience: Impute it not a crime To me, or my swift passage, that I slide O er sixteen years, and leave the growth untried Of that wide gap. Between the first and second halves of the play, 16 years have disappeared, and Time offers an apology that soon turns into a boast: Of that wide gap, since it is in my power To o er throw law, and in one self-born hour To plant and o erwhelm custom. The lost years are Shakespeare s self-born hour. In them, he exits the world of conventional, discoverable biography, and enters the world of the theatre, of play and invention.

        "target_summary": "A persistent phantom in Shakespearean biography, the concept of his \"lost years\" describes a seven-and-a-half-year silence in the historical record, stretching from his children's baptism in Stratford in February 1585, when he was 20, to his emergence as a celebrated \"upstart Crow\" playwright in London by September 1592. This enigmatic period reveals no reliable trace of his whereabouts or activities, casting a profound shadow over his early adulthood. Yet, these silent years are far from insignificant. They possess a special, almost mystical, quality: enigmatic, evocative, and profoundly instructive. They mark Shakespeare's metamorphosis from a young man of scant prospects in a provincial town, who had penned nothing of note, into a burgeoning playwright celebrated enough to provoke fierce rivalry. This crucial interval represents nothing less than his genesis as a writer.\n\nThe absence of definitive documentation for Shakespeare's early life is not unique, as much of the Elizabethan theatrical world remains shrouded in mystery, with countless plays and even the designs of playhouses lost to time. However, the \"lost years\" hold a particular fascination, prompting centuries of biographers to fill the void with a tapestry of legend and reasoned conjecture.\n\nThe earliest glimpses into this lacuna come from John Aubrey in the 17th century, who relayed conflicting anecdotes: one of Shakespeare as a London actor, another as a rural schoolmaster. Nicholas Rowe, in his 1709 biography, expanded upon the former, adding a Stratford legend of deer poaching forcing the young playwright's flight to London, where his \"admirable Wit\" quickly distinguished him. Later, Edmond Malone speculated about Shakespeare potentially working as a country attorney.\n\nParadoxically, as scholarship advanced, the phrase \"lost years\" transformed from an admission of ignorance into a rhetorical boast, with subsequent biographers confidently claiming to have \"found\" Shakespeare during this time—whether in London or in the Lancashire countryside as a player or tutor. The timidity of these suggestions (player, teacher, clerk) is revealing, contrasting starkly with the more dramatic lives of contemporaries like Christopher Marlowe, a known spy, or university-educated playwrights. These choices underscore Shakespeare's distinct path, marking him as apart from his peers.\n\nUltimately, these \"lost years\" transcend mere biographical gaps; they represent Shakespeare's own \"self-born hour,\" echoing the character of Time in *The Winter's Tale*, who effortlessly \"slides o'er sixteen years.\" This period allowed Shakespeare to exit the conventional, discoverable world of biography and fully immerse himself in the transformative realm of theatre, play, and invention. The enduring mystery of these years continues to invite speculation, often revealing more about the inquirer than about Shakespeare himself.",

        "title": "The ingenious Roman invention that sparked the ancient empire s obsession with luxury",
        "content": "Think of Roman engineering, and it might be the grandest feats that first come to mind: the towering aqueducts bringing water to towns and cities, the amphitheatres filled with cheering crowds, and the paved roads that stitched the Roman empire together. Ad The hypocaust   the Roman system of underfloor heating   may be less staggering in its scale, but it remains one of the most recognisable features of Roman domestic life. Archaeologists still point to those distinctive stacks of bricks beneath villa floors as a mark of Roman sophistication.  The hypocaust system is really important for us to think about when we consider Roman homes,  explains Dr Hannah Platts on the HistoryExtra podcast.  It was important to them: that it heated their baths and their other spaces.  But they weren t for everyone. Who owned homes with underfloor heating? And what did such comfort say about status and power?  I should reiterate, having your own bathhouse or having a hypocaust was a luxury,  says Platts. Rome s underfloor miracle At its simplest, a hypocaust worked by circulating hot air through a hollow space beneath the floor. A furnace, or praefurnium, was stoked outside the building; hot air from the furnace was funnelled into a network of small brick pillars (pilae) that supported a raised floor. But it wasn t just about heating the floor.  | How and why did the Roman empire fall?  The hypocaust was used to heat houses via underfloor heating, but actually we ve got a number of houses where we ve got evidence of box flue tiles in the walls,  says Platts.  So we know that hypocausts could heat the walls of the rooms as well.  In the context of ancient Rome this was engineering of incredible sophistication. Archaeological remains from sites such as Pompeii and Ostia, and across Roman Britain, show entire suites of rooms heated by the system. Stepping barefoot on a mosaic floor, warmed from underneath, was quite literally to step upon Roman ingenuity. The Roman baths at Salamis, dating to the 3rd century, feature a well-preserved hypocaust system beneath the tepidarium, or warm room. This network of brick pillars once channelled hot air under and through the floors. (Photo by Getty Images) From the baths to the villa The hypocaust began as a public luxury, eventually exported to private homes. The earliest examples appeared in the great bath complexes (thermae) of the late republic and early empire. Roman baths were vast public leisure centres and required consistent, large-scale heating. The first recorded Roman hypocausts date to the first century BC, developed under architects and engineers serving figures such as Marcus Agrippa, the ally and later son-in-law of the Roman emperor Augustus. Under Augustus himself, public bathhouses multiplied across Rome and its provinces. The technique soon spread to private villas, where the wealthy adapted public comfort for domestic display. By the second century AD, during the reigns of emperors such as Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, the hypocaust had become a standard feature of elite architecture across the empire   from the Mediterranean heartlands to the frontier forts of Britain. The price of luxury But this warmth came at a cost.  We know that the idea of heating your house was really important, but it wasn t for everyone,  says Platts.  To have a hypocaust system in one s house was a big sign of wealth. It would generally only have been present in examples of really opulent and wealthy dwellings: dwellings that, for example, might have their own private bathhouses.  They didn t even need to go to the general baths. They could just have fun in their own spaces.  And, Platts says, what often goes forgotten is that maintaining heat from a hypocaust was hard.  | Everything you wanted to know about the Roman emperors  It took significant effort to build [and] to maintain,  says Platts. Fires had to be constantly fed with wood, ash cleared away and airways cleaned.  There s engineering skill behind it too,  says Platts.  Not everyone is going to be able to build a hypocaust. There is a huge amount of skill behind that building process, and then you ve actually got to be able to run the hypocaust and have it working. It really would ve taken considerable finances to build a hypocaust within your house.  The result was that the hypocaust became an unmistakable badge of wealth. Visitors entering a villa with warm floors knew instantly that they stood in the home of someone of status. This Roman mosaic from Sousse, Tunisia, shows the poet Virgil seated between the muses Clio and Melpomene as he writes the Aeneid. (Photo by Getty Images) The Roman world of privilege and luxury The hypocaust was one element within the broader picture of Roman luxury. For the upper classes, architecture, fashion, and food all worked together to display wealth and taste.  What also would be luxuries could be the way in which people spent their fortunes in other ways,  Platts says.  I m thinking about fashionable clothing, or elaborate jewellery or gemstones. Romans loved amber. They loved pearls. They had quite a thing for uncut diamonds   as we all might   and things that were imported: ivory imported from Africa, silks imported from towards China.  The global reach of the Roman empire fed its appetite for exotic goods. To own these luxuries, to eat peppered dishes and dress in silk, was to embody the luxuries of empire.  Anything like fine wines, exotic spices, was a really good way of showing your status,  Platts notes. In this way, food became another way to demonstrate power. Enslaved servants circulated trays of imported delicacies from Britain, Syria and Africa, served to guests in rooms warmed by the hypocaust. Living symbols of servitude Luxury in Rome was also inseparable from labour, says Platts.  Whilst owning a slave in and of itself was not a luxury   Rome was a slave-based economy, and actually, even many of the really relatively poor households would likely have one or two enslaved people living under their roofs   the number of slaves you had, where they came from, and how skilled they were, that really was a sign of wealth and luxury.  For the Roman elites, warm homes   and the people who kept them running   were signs of sophistication and wealth combined. The hypocaust might not have been as spectacular as an aqueduct or as imposing as an amphitheatre, but it does symbolise a crucial fact of ethos of the Roman empire: it shows how innovative engineering served comfort for the wealthy as much as conquest on the frontiers. Ad Hannah Platts was speaking to Emily Briffett on the HistoryExtra podcast. Listen to the full conversation.",
        "target_summary": "While Roman engineering often evokes images of monumental aqueducts and grand amphitheatres, the **hypocaust**—an innovative underfloor heating system—reveals a more intimate yet equally sophisticated aspect of Roman life. These distinctive networks of brick pillars beneath floors stand as archaeological testaments to Roman ingenuity and domestic luxury.\n\nAt its core, the hypocaust was a marvel of ancient engineering. Furnaces, stoked externally, channeled scorching hot air through hollow spaces formed by **pilae** (small brick pillars) supporting a raised floor. This ingenious design not only warmed mosaic floors, inviting occupants to step barefoot on a tangible display of Roman cleverness, but also extended its comforting heat to walls via intricate box flue tiles, creating entire suites of cozily warmed rooms.\n\nBeginning as a public luxury in the sprawling **thermae** (bath complexes) of the late Republic and early Empire, the hypocaust eventually migrated to private residences. By the 2nd century AD, it became a coveted standard feature in elite villas across the vast Roman Empire, from its Mediterranean heartlands to the frontier forts of Britain, transforming public comfort into a private display of affluence.\n\nYet, this lavish warmth carried a significant price tag, cementing the hypocaust's status as a profound badge of wealth. As Dr. Hannah Platts explains, its construction demanded considerable financial outlay and specialized engineering skill. Moreover, maintaining such a system was an arduous, continuous task, requiring constant feeding of furnaces, clearing of ash, and meticulous upkeep of airways. Thus, only the most opulent households, often boasting their own private bathhouses, could sustain such a costly amenity.\n\nThe hypocaust was but one thread in the rich tapestry of Roman aristocratic luxury, where every element—from architecture to fashion and cuisine—served to proclaim wealth and refined taste. Elite Romans adorned themselves with silks, elaborate jewelry, and precious imported goods like ivory, amber, and exotic spices, demonstrating their global reach and status. Crucially, this privileged existence, including the steady warmth of their homes, was inextricably linked to **enslaved labor**. While slavery was widespread, the quantity, origin, and specialized skills of one's enslaved household significantly amplified one's social standing and capacity for luxury.\n\nIn essence, the hypocaust, though less colossal than its architectural cousins, powerfully symbolizes the Roman Empire's dual genius: harnessing groundbreaking engineering not only for conquest and public works but also for cultivating an exclusive realm of comfort and opulent display for its privileged elite.",

        "content": "Roman society was acutely hierarchical. Every occupation carried a moral weight, and the line between dignity and dishonour was a stark one. A senator who spoke in the law courts could win eternal repute, but a gladiator who risked his life to entertain the masses was branded socially devalued, and the same was true of actors. Ad No matter how dazzling their performances in front of a packed theatre might be, their profession consigned them to the lowest rungs of society. By law they were infamis; people of ill repute, stripped of civic rights and grouped alongside the enslaved. But what was this paradoxical life of stardom and shame really like for the actors of the Roman empire? Roman theatre s golden age under Augustus  When we talk about a golden age of Roman theatre, we tend to be talking about Emperor Augustus s reign and the beginning of the Roman empire,  says Jessica Clarke, author of A New History of Ancient Roman Theatre, speaking on the HistoryExtra podcast.  This was a period with new cultural, religious and political structures being implemented.  Augustus was the first emperor of Rome, ruling from 27 BC until AD 14. And he grasped how useful theatre could be as a political tool.  | The worst Roman emperors Spectacle was part of a strategy that Romans would come to call panem et circenses, or bread and circuses: free food and entertainment offered to the populace in return for loyalty and social cohesion. Drama and performance helped bind audiences into a shared Roman identity and provided a stage (quite literally) for imperial ideology. This 1st-century AD mosaic from the House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii depicts the staging of a theatrical performance. Such scenes highlight the importance of theatre in Roman cultural life, blending entertainment with expressions of myth, satire, and social commentary. (Photo by Getty Images) A web of theatres across the Roman empire  Augustus built hundreds of theatres across the Roman empire, all following the design of the theatre that he also built for himself in Rome,  Clarke explains.  These theatres are enormous, they re spread across all of the provinces. Essentially, what he built was a web of entertainment venues that Rome was in charge of.  These theatres were architectural marvels in themselves. The Theatre of Marcellus in Rome, inaugurated by Augustus in 13 BC and named after his nephew, could seat more than 10,000 people. Its semicircular rows of stone seating rose above a wide orchestra space and a stage backed by the towering scaenae frons; a richly decorated permanent backdrop of columns, niches and statues. Men and women alike could attend the performances at this new wave of theatres, (unlike in Greece, where women were mostly banned from attending) and seating was arranged by social rank, with senators and equestrians   members of the second-highest social class   in prime positions, and the poor higher up. Performances ranged from solemn tragedies to ribald comedies, farcical mimes and elaborate pantomimes accompanied by music and dance. Admission was usually free, funded by magistrates or emperors seeking popularity. Who performed and who was excluded The Roman stage, however, was overwhelmingly male. As in Greece, women were largely banned from treading the boards. Clarke points to the existence of scant evidence of female performers in mime and pantomime   forms considered lower status and more risqu    but official theatre roles were reserved for men.  It s quite similar to Shakespearean rules around who is allowed to step onto a stage,  says Clarke.  Though it would have been slightly easier for men to play the female roles because they had masks on.  Masks, made of linen and plaster or occasionally wood, were central to performance, and not just because they made it easier for men to portray women; they exaggerated expressions and amplified voices too. Caesar: Death of a Dictator Member exclusive | On the Ides of March 44 BC, the most famous Roman in history was murdered.

Listen to all episodes now On the Ides of March 44 BC, the most famous Roman in history was murdered. Julius Caesar's assassination transformed Rome forever, and the image of his bloody toga has haunted monarchs and tyrants ever since. Actors as infamis No amount of training or talent could lift an actor out of the social stigma that came with the role.  In ancient Rome, acting was an incredibly lowly profession,  says Clarke.  It wasn t something that was seen as an acceptable job for a Roman citizen to undertake. An actor was in the class known as infamis.  This was the same class as a slave; the same class as a prostitute. You would have no voting rights, and you also don t have bodily autonomy, so you don t have legal rights over your body,  Clarke explains. Why this disdain? Roman moralists believed that a respectable citizen should preserve dignitas (dignity) and gravitas (seriousness). To display one s body on stage, to impersonate others, or to provoke laughter was considered undignified. The actor sold their body and voice for public pleasure, which made the profession inherently shameful. This attitude was consistent with how Roman society viewed other entertainers. Gladiators might achieve celebrity in the arena, and charioteers could command passionate fan followings, but both were technically degraded in status. Performers were celebrated in spectacle but lacked any standing in civic life. The life of a Roman actor Evidence from inscriptions, satirical writings and contracts paints a picture of precariousness. Troupes travelled from town to town, dependent on festivals and civic sponsorship for work, while pay was unreliable; some actors received generous gifts, others little more than food and board. The constant would have been the rehearsals. Actors trained their voices to carry across open-air theatres, practised precise gestures codified to signal emotions and maintained the masks, costumes and props essential for performance. Injuries would have been common, especially in physical pantomimes involving acrobatics.  | The overshadowed ancient empire that rivalled Rome with maritime might and an iron fist  But that doesn t mean that we don t know about some very famous actors,  says Clarke.  One we know of is called Clodius Aesopus. He was the most famous tragic actor in the late Republic. Cicero was friends with him.  Aesopus, active in the first century BC, was celebrated for bringing Greek classics to Roman audiences. As Clarke notes, he became a personal acquaintance of Marcus Tullius Cicero, one of Rome s greatest statesmen, orators and philosophers, whose speeches still survive as masterpieces of Latin prose. That such a figure could publicly befriend an actor underscores the inherent paradox: Aesopus was admired, wealthy and socially connected, yet in law he remained infamis. Life as a Roman actor was full of strange contradictions. The art form of theatre was a powerful political tool, theatres themselves were magnificent constructions, audiences were vast and enthusiastic, and some performers became famous enough to mingle with Rome s elite. Yet the profession itself stripped actors of rights and respect. It was a life lived in the spotlight, but without dignity. Ad Jessica Clarke was speaking to Emily Briffett on the HistoryExtra podcast. Listen to the full conversation.",
        "target_summary": "Roman society was acutely hierarchical, placing public performers like actors and gladiators at its lowest rungs, branding them \"infamis\" – people of ill repute. Despite their ability to captivate vast audiences, actors were stripped of civic rights, lacked bodily autonomy, and were legally grouped with enslaved individuals and prostitutes. This profound societal disdain stemmed from a Roman value system that highly prized \"dignitas\" (dignity) and \"gravitas\" (seriousness), deeming the public display of one's body or the impersonation of others as inherently undignified and shameful.\n\nParadoxically, this era of social degradation also marked a golden age for Roman theatre, particularly under Emperor Augustus's reign (27 BC - AD 14). Augustus masterfully utilized theatre as a potent political instrument, integrating spectacles into his \"panem et circenses\" (bread and circuses) strategy to foster loyalty, ensure social cohesion, and subtly propagate imperial ideology. To support this grand vision, he oversaw the construction of a vast network of magnificent theatres across the empire, echoing the colossal design of his own theatre in Rome. These architectural marvels, such as the Theatre of Marcellus which accommodated over 10,000 spectators, boasted elaborate backdrops and welcomed both men and women, albeit with seating rigidly segregated by social rank. Performances encompassed a rich variety, from solemn tragedies and farcical mimes to elaborate pantomimes, often offered free to the public.\n\nThe stage, however, was overwhelmingly male. Actors, predominantly men, relied on linen, plaster, or wooden masks not only to amplify their voices and exaggerate expressions but also to portray female roles, with only scant evidence of women performing in lower-status forms like mime. An actor's life was demanding and precarious; troupes constantly travelled, relying on festivals and civic sponsorship, and pay was notoriously unreliable. Rigorous training in voice projection, codified gestures, and meticulous maintenance of masks and costumes were essential, and physical injuries were common.\n\nYet, amidst this legal disenfranchisement, a fascinating contradiction emerged: some actors achieved immense celebrity and wealth. Notable figures like Clodius Aesopus, a celebrated tragic actor of the late Republic, were so admired that they forged personal acquaintances with Rome's elite, including the esteemed statesman Cicero. Thus, the Roman actor navigated a life of profound paradox: a publicly celebrated figure whose art served as a powerful political tool, performing in grand venues before enthusiastic crowds, yet simultaneously branded \"infamis,\" legally dispossessed, and denied fundamental dignity. Their existence was one brilliantly illuminated by the spotlight, yet perpetually shadowed by deep societal shame.",

        "title": "The Strange Christian Afterlife of Pontius Pilate",
        "content": "Towards the end of the second century AD the pagan intellectual Celsus wrote an anti-Christian treatise mocking belief in Jesus Christ. If Jesus really had been the Son of God, he asked, why hadn t God punished Pontius Pilate, the man responsible for crucifying him? Why had Pilate not been driven insane or torn apart, like the characters in Greek myths? Why had no calamity befallen him? While there are plenty of later Christian traditions about the punishment of Pontius Pilate, all of these seem to belong to a period long after Celsus was writing. Celsus  challenge, and the response of early Christians to it, suggests that there was more than a kernel of truth in the claim that the Prefect of Judaea had evaded misfortune. This is implicit from the efforts early Christians made to absolve him of responsibility for the Crucifixion. The only reliable statement we have about Pilate s life after his time in Judaea comes from the pen of the Jewish writer Josephus. In his Antiquities of the Jews, written about 60 years after the events, Josephus states that Pilate was recalled to Rome after his mishandling of a riot involving the Samaritans in AD 36. For this he would have expected to face a hearing before the Emperor Tiberius, the aged but uncompromising ruler who had appointed him ten years earlier. Pilate hurried back, but by the time he arrived, in March AD 37, the ailing Tiberius had died. A new emperor, Caligula, had taken up the reins of power. What happened next is guesswork. Josephus says nothing more about him, implying that there was no hearing. Perhaps, in the general euphoria surrounding Caligula s accession, his case was put on hold, or simply forgotten. Maybe the hearing did go ahead and he was acquitted. For all we know, he was given another posting. The lack of a suitably grisly fate for Pilate put Christian apologists in a quandary. As governor, it was Pilate s job to pass judgement in capital cases: he was the one who condemned Jesus to suffer on the cross. There was no circumventing his guilt. Divine punishment should have followed. Yet in the early years of Christianity it was difficult to make such claims. The Roman state was suspicious of the new cult and, if Christians wanted to avoid confrontation, it was best not to accuse one of Rome s officials of deicide. The canonical Gospels stressed that Pilate was not fully to blame. He could find no fault in Jesus:  I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him , Pilate declares in Luke s Gospel. John has Pilate twice announce  I find no basis for a charge against him . The apocryphal Gospel of Peter, thought by many scholars to be among the earliest Christian texts, went even further. In this, Pilate and his soldiers play no part in the crowd s mocking or torturing of Jesus. He himself declares  I am pure from the blood of the Son of God  and, together with his soldiers, who guard the tomb of Jesus, he conspires to keep the miracle of the Resurrection secret from the Jewish priests. The tradition of a blameless Pilate, a witness to the Passion, led to a strange early Christian fascination with him. By the second century AD, fake letters of Pilate, recounting the wondrous story of Jesus, circulated among the faithful. The so-called Acts of Pilate, allegedly deriving from the governor s own records, portray Pilate as a convert. Tertullian, the late second-century Christian theologian, described Pilate as someone  who himself also in his own conscience was now a Christian  and alleged that Tiberius was so convinced by Pilate s reports that he would have placed Jesus among the Roman gods had not the Senate refused. So influential were the various versions of the Acts of Pilate that in the early fourth century the Roman state created and promoted an anti-Christian,  true , pagan version in an attempt to discredit the Christian ones. Needless to say this was no more reliable than its rivals. All of this might seem merely capricious, but the absolution of Pilate came at a terrible cost. The early Christians shifted the blame for the Crucifixion onto others. A rebuttal of the arguments of Celsus, written by the third-century bishop Origen, shows this clearly:  It was not so much Pilate that condemned Him,  he wrote,  as the Jewish nation . Celsus had chosen the wrong culprit; and the fact that the Jewish nation had been torn apart by the Romans and dispersed across the face of the earth was proof of God s retribution. The fake letters and the Christian versions of the Acts of Pilate said much the same thing, as did other Christian apologists. The Acts went so far as to have the Jewish crowd telling Pilate that they willingly accept the blood-guilt, an echo of the Gospel of Matthew, which has the same crowd shouting  his blood be on us and our children!  These claims formed a basis for Christian persecution of the Jews right up to modern times. Pilate s costly absolution was the product of specific religious and political circumstances. When the Roman Empire became a Christian state in the fourth century, there was no longer any need to emphasise his innocence. The Nicene Creed, formulated under Emperor Constantine in AD 325 and emended in AD 381, stated bluntly that Christ  was crucified under Pontius Pilate . It became acceptable to cast Pilate as a villain and a range of myths developed describing his grisly end. Some influential Christians demurred, however. Saint Augustine, writing in the sixth century, argued that when Pilate wrote on the cross  Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews , he really meant it:  It could not be torn from his heart that Jesus was the King of the Jews.  While the West went on to develop the tradition of a  bad  Pilate who was punished for his misdeeds, the Eastern Church preferred a more sympathetic interpretation. Not only was Pilate a Christian; he was a confessor and even a martyr. One eastern text, The Handing Over of Pilate, has Tiberius ordering the governor to be beheaded for having allowed the Crucifixion to go ahead. First Pilate repents and then a voice from heaven proclaims that all nations will bless him, because under his governorship the prophecies about Christ were fulfilled. Finally an angel takes charge of his severed head. In some accounts he is buried with his wife and two children next to the tomb of Jesus   the ultimate martyr s sepulchre. In the Gospel of Matthew, Pilate s wife warns her husband not to harm Jesus and for this she achieved sainthood among Orthodox Christians. The Copts and Christians of Ethiopia took the next step and canonised Pilate himself. An Ethiopian collection of hagiographies lists St Pilate s Day as the 25th of the summer month of Sanne, a day shared with his wife Procla and the saints Jude, Peter and Paul: Salutation to Pilate, who washed his hands To show he himself was innocent of the blood of Jesus Christ Those familiar with the western tradition may find the idea of St Pontius Pilate curious or even absurd. But the fascination with Pilate never abates. From the Acts of Pilate to Mikhail Bulgakov s novel The Master and Margerita, the man who cross-examined and crucified Jesus remains an enigma, a shadowy metaphor for opposites: equivocation and stubbornness, cowardice and heroism, cruelty and clemency. His dilemma   to do the right thing or the popular thing   is every ruler s quandary. Perhaps that is why people can sympathise with him: we too must sometimes face a difficult choice; though, fortunately for us, its legacy is likely to be less enduring.

        "target_summary": "The enigmatic figure of Pontius Pilate has long provoked divergent interpretations, stemming from a crucial challenge posed in the late second century AD by the pagan intellectual Celsus. He critically observed that Pilate, the Roman governor responsible for Jesus's crucifixion, appeared to have evaded any divine punishment, unlike those who offended the gods in classical myths. This lack of a calamitous fate for Pilate posed a significant quandary for early Christians, especially since historical accounts, such as Josephus's *Antiquities of the Jews*, merely state that Pilate was recalled to Rome in AD 36 for misgovernance and his ultimate fate beyond that is unknown, suggesting no dramatic downfall.\n\nTo navigate this dilemma, early Christian apologists sought to absolve Pilate, a politically prudent move given the Roman state's suspicion of the new cult. Canonical Gospels, particularly Luke and John, subtly began to distance Pilate from full culpability, depicting him as finding no fault in Jesus and attempting to release him. Apocryphal texts, such as the *Gospel of Peter*, went even further, entirely exonerating Pilate and his soldiers, portraying him as a witness to the Passion, even conspiring to conceal the Resurrection miracle. This burgeoning tradition of a blameless, even sympathetic, Pilate led to a peculiar early Christian fascination. Spurious \"Acts of Pilate\" circulated, depicting him as a convert or even a secret Christian, a view endorsed by theologians like Tertullian, who believed Pilate was \"Christian in his own conscience.\" So influential were these narratives that the Roman state itself countered with its own \"true\" pagan versions to discredit them.\n\nHowever, Pilate's absolution came at a terrible cost. To deflect blame, early Christians, exemplified by Bishop Origen, tragically shifted responsibility for the crucifixion onto \"the Jewish nation.\" This dangerous narrative, echoing sentiments in Matthew's Gospel where the crowd accepts \"his blood be on us and our children,\" became a foundation for centuries of anti-Jewish persecution.\n\nWith the Roman Empire's eventual embrace of Christianity in the fourth century, the imperative to exonerate Pilate waned. The Nicene Creed bluntly stated Christ \"was crucified under Pontius Pilate,\" allowing for a divergence in his portrayal. The Western Church largely embraced a \"bad\" Pilate, deserving of punishment for his role. Conversely, the Eastern Church cultivated a far more sympathetic view, regarding Pilate as a confessor, even a martyr. Texts like *The Handing Over of Pilate* depict his repentance, a heavenly blessing, and even an angelic burial. His wife, Procla, achieved sainthood for her warning to him, and remarkably, the Coptic and Ethiopian Churches canonized Pilate himself, celebrating his feast day alongside other saints.\n\nUltimately, Pontius Pilate endures as a compelling, ambiguous figure, transcending historical fact to become a powerful metaphor for fundamental human struggles. His dilemma—to pursue justice or appease the masses—resonates as a universal quandary of leadership, embodying the tension between cowardice and courage, cruelty and clemency. This enduring fascination ensures that the man who presided over one of history's pivotal events remains an enigma, prompting ongoing reflection on moral choice and its lasting legacy.",

        "title": "Whose Authority?",
        "content": "How did the idea of a European secular society come about? In this startlingly original book, David Lloyd Dusenbury argues that the separation of politics and religion, of  church and state , can be attributed to a thread of Christian thought rooted in the Gospel accounts of the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate and in subsequent discourses over whether or not Pilate could be held guilty of having ordered  the death of God . This is not a book about Pontius Pilate, nor is it a book about what actually happened in the trial of Jesus. Both topics were of great interest to early Christian apologists, their pagan critics and a parade of later thinkers; and it is these rich intellectual traditions that the book exploits to make its case. Who condemned Jesus, and why, and did they have the right to do so? We encounter a patchwork of competing claims: for example, that Pilate refused to condemn Jesus; or that he condemned him, but believed him innocent; or that he condemned him as a criminal. The Christian accommodation of the tradition that Pilate was guilty in one sense, but innocent in another, is the one that informs the main thrust of the book s argument. Pilate was doing his duty as the representative of a secular power, but did not understand that Jesus was Christ: he was thus, through ignorance, innocent of the charge of deicide, but he nonetheless ordered Jesus  execution. Central to the thesis is the statement Jesus makes before Pilate in the Gospel of John (18:36):  My kingdom is not of this world.  References to Jesus  renunciation of worldly kingdoms can also be found in other parts of the New Testament. The book argues that his refusal to claim this dominion, or to save himself from crucifixion (even though his divine power could have enabled it) had important political consequences in the late antique Mediterranean and medieval Europe. St Augustine s reading of the trial in John emerges as a kind of early manifesto for the division of the sacred realm from what we would call the  secular . For Augustine, Jesus  accusers and Pilate are innocent because they act in ignorance ( they know not what they do , Luke 23:34), but when Pilate sentences Jesus, he does so according to the justice of the saeculum (i.e. the temporal realm, as opposed to the eternal). As the representative of temporal power, Pilate fulfilled his legal responsibility: this is his  innocence . The justice of the saeculum is a form of justice, but imperfect compared to the justice of an all-knowing God.  Truth is not subject to human empire , as the 17th-century legal theorist Samuel Pufendorf has it. From this partition of power and justice, between an imperfect worldly realm based on coercion and an eternal one based on the persuasive power of Christian religious truth, arises the idea of the secular. This twofold partition of prerogatives had a practical aim: it helped the church to maintain its authority while avoiding conflict with political leaders who had military (coercive) power. After the conversion of Constantine to Christianity, church leaders strove to find a way to accommodate Roman imperial power without surrendering to it. Pope Gelasius I (492-96), who, like Augustine, hailed from north Africa, distinguished sacred from secular rule, reassuring the emperor Anastasius that the papacy had no interest in controlling the temporal realm. Yet six centuries later the papacy seemed to renege on this separation and persisted in its claim to worldly authority through medieval times. For critics like the scholar and priest Lorenzo Valla, who exposed as a forgery the Donation of Constantine, a central  ancient  document used to support papal claims to earthly dominion, Jesus  claim in John 18:36 was crucial counter-evidence. So too was it for Dante and Marsilius of Padua, who used Jesus  renunciation to critique the papacy s  perverse desire for government . Rather than arguing for theocracy, these Christian intellectuals used the trial of Jesus to advance the cause of secular authority. By tracing these lines of thought, the book argues that the New Testament contains statements that seem to define a sphere of authority that we would recognise as  secular . Secular rule was certainly not a common feature of ancient states, where politics and religion   what Dusenbury calls a  temple-state    were normally indivisible, and while the word  secular  would not gain its modern sense for more than 1,000 years, the use by early Christians of the concept of the  saeculum  as a legitimate temporal realm separate from the eternal kingdom of God would seem to mark something revolutionary. The powerful image of Jesus renouncing any claim to rule in  this world  helps to explain why some writers that we would normally associate with the secular, such as Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, emerge as inordinately interested in the Pilate trial. These deliberations might seem very far from our own experiences of secularity. Like democracy, we tend to take it for granted as a natural state of affairs. The paradox, according to this book, is that the secular is in large part the offspring of theological argument and, without Jesus  confession before Pontius Pilate, we cannot know how our notions of secularity and tolerance might have developed.

        "target_summary": "In *The Innocence of Pontius Pilate*, David Lloyd Dusenbury offers a startlingly original argument that the very concept of a European secular society, marked by the separation of politics and religion, finds its roots in a specific thread of Christian thought. The book meticulously traces this lineage back to the Gospel accounts of Jesus's trial before Pontius Pilate, and the subsequent, centuries-long theological debates over Pilate's culpability in ordering \"the death of God.\"\n\nDusenbury delves not into the historical facts of the trial itself, but rather explores the rich intellectual traditions that grappled with questions of who condemned Jesus, and on what grounds. Central to his thesis is the nuanced understanding of Pilate's 'innocence': he acted as a representative of secular power, fulfilling his temporal duty by ordering the execution, yet was simultaneously ignorant of Jesus's divine nature, thus innocent of deicide. This pivotal distinction is illuminated by Jesus's profound declaration in John 18:36: \"My kingdom is not of this world.\" This renunciation of earthly dominion, the book argues, had significant political ramifications throughout late antiquity and the medieval period.\n\nSt. Augustine's influential reading of the trial emerges as an early \"manifesto\" for dividing the sacred from the *saeculum*, or the temporal realm. For Augustine, Pilate's justice, though imperfect compared to God's, represented a legitimate worldly authority. This conceptual partition, establishing a realm of imperfect, coercive human law alongside an eternal one based on persuasive religious truth, fundamentally gave rise to the idea of the secular.\n\nPractically, this division allowed the Church to assert its spiritual authority without directly challenging temporal rulers. While early figures like Pope Gelasius I championed this separation, later papal claims to worldly power throughout the Middle Ages prompted fierce critique. Christian intellectuals such as Lorenzo Valla, Dante, and Marsilius of Padua, far from advocating theocracy, wielded Jesus's renunciation of earthly power to argue for distinct secular authority, thereby challenging the papacy's temporal ambitions.\n\nThe book contends that the early Christian adoption of the *saeculum* as a legitimate, separate sphere from God's eternal kingdom was revolutionary in a world of \"temple-states\" where politics and religion were indivisible. Dusenbury reveals the profound paradox that our modern, often taken-for-granted notions of secularity and tolerance are, in large part, the unexpected offspring of complex theological arguments, inextricably linked to Jesus's confession before Pontius Pilate.",

        "title": "Disputing Disaster  by Perry Anderson review",
        "content": "Disputing Disaster is a book about the First World War s origins and causes, not   as its title suggests   the war itself. It discusses six historians who have written on a century-old debate that has swung from an acceptance of German war guilt (as stated in the Paris Peace Agreement in 1919) to sharing responsibility among all the players. Today the scholarly needle, as in the early 1930s, points more to the latter conclusion than the former. Perry Anderson s own position prioritises the systemic origins over the proximate and contingent causes of the July 1914 crisis. He aligns the war s outbreak with the collapse of the Concert of Europe   confirmed by Austria-Hungary s decision to abandon a system which had served it well since 1815   and the emergence of  new  imperialism after 1885. Austria-Hungary was not party to this late flowering of empire and its use of war overseas, neither was Germany, but the Entente powers of Britain, France, Russia, and, ultimately, Italy were, with consequences which from 1909 were visited on Europe via the Balkans. Perversely, the historian of Anderson s six who best encapsulates this argument is not known primarily for his work on the Great War. In his magisterial book on European international relations between 1763 and 1848 Paul Schroeder identified the moment in 1815 when the great powers (and Schroeder argued lesser ones too, though Anderson disagrees), fearing that war might trigger revolution, prioritised peace and so created an international order. Anderson s sextet is so diverse, and his treatment of each historian so different, that it is hard to find consistency between them. The repeated refrains   that the July crisis is itself an insufficient explanation for the war, that the long-term origins matter as much as the causes   have been the stuff of debate since the 1920s when German historians responded to the war guilt charge by releasing documents that appeared to situate the beginning of the story with Germany s unification in 1871. To cover this opening period, Anderson begins with Pierre Renouvin, a historian who, as well as being himself a mutil  de guerre, occupied the high ground in French scholarship on the war until his death in 1974. The chapter puts Renouvin in context, by incorporating not just his French contemporaries but also the Americans Sidney Fay and Bernadotte Schmitt who, in 1928 and 1930, wrote the first major works addressing the war s causes in comparative terms. Fay argued that the system had failed and that responsibility was therefore shared. Renouvin disagreed: Germany was guilty because of its decisions in 1914. Anderson s discussion of this historiographical phase is rewarding but it will be hard going for the lay reader: it takes unfamiliar names for granted and gives no account of the war s outbreak. That does not come until the chapter on Christopher Clark s The Sleepwalkers. Luigi Albertini, the author of the three-volume standard work on July 1914, follows Renouvin. Anderson provides a full account of the failure of Italian liberalism before and after the war to explain Albertini s role, as the editor of the Corriere della Sera, in supporting the war and Mussolini s rise to power. Bizarrely, he says less about Albertini s book, the product of his enforced retirement after 1925, or its eventual impact after the Second World War. Anderson s concern with the inherent conservatism of both Renouvin and Albertini finds its fullest flowering in his third case study. Fritz Fischer s two books on German aims during and before the war, published in 1961 and 1969, reignited the debate around German war guilt. They did so by discounting the actions of the other powers and by using fresh evidence in ways that were selective. Anderson is inclined to forgive Fischer because in the process he contributed to Germany s wider liberalisation. However, he is less interested in the furore Fischer provoked (and in who supported him) than in Fischer s credentials as a Nazi and the reasons he changed his political views after the Second World War. Keith Wilson, Anderson s fourth subject, never published his doctoral thesis and is best known for a brief book of essays, The Policy of the Entente, which for all their individual excellence lack an overarching argument and focus entirely on Britain. Although Anderson makes the case for Wilson as a scholar with a broader international perspective, the chapter fails to locate Wilson s output sufficiently in the work of others. Finally we come to Clark and Schroeder. Their chapters are the longest, largely because they are the most discursive: that on Clark gives equal treatment to his most recent book, on the 1848 revolutions; that on Schroeder devotes space to his critique of US foreign policy after 9/11 (another moment when a great power ruptured the order on which it relied). They have two other features in common. Both historians took the focus away from Germany to Austria-Hungary and the Balkans. In this they were anticipated by a historian whom Anderson does not mention. Samuel Williamson s first book, on Anglo-French strategic relations between 1904 and 1914, published in 1969, addressed issues directly relevant to the discussion of Keith Wilson, but it was his book on Austria-Hungary and the war s origins which most effectively shifted the focus of the debate away from Fischer s fixation with Germany. The dual monarchy was the first power to decide on war and it did so because the current system no longer guaranteed its security in the Balkans. Williamson s absence from Disputing Disaster is regrettable. Both Clark and Schroeder also sought to make what they wrote relevant to international relations theory. Clark did so in ways which, as Anderson says, were anachronistic. Schroeder s engagement with theory was much more sophisticated and sustained. The irony is that neither has had much impact on international relations theory, which takes the outbreak of the First World War as a case study of war s origins but remains stubbornly wedded to the Fischer thesis. The 1914 debate has become a case study of disciplinary division, not fusion.

        "target_summary": "Perry Anderson's \"Disputing Disaster\" offers a discerning exploration of the First World War's intricate origins and causes, moving beyond the conflict itself to engage with a century-old scholarly debate. The book meticulously charts the evolution of thought from initial assertions of German war guilt to the prevailing contemporary view of shared responsibility among European powers. Anderson himself champions a systemic understanding, attributing the war's outbreak to the collapse of the Concert of Europe – marked by Austria-Hungary's abandonment of the established order – and the rise of a \"new\" imperialism after 1885, largely driven by the Entente powers and impacting the Continent through the Balkans.\n\nThe core of \"Disputing Disaster\" resides in Anderson's examination of six pivotal historians who have shaped this discourse. Despite the diversity of his chosen sextet and varied treatment of each, a consistent thread emerges: the July 1914 crisis alone is deemed an insufficient explanation, and long-term historical forces are given paramount importance – a perspective that has fueled debate since German historians first challenged war guilt in the 1920s.\n\nThe journey begins with Pierre Renouvin, a towering figure in French scholarship, whose firm belief in Germany's 1914 culpability is juxtaposed with American counterparts like Sidney Fay, who advocated for shared responsibility due to systemic failure. Anderson's discussion of this early historiographical phase, while rich, demands familiarity from the lay reader, reserving details of the war's outbreak for later. Luigi Albertini, author of a seminal three-volume work on July 1914, is notably discussed more for his role in Italian liberalism and support for Mussolini than for the enduring impact of his scholarship, with Anderson perceiving a shared conservatism between him and Renouvin.\n\nThe narrative intensifies with Fritz Fischer, whose 1960s works controversially reignited the German war guilt debate, though Anderson critiques his selective use of evidence while crediting him with contributing to Germany's liberalisation. Anderson, however, focuses more on Fischer's Nazi past and subsequent ideological shift than on the academic firestorm he provoked. Keith Wilson, Anderson's fourth subject, is presented as a scholar with broader international perspective despite his British-centric published works.\n\nThe most expansive chapters are dedicated to Christopher Clark and Paul Schroeder, celebrated for reorienting the analytical lens from Germany towards Austria-Hungary and the Balkans – an intellectual shift regrettably anticipated but uncredited by Anderson to Samuel Williamson. Both Clark and Schroeder also endeavored to link their historical analyses with international relations theory; yet, their efforts, particularly Clark's anachronistic approach, yielded limited impact. The reviewer notes the irony that IR theory, despite embracing WWI as a prime case study, remains stubbornly wedded to the Fischer thesis, highlighting a persistent disciplinary schism rather than integration. Ultimately, Anderson's \"Disputing Disaster\" offers a profound, if occasionally challenging, historiographical journey through the enduring complexities of the Great War's genesis.",

        "content": "With biographies of all the big-name poets of the Great War (with the exception of Wilfred Owen) to her name, Jean Moorcroft Wilson has established herself as the foremost authority on a subject that increasingly informs the way Britain s public views the conflict as a whole. Seeing the war through the prism of these writers of pity and protest may be a distorting mirror, but given the increasingly pacific nature of our society, the view of the war poets may come to be posterity s settled verdict on the struggle. With this weighty volume, which covers Graves  early life, his war experiences and the troubled postwar decade that led up to the publication of his autobiography, Goodbye to All That   hastily written as a money-making potboiler, but now probably the best-known account by a frontline officer   Wilson has again chalked up a formidable achievement. Her special gift is to integrate a penetrating critique of the poetry into her narrative of the life that gave birth to it. In Graves  case this is particularly important as he first suppressed, then neglected the poems he wrote in the trenches, feeling that they were not worthy of his later elevated bardic view of his muse. In fact, many of the poems rediscovered by Wilson are not bad at all and she does Graves  reputation a favour by resurrecting them. Born in the London suburb of Wimbledon to an elderly Irish father and a German mother, Graves grew up in an intellectual atmosphere, amid a tribe of siblings. Bullied at his public school, Charterhouse, he reacted by becoming a boxer and fighting back. About to go up to Oxford, the outbreak of war found him at his family s holiday home in Harlech, North Wales. He enlisted immediately in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Wilson   unafraid to criticise her subject   makes it very clear that Graves was an unpopular officer. His slovenly, individualistic ways defied the army s attempt to force him into a conformist mould. Salvation came in the form of his friendship with Siegfried Sassoon, when his fellow poet joined the same regiment. Though they later fell out over the fibs and inaccuracies in Graves  memoirs, the relationship was crucial to both men, not least when Graves defended his friend after Sassoon protested against the war. Desperately wounded on the Somme, Graves ended the war a nervous and physical wreck. His first marriage ended when he fell under the spell of the poet and essayist Laura Riding. By then he had found his true metier: as a poet. Graves  eventful life and colourful personality has attracted several biographers. Wilson pays him the compliment of treating him as a son, brother, lover, soldier and war victim, but above all as one of Britain s greatest modern writers.

        "target_summary": "Jean Moorcroft Wilson has firmly established herself as the foremost authority on Great War poets, profoundly influencing Britain's understanding of the conflict. Her latest substantial biography, a 'weighty volume' on Robert Graves, proves another formidable achievement, masterfully weaving penetrating critiques of his poetry into the fabric of his life story. This approach is particularly insightful for Graves, who initially suppressed and later neglected his trench poems; Wilson meticulously resurrects these works, enhancing his literary legacy.\n\nThe narrative vividly traces Graves's intellectual London upbringing, his challenging school years at Charterhouse where he cultivated a fighting spirit, and his immediate enlistment in the Royal Welch Fusiliers at the outbreak of WWI. Wilson candidly portrays him as an unpopular, individualistic officer, whose salvation came through his crucial friendship with fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon – a bond so strong Graves staunchly defended Sassoon's anti-war stance. Desperately wounded on the Somme, Graves emerged from the war a nervous and physical wreck. The book further explores his troubled postwar decade, including the end of his first marriage and his influential relationship with Laura Riding, through which he finally embraced his true calling as a poet. Wilson highlights his autobiography, *Goodbye to All That* – originally a 'money-making potboiler' – as now arguably the definitive account by a frontline officer. Ultimately, Wilson honours Graves not only as a complex son, brother, lover, soldier, and war victim, but as one of Britain's greatest modern writers.",

Over the last four years, however, it has been easy to forget that this was not a war in which there were no victors.

        "title": "The End of the First World War",
        "content": "The Seventh Dragoon Guards made one of the last charges of the First World War at 10.30am on 11 November 1918, galloping forward and capturing the bridge at Lessines in the Picardy region of Belgium. Fighting officially ended at 11am on the same day, when the Armistice was signed. On hearing the news, the Fifth Dragoon Guards  official war diary described the celebration as the regiment prepared for a  triumphal march into Germany . While the official diary could easily be written in a celebratory tone, this was not necessarily representative of the feelings that other diaries captured. The war diary of the First West Yorkshire Regiment, for example, wrote that  the news was taken very quietly . Back home, newspapers celebrated and reported that women and children were on the streets flying flags, but news of peace was often met by serving troops with quiet reflection and thanksgiving. As we look back now, over the century since the end of the war, it becomes apparent that reactions to the Armistice have changed to fit in with distinct attitudes towards the war and the years that followed it, which echoed the mood of the nation. Using the personal testimonies, diaries and memoirs of the men who served, we can see the varied reactions of soldiers to news of the Armistice, how they chose to observe the occasion and what happened when they arrived back in Britain and returned to civilian life. Deafening silence Scholars have studied personal testimonies and diaries in order to understand the social aspects of the First World War. Soldiers  responses to the Armistice itself, however, were often muted and sometimes missing from the accounts altogether. Jay Winter and Michael Roper are historians who have remarked on a silence surrounding the war from veterans who returned; servicemen s reactions to the Armistice are no exception. Captain Herman Marsden s memoirs, finally typed up in 1976, contain an interesting discussion of his reasons for not talking about the First World War on his return; he did not want to upset families who had lost loved ones and re-open old wounds by indulging in his memories. He explains:  The fear of causing pain to others was perhaps a reason for my reluctance to recall experiences of World War 1914-1918.  Marsden had been seriously wounded and sent back to England on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Somme and the bloodiest in the British army s history. While many of his colleagues were killed that day, Marsden recovered and was returned to the front lines to fight again before the war was over. In his memoirs he describes his emotions on the day of the Armistice: On the 11th November 1918 there was the Armistice. It was almost unbelievable that there was no longer a world war in progress, and Armistice Day passed by unnoticed, without rejoicing or celebration of any kind. There was not even the slightest sense of relief, but for the survivors there were sad and morbid memories of former colleagues and contemporaries. There was, for me of course, bewilderment and wonder about my survival. Indeed an Armistice to end the World War seemed too great a happening for an ordinary mortal to appreciate fully. Order of Battle on Western Front, 11 A.M Nov 11, 1918. Library of Congress. Public Domain. Although written almost 60 years after the events, Marsden s memoirs reflect perfectly the popular and widespread feeling of the anti-war sentiment of the late 1920s and 1930s. In his memoir, Goodbye To All That, the poet Robert Graves similarly commented: In November came the Armistice. I heard at the same time of the deaths of Frank Jones Bateman, who had gone back again just before the end and Wilfred Owen who often used to send me poems from France. Armistice night hysteria did not touch our camp much, though some of the Canadians stationed there were sent down to Rhyll to celebrate in true overseas style. The news sent me out walking alone above the marshes of Rhuddlen cursing and sobbing and thinking of the dead. Graves was a Captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, who experienced trench warfare. His memoirs were first published in 1929. In many ways, his experiences were similar to Marsden s   both were injured in the Battle of the Somme and recovered from their wounds and returned to the trenches. It is also interesting that Graves  memoir was written around the time of the  peak  in the publishing and consumption of war books and memoirs. Erich Maria Remarque s All Quiet on the Western Front, Ernest Hemingway s A Farewell to Arms, R.C. Sherriff s Journey s End and Richard Aldington s Death of a Hero all emerged in 1929, alongside Goodbye To All That. While the writings of Marsden and Graves are similar, it is important to remember that they were both written a considerable time after the Armistice and both may have had a multitude of reasons for revising what they had felt initially. Did their timely and considered memoirs reflect how men actually felt in November 1918 itself? Goodbye to all that The truth is that it is difficult to know. Not many diaries mention the Armistice. Those written at the time are much more difficult to find and interpret than memoirs written in the late 1920s and after. Many men stopped writing before 11 November 1918; others simply noted that there had been an armistice. The war diary of Chaplain Reverend J.A. Herbert Bell, for example, simply commented:  In the afternoon a wire came through officially that hostilities had ceased at 11am today.  The diary offers no other comment nor any hint of response or emotion. Frustratingly, this is typical of the diaries written during this time. A few did, however, leave clues as to their thoughts and feelings at the outbreak of peace. For many servicemen an end to the war was something that they had been dreaming of for years, but it also brought something uncertain, that was beyond the power of comprehension. The omnipresence of death is a recurring theme in the war diary of Private Thomas Reginald Warner of the West Yorkshire Regiment. Even at the beginning of his war diary, on his first posting to France, Warner was counting the death toll and wondering how long the war would last: Standing apart, down the road that leads north about a mile from the camp is a great graveyard, running right down to the sandy shore. There the little wooden crosses, all alike in form, stand in row upon row, with the sea as a royal blue background. A lovely sight, but a sad one; I wonder how much longer it will be before this sad job is over. Diary entry for 11 November 1918, by Canadian serviceman Louis Llewyllen Lent. Provincial Archives of Alberta. Public Domain. Warner s reflections remained much the same at the end of the war. If anything, the longevity of the conflict only helped to reinforce its seemingly everlasting nature. On 29 June 1918, Warner recorded in his dairy: I wonder how long it will last now? I understand that the Germans have made their last effort and failed. It is rumoured that we shall make an offensive and drive them right back. I wonder when, and if we can. This extract highlights an uncertainty and a weariness about winning the war. While it is not pessimistic, it shows the hearsay and rumour prevalent in the trenches, which may have affected people s experience of the Armistice. For others who served, it is clear that there was a strange, melancholic atmosphere regarding the end of the war. For many soldiers, conflict had become a way of life, a place where they had carved out friendships, tested their resilience and led exciting and worthwhile lives. In complete contrast to the anti-war memoirs of both Marsden and Graves, one soldier, Richard Enden, recalled: There wasn t any real excitement or jubilation at the news [of the Armistice]; naturally we were relieved and I m sure that a weight was lifted from our shoulders, but that was all. The war that everyone hoped would end had ended, but so too had a way of life. Writing of the monumentality of the moment in history, Enden also noted:  It seems funny now to think of the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, in fact many men did not know what the day was. Most were concerned to live only day by day.  Mixed feelings Even away from the front lines, experiences of Armistice Day were not always jubilant. Held in his prison barracks, Cecil Slack remembered the moment of the announcement: As soon as the Armistice was declared, we ceased to answer the bugle call for parade in the barrack square. This caused considerable stamping of feet and angry remarks from our captors   We indicated that as the war was over we should no longer be treated as prisoners. For Slack, the signing of the Armistice quickly and materially changed his circumstances; despite being a prisoner of war, he was also a victor who knew that his imprisonment was now only temporary. A German soldier learns of the Armistice at a POW camp in England, November 1918. Library of Congress. Public Domain. The letters of Arthur George Wilson tell a different story. On his last day of leave on 11 November 1918, Arthur was heading from his home city of York to London to return to his battalion the following day: All London streets are packed. Flags [are] out everywhere. We walked down The Mall to join crowds outside Buckingham Palace. I have never seen such excitement. It is not obvious that he shared the crowd s feelings of excitement. Nevertheless, the fact that he joined in suggests that he was at the very least taken along. The knowledge that he had to return to his regiment may well have muted his reaction. The diary of another private from the West Yorkshire Regiment similarly concluded:  When the Colonel announced that the war was over, we all cheered, but our work was not over. Our next duty was to march to Germany.  Although he was one of the lucky ones, the private was not actually demobilised until the second week of March 1919, five months after Armistice Day. For others, demobilisation was an even longer process. In reality, many soldiers knew that the Armistice did not signal much immediate change in their circumstances, even though hostilities had officially ended. Enden, for example, wrote how feelings of insecurity continued, as men remained on the frontlines, surrounded by the reminders of war:  For the next three or four days a phoney war continued with occasional gunfire and now and again the explosion of a delayed mine.  For many, the prospect of a homecoming remained a distant reality and the process of coming home could feel very slow and protracted. It is possible, too, that the difficult conditions awaiting servicemen in Britain after the Armistice can account for some of the anti-war sentiment of the memoirs written in the late 1920s and 1930s. Homecomings The government feared the return of too many unemployed servicemen too quickly. Despite legislation ensuring that ex-servicemen would return to employment, it did not always happen. The economic depression of the interwar years did little to help relieve the problems of unemployment; those who returned home had to compete in a desperately competitive labour market. Marsden offers an insight into the problems faced by such men. His memoirs are both unusual and illuminating for the detail in which he depicts his postwar life, describing his somewhat unsuccessful attempts at finding a job and returning to normality: A satisfactory military career with a Military Cross and a highly prized  mentioned in despatches , quite correctly had not the slightest value as assets in obtaining employment with cash wherewithal on which to live. Indeed, experiences as a temporary officer was, in many respects, a definite handicap. He recalled that  I was a raw recruit, a veritable  rookie  in a fiercely competitive civilian army.  The government tried a range of tactics, including forcing women out of the workplace, to try to rectify the problem of unemployment among ex-servicemen. Demobilised soldiers received papers to document who they were and where they had been, including any suitable training they had received while in the military. Despite such schemes, however, many men struggled and they, like Marsden, often felt that they had missed out on opportunities, only for others to reap the benefits of their absence. For these men, returning home to a land fit for heroes seemed a mockery. Going to war had meant losing out on more valuable civilian experiences. The Armistice merely signalled the return home to another fight. Unfit for work Despite the levels of unemployment, it must be remembered that these were the lucky ones, who were fortunate that employment was still a valid option. For other soldiers, physical and mental disabilities were the lasting legacies from the war. Over its course, around two million British men suffered from disabling wounds, but survived to go back to civilian life. In 1917 a specialist body was set up to look after all the disabled and seriously wounded servicemen: the Ministry of Pensions. One of its tasks was to pay for the treatment and the pensions of men who had received either lifelong or long-term injuries because of their war service. At its peak, in 1920, there were 1,600,000 ex-servicemen receiving pensions or other forms of aid. Support was offered for those deemed to be both totally and  partially  disabled. Pensions were granted on a sliding scale, depending on how disabled the recipient was judged to be. A serviceman who was considered to be fully disabled and completely incapable of work was assessed at 100 per cent. Private John Cook of the East Yorkshire Regiment was discharged from the army on 22 September 1916 as unfit for military service, having received a bullet wound to the skull. Before the war, Cook had been a joiner, but his injuries meant there was little chance that he could return to that. His disability was assessed at 90 per cent and he was granted a pension for life. He received 32 shillings a week for himself and a 14 shillings a week allowance for his wife and child, until his death in 1950. Other soldiers had a harder time proving their ailments and afflictions. Private Joe Bradley was only awarded a pension of five shillings and 10 pence a week for a period of 12 months for trench fever. His disability was assessed at 20 per cent and the money that he received also included an allowance for his wife and child. Like many others, even this was stopped in 1920 as the government tried to ease the financial burden of costly pensions. The great victory parade passes Buckingham Palace, 5 December 1918. Library of Congress. Public Domain. The responsibility of providing proof proved too difficult for some servicemen, who were denied a pension for their disability. Private Sydney Round served as a driver for the Royal Army Engineering Corps. He was in Gallipoli, Egypt and France after 1916. He applied to the Ministry of Pensions for defective eyesight in the right eye after being gassed. His request was rejected as it was considered to be  not aggravated by the war . Round had to look after himself, without any government aid. Other men were disabled through paralysing mental conditions. While many who were diagnosed as  shell-shocked  recovered quickly from their ailments, others  mental afflictions were prolonged and some would never recover. Thomas Olive explained how his wartime experiences manifested themselves once back in civilian life: I used to have little breakdowns now and then and my wife used to be very frightened. It more or less used to happen at night, when I was in bed. My daughter, incidentally, is terribly nervous. My wife says it s all my fault. Well I had shell shock, you see. I got blown up and it affected my whole system. Patients who had not recovered from their trauma could find themselves admitted to local lunatic asylums, as they were then still called. In many instances, the public were scandalised by this and the government set up a scheme in which ex-servicemen were entitled to a small pension and a separate uniform to mark them out from  pauper lunatics . On 1 January 1920, less than three years after the scheme was proposed, there were already 3,739 patients classed as service patients in institutions in England and Wales. Ten years later that number had risen to 4,618. For many of these institutionalised men, the Armistice meant nothing at all. Many lived on for decades, fighting a war that would never end. The valiant dead It seems clear that a serviceman s experiences of the conflict would have influenced his response to the Armistice, depending on whether he was physically or mentally disabled, or was still fighting when peace was announced. It is also important to remember that these reactions were likely to change over time, as attitudes and situations changed, and are subtly different in memoirs, often written years after the conflict, from those in contemporary diaries, written in the heat of battle. As the years passed, Armistice Day became less of an occasion for the living. By the 1920s and 1930s, commemoration had become more about remembering the valiant dead rather than the inconvenient unemployed ex-servicemen, or those who were simply trying to live with their physical and mental injuries with only a meagre pension allowance from the state. A century on, if interest in the First World War begins to wane after the centenary of the Armistice in November 2018, we would be echoing the reactions of 100 years ago, forgetting the plight of those who returned to bear the scar of war until their deaths, whenever that might have been.

        "target_summary": "The First World War’s thunderous end arrived with a stark paradox on November 11, 1918. Even as the official Armistice was hours away, the Seventh Dragoon Guards made one of the conflict's last charges, capturing a bridge at Lessines. While official war diaries optimistically spoke of triumphal marches into Germany and newspapers at home erupted in jubilant celebration, the news of peace was often met with a far more complex, frequently muted, emotional landscape among the serving troops themselves.\n\nMany contemporary military diaries, surprisingly, offered little more than a factual note of the cessation of hostilities, devoid of the expected elation. The First West Yorkshire Regiment, for instance, recorded the news as being \"taken very quietly.\" This quietude stemmed from years of weary endurance, the omnipresent shadow of death, and a pervasive uncertainty about the future. For soldiers like Private Thomas Reginald Warner, the war's seemingly endless nature had ingrained a day-by-day existence, making the Armistice almost incomprehensible. Richard Enden similarly recalled relief, but \"no real excitement or jubilation,\" recognizing that an entire way of life had ended.\n\nThis initial quiet often evolved into a profound \"silence\" among returning veterans, a phenomenon noted by historians. Later memoirs, penned decades after the conflict, often painted a more somber picture. Captain Herman Marsden, in his 1976 memoirs, described Armistice Day as passing \"unnoticed, without rejoicing or celebration,\" leaving only \"sad and morbid memories\" for survivors. Poet Robert Graves, in his 1929 \"Goodbye To All That,\" recounted cursing and sobbing over lost friends rather than celebrating. These powerful, reflective accounts, often mirroring the burgeoning anti-war sentiment of the 1920s and 30s, acknowledged the passage of time had shaped their understanding, yet deeply conveyed the psychological toll of war.\n\nFor countless soldiers, the Armistice did not signal an immediate end to hardship. Demobilization was a slow, often frustrating process, with many remaining on the front lines amidst lingering dangers, or marching into Germany for months. The grand promise of a \"land fit for heroes\" frequently dissolved into the grim reality of a post-war Britain grappling with economic depression and widespread unemployment. Veterans, despite their valor and military honours, often found their wartime experiences a \"definite handicap\" in the fiercely competitive civilian job market, as Marsden vividly recounted.\n\nFurthermore, millions bore the indelible physical and mental scars of the conflict. The Ministry of Pensions provided some aid, yet support was often insufficient or hard-won. While some, like Private John Cook, received lifelong pensions for severe injuries, others, like Private Joe Bradley for trench fever, were granted only temporary, meagre sums, or, like Private Sydney Round, were outright denied, their ailments deemed \"not aggravated by the war.\" The devastating psychological trauma of \"shell shock\" left many with \"little breakdowns,\" affecting entire families and, in severe cases, leading to institutionalization in \"lunatic asylums\" for decades. For these institutionalized men, the Armistice meant tragically little, as they continued to fight a war that would never truly end.\n\nAs the years passed, public commemoration of Armistice Day subtly shifted. While initial reactions from veterans highlighted a complex array of emotions, the focus gradually moved from the inconvenient plight of living, often struggling, ex-servicemen to the revered memory of the \"valiant dead.\" A century on, it remains vital to remember the full spectrum of experiences surrounding the Armistice and the enduring, profound legacy of the war on those who survived to carry its scars.",

        "title": "The Catastrophe at Caporetto",
        "content": "When Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915, it did so fuelled by optimistic visions of territorial conquest. It hoped to seize the largely Italian-speaking regions around Trento and Trieste at the country s north-east border. Nationalist rhetoric held that acquisition of these areas   along with parts of Dalmatia   would complete the process of unification which had taken place in the second half of the 19th century.  Italians want a greater Italy, by conquest not by purchase, not shamefully but through blood and glory , proclaimed the firebrand poet Gabriele D Annunzio. By late 1917, however, fatigue had set in even among the war s supporters. Little apparent progress had been made on any front, casualties were high and the country s economy was suffering badly. Soldiers in the Italian army hoped that the winter of 1917 would offer some respite. It did not. As rumours of an imminent Austro-Hungarian attack circulated, the Italian army sought to reinforce the mountainous north-eastern battle lines around the town of Caporetto (today Kobarid in Slovenia). The town was positioned on the western side of the Isonzo River, which had partially formed the boundary between Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the war. By October 1917, the front lines ran some six or seven miles east of the river, along the heights of mounts Ursig, Nero and Rosso. Caporetto had been selected by the Central Powers as the target for a major offensive because of the weakness of the Italian defence there. When the expected offensive was launched on 24 October, the resulting battle lasted over a month and was a disaster tantamount to a national trauma. We can witness its opening stage through the eyes of Colonel Francesco Pisani who, as acting general of the Foggia Brigade, found himself and his division part of the Italian drive for reinforcement when he was ordered to Caporetto on 23 October 1917. His brigade had been involved in heavy fighting during the summer in the successful conquest of the Bainsizza plateau, and was now in a state of disarray. He hoped Caporetto would be a quiet posting. The units under his command were struggling with large numbers of green, poorly trained soldiers. Pisani led his men towards divisional headquarters at Caporetto overnight through torrential rain and thick fog. They had barely reached the front-line in the early hours of 24 October when an intense enemy bombardment began along the entire north-eastern line. At dawn, though Pisani and his men did not know it, nine Austro-Hungarian and six German divisions under Otto von Below had launched a major offensive. Germany had agreed to support its ally in what was hoped would be a decisive attack on Italy before winter made campaigning impossible. Domestic tensions in Austria-Hungary, caused by the growing desire for autonomy among the empire s many nationalities, made it imperative to seek victory as quickly as possible. The Central Powers  plan was to smash through the Italian lines, advancing through the valleys to isolate and encircle the Italian defenders who were holding the high ground, before pushing on westward towards the rivers and plains of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia. The Foggia Brigade were advancing directly towards the focal point of this attack. As the morning wore on, orders arrived from divisional headquarters redirecting most of the Foggia Brigade s battalions to other nearby destinations where they would reinforce other units struggling under the Central Powers  assault. As the remaining members of the brigade moved towards Caporetto, they began to encounter large numbers of troops retreating down the same narrow mountain road that they were ascending, bringing with them terrible stories about the fighting ahead. After reaching divisional HQ at Caporetto, Pisani and his men were sent to defend the vital Eiffel Bridge. This was one of the few crossings over the fast-flowing Isonzo, which lay in a deep gorge. If the bridge were lost, several Italian divisions on the east bank of the river and on the mountain slopes above it would be entirely cut off. As German units infiltrated the area, encircling the high peaks of Mount Nero and Rosso up ahead, large numbers of Italian troops were seeking to retreat to the relative safety of the west bank and of Caporetto itself. Without the Eiffel Bridge, this evacuation would be impossible. The divisional commander had ordered a general retreat and abandoned control of the town to the Foggia Brigade. Pisani later described his task in his official post-battle debriefing: There was total confusion, the road was almost entirely blocked by a mass of troops, carts, horses, trucks, artillery pieces, mules, and supplies. Officers' cars were unable to make any headway, and it was very hard to execute or even transmit any orders. At this point, the various components of the Brigade became separated, in the chaos, the freezing fog and the rain. We also tried to organise transport for the wounded, many of who had been abandoned in the road. We could hear them groaning through the fog, and it was imperative to move them since their presence was demoralising the defenders of the bridge. By mid-afternoon, Italian army headquarters in Udine, some 25 miles away, were still in complete ignorance of the scale of events. Not until 10pm would Chief of General Staff Luigi Cadorna learn the true dimensions of what the Italian troops were suffering at the country s north-eastern boundary. The situation was a catalogue of woe: indecisive senior commanders, munitions shortages, information blackouts, missing officers and communication breakdowns all worked against a few desperately stretched individuals doing their best to contain the German assault under driving rain and freezing fog. At around 3pm on 24 October, Italian engineers blew up the Eiffel Bridge that the Foggia Brigade was supposed to be defending. At least two Italian divisions were trapped on the eastern side of the river, their retreat cut off. Pisani described the scene: There was no immediate command in the town of Caporetto itself. The order to destroy the bridge must have been given by a senior officer   but when? Perhaps it had been issued in an uncertain and unclear fashion. I concluded that the decision must have been based on the supposition that the enemy was still on the east bank of the Isonzo   but this was not at all the case, and given that the Germans had already crossed the river [further to the south], the destruction of the bridge served no useful purpose. I was ordering the rearrangement of our remaining machine gun posts for a better defence of the position, at about 17.00, and my few staff and I were making our way from one post to another when we suddenly found ourselves confronted by a large group of German soldiers. We had no idea the enemy had approached so close. Concealing themselves in one of the half-ruined buildings along the road, they were able to ambush and encircle us easily. Threatening us with rifles and bayonets, the enemy disarmed us so quickly that there was barely time to even think. This was the end of Pisani s war; captured with his staff, he was despatched to a prisoner of war camp at Karlsruhe in Germany. Leaderless and isolated, the Foggia Brigade stood little chance. Most of the patrols Pisani had sent out in search of information had already been surrounded in the fog. By the end of the day 3,577 of its men had been taken prisoner, while the Central Powers had advanced around 14 miles, seizing bridges, and were established on the west bank of the Isonzo. Around 20,000 Italians were captured that day and by the time the battle ended, a month later, more than 280,000 had been taken by the enemy, almost half of all those captured during the war. * The opening phase of the battle, from 24 October to 3 November, was the most damaging to Italy. The chaotic scenes and mass captures that Pisani witnessed were repeated up and down the peaks and valleys of the north-eastern front. As enormous numbers of troops began to retreat, often without munitions and officers, panic set in and a disorderly mass flight began. By 27 October, the Supreme Command was no longer confident that even the  extreme  line of defence, nearly 45 miles away on the river Tagliamento, would be able to hold. This was where Italy s last prepared defensive positions were located, but Chief of General Staff Cadorna began to contemplate a further withdrawal to the river Piave. The next day, he and his staff abandoned their headquarters at Udine and joined the retreat. The first enemy troops reached Udine at around 3pm; it would soon become the new Austro-Hungarian HQ. The retreating Italians reached the Tagliamento on 31 October. By 3 November the enemy, too, had reached this river, as Italian troops fell back towards the Piave, around 100 miles behind the original front. In the first five days of the battle, huge numbers of Italians were captured but as the retreat continued losses were increasingly caused by desertion. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers fled back into Italy from the positions they had conquered in the first two and a half years of the war. Luigi Albertini, editor of the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera, visited the front on 30 October 1917.  For the most part, the troops did not fight. When sent forward they discarded their weapons and returned unarmed , he reported. Many men claimed that they had been told that the war was over, so it was not only permissible but sensible to head home. In total 300,000 men were  scattered  during the battle. It was impossible to say whether they had voluntarily absconded or simply got lost in the chaos of the retreat. * The speed and extent of the Austro-German offensive had taken the Italian forces by surprise, but it was equally unexpected to the attackers themselves. As a result, they struggled to capitalise on their advance. Bringing up fresh troops and keeping their artillery moving forward proved difficult owing to fleeing civilians, broken bridges and disordered roads, which had also delayed the Italian retreat. This gave the Italians time to regroup. In the second phase of the battle, beginning once the Italians had reached the Tagliamento on 3 November, they began to recover their fighting capacity as the demoralised forces were replaced by more solid and resilient troops drawn from the reserves and from the Alpine front in the north, which had been untouched by the Central Powers  attack. The retreat was controlled and disciplined. Gradually the line stabilised, taking up a new defensive position on the Piave on 9 November. The new front, which was maintained until October 1918, was hundreds of kilometres shorter than the original and thus more easily manned. The terrain, too, was more hospitable, allowing for more effective lines of communication. The third and final phase of the battle started on 12 November and lasted for six days. The Austro-German offensive was renewed, with a final push to break through Italian lines towards Venice. British intelligence reported that  Germany and Austria count on the collapse of Italy during the coming winter . But the push was unsuccessful: the Piave line held, with support from French and British forces, who took over their own sections on 21 November. The battle finally ended on 26 November as the new front stabilised. The front line would remain in this position until the final weeks of the war. By the battle s conclusion more than 5,000 square miles of Italian territory was in enemy hands. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of prisoners and dispersed soldiers, the Italian army also lost 40,000 soldiers who were either killed or wounded during the battle. German and Austro-Hungarian casualties numbered 50,000. Over one million civilian refugees had been forced to flee from the advancing Austro-German troops; many more remained trapped in occupied territory, suffering death, sickness and deprivation under Habsburg military rule. Italy s losses were not limited to land and people. The young Lieutenant Erwin Rommel, fighting south of Caporetto with the W rttemberg Mountain battalion, recollected with pleasure the  chocolate, eggs, preserves, grapes and white bread  which his troops seized and which made their morale  wonderful!  Over 10 million ration sets, and more than six million tins of fish or meat, were among the Italian supplies captured by the advancing Central Powers forces, along with 1,309 tonnes of dried pasta, 645 tonnes of cheese and 253 tonnes of coffee. Of even more interest to Rommel s men, perhaps, was their share of the captured wine (five million litres) and cognac (1,600 litres). The Italians also lost significant stores of clothing and bedding: 966,000 coats and waterproofs, 69,000 hats, 320,000 pairs of boots and 1.5 million pairs of pants and socks along with 295,000 sheets and blankets. Engineers lost more than 17,000 tonnes of essential material, while thousands of trucks and tens of thousands of horses and mules   with their fodder   were abandoned to the enemy. Some 3,000 artillery pieces and a similar number of machine guns were lost, which Italy could ill afford given its shortages of these essential weapons. Several field hospitals with all their beds, iodine and medicines were taken. The loss of significant amounts of coal meant that Italy became dependent on imports from its allies. * The consequences of the defeat were dramatic and a great deal of national soul-searching followed with immediate changes at the highest levels. The prime minister, Paolo Boselli, was replaced by the experienced liberal lawyer Vittorio Orlando. Cadorna was forced out. His high-handed, inflexible leadership was unpopular with civilian politicians and his military abilities had been questioned even before the catastrophic events of Caporetto. Orlando did not want to work with him and nor did the Allies, whose representatives arrived in Italy at the end of October. The allies met at Rapallo, near Genoa, on 5 November, with the battle still raging. They agreed to support Italy and created the Supreme War Council (SWC), a kind of allied general staff. This offered an ideal way to remove Cadorna, who was shifted  upwards  into the SWC, and replaced as Chief of the General Staff by Armando Diaz, a younger, more dynamic and tactful general. Diaz would transform the army s training, formation-level tactics, morale, command structures, leave policies and more. Where Cadorna had stifled initiative and confidence   sacking and demoting commanders at the drop of a hat   Diaz was more open to suggestions and to delegation. Cadorna s dismissal suggested that he was responsible for the defeat, but allocation of blame caused a political row, beginning within 48 hours of the initial attack. Concerns about disaffection and defeatism among the troops had been growing. The authorities feared that  subversive  socialist propaganda was destroying the army s fighting spirit. Cadorna was quick to advance this interpretation. On 28 October he had declared that  the inadequate resistance of units of 2nd Army, cowardly retreating without fighting or ignominiously surrendering to the enemy, has permitted the Austro-German forces to break our left wing on the Julian front . This was damaging to the Italian army s image both nationally and internationally. The Italian ambassador to London recalled that even George V made disparaging comments about the Italian troops  performance. Attributing blame for defeat on the soliders was oddly endorsed by elements of both the right   who saw it as proof of socialist-inspired cowardice and pacifism   and the left, who interpreted it as a  military strike , which demonstrated that the masses had turned against the war. In truth, it is unfair to claim that the frontline units who faced the Austro-German assault on 24 October or the days after failed to fight. The Foggia Brigade s experience of conflicting orders, inadequate supplies and unsuitable defensive positioning was representative of the whole. Many reports suggest that the men fought bravely with determination for as long as they had officers and munitions. Once these two essentials were lost it was hard to keep a positive outlook, as a battalion commander from the 224th infantry regiment recalled: On the night of 23 October my men were in good spirits but by the end of the next day they were less confident. By the end of 25 October, the unit had become mixed with others, the men had not slept for 24 hours and had no more munitions. At this stage they became  morally prisoners  and in a state of depression began to accept the prospect of capture and imprisonment. Under these circumstances large groups of men could be captured by small enemy detachments. The Italian army s defence strategy was also responsible for the defeat. Cadorna had decided to hold the mountainous peaks at all costs while neglecting the valleys below; the Germans simply advanced with speed through these valleys, encircling the defenders on the peaks. Caporetto was a devastating military defeat, but it was one with clearly identifiable strategic, operational and tactical causes. * The battle almost immediately assumed the name of the town where the decisive breakthrough had been made and soon became an emblem of Italian military failure. For decades it was associated with anti-war sentiment, desertion and cowardice. The novelist Carlo Emilio Gadda, who was trapped and captured after the premature destruction of the Eiffel Bridge, described his experience as one of  spiritual horrors . In a sense, the whole country reacted this way. Pisani wrote that  the sacrifice of blood made by the regiments could not hope to dam up the invading tide ; that tide swept away two and a half years worth of gains, made at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. Italy s victory in the First World War came in the battle of Vittorio Veneto, symbolically (if coincidentally) launched on 24 October 1918. Yet the scars left by Caporetto were hard to heal. The shadows of those foggy, chaotic days in the mountains loomed large into the postwar years. Vanda Wilcox is the author of Morale and the Italian Army during the First World War (Cambridge University Press, 2016).",
        "target_summary": "Italy entered the First World War in May 1915, driven by soaring nationalist aspirations and a fervent belief in territorial expansion. It envisioned completing national unification by seizing Italian-speaking regions from Austria-Hungary, fueling a rhetoric of \"blood and glory.\" However, by late 1917, these optimistic dreams had soured. War fatigue, crippling casualties, economic suffering, and little apparent progress on any front had left the nation profoundly weary.\n\nIt was into this atmosphere of mounting exhaustion that the devastating Battle of Caporetto unfolded. As rumours of an imminent Austro-Hungarian offensive swirled, Italian reinforcements, including Colonel Francesco Pisani's disorganised Foggia Brigade, converged on the mountainous north-eastern front near Caporetto. Pisani, hoping for a quiet posting after brutal summer fighting, instead found his unit filled with inexperienced recruits.\n\nOn the night of October 23, 1917, Pisani led his men through torrential rain and thick fog towards Caporetto, strategically positioned on the Isonzo River. In the early hours of October 24, a ferocious bombardment erupted along the entire line. Unbeknownst to the Italians, fifteen Austro-Hungarian and German divisions, commanded by Otto von Below, had launched a massive, decisive offensive. Their plan was to sweep through the valleys, encircling Italian defenders on the high ground before pushing west. Pisani's brigade found itself advancing directly into the furious epicenter of this assault.\n\nAs the morning wore on, chaos reigned. Pisani's brigade was split and redeployed to bolster crumbling defenses, while terrified Italian troops streamed down the narrow mountain roads, bringing tales of utter devastation. Reaching Caporetto, Pisani was tasked with defending the vital Eiffel Bridge over the fast-flowing Isonzo, the sole escape route for several trapped Italian divisions. The town itself descended into pandemonium, a \"total confusion\" of men, vehicles, and abandoned wounded. Orders were impossible to transmit, and command disintegrated.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, Italian engineers prematurely destroyed the Eiffel Bridge, sealing the fate of at least two divisions still on the eastern bank. Pisani, bewildered by the order given the enemy had already crossed the river further south, was reorganizing his remaining machine gun posts when he and his staff were ambushed and captured by German soldiers who had infiltrated the town undetected. His war was over; the leaderless Foggia Brigade soon succumbed.\n\nThe opening phase of Caporetto, from October 24 to November 3, was a national trauma. The initial collapse led to a disorderly mass flight, with hundreds of thousands of troops retreating, often without munitions or officers. By November 3, Italian forces had fallen back some 100 miles to the Piave River. The sheer speed and scale of the Austro-German advance caught even the attackers by surprise, hindering their ability to consolidate gains. However, the Italian losses were staggering: over 5,000 square miles of territory, more than 280,000 prisoners (almost half of all Italians captured in the war), 40,000 killed or wounded, and vast quantities of essential supplies – from millions of food rations and litres of wine to thousands of artillery pieces and vehicles – were lost or abandoned. Over a million civilians fled their homes.\n\nThe defeat triggered immediate and profound national soul-searching. Prime Minister Boselli and the autocratic Chief of General Staff Luigi Cadorna were swiftly replaced by Vittorio Orlando and the more dynamic Armando Diaz. Cadorna, initially blaming his soldiers for \"cowardly retreating,\" ignited a political storm. However, the true culprits were soon identified: deeply flawed strategic and tactical decisions, such as Cadorna's insistence on holding mountain peaks while neglecting the valleys, coupled with inadequate supplies, poor communication, and utterly disorganized command structures. Frontline units, Pisani's experience showed, often fought bravely until leadership and munitions vanished.\n\nCaporetto became a searing symbol of military failure, associated for decades with defeatism and chaos. Yet, from its ashes, a reformed Italian army under Diaz gradually stabilized the front on the Piave by November 9, eventually holding this line until the war's final weeks. Italy's ultimate victory at Vittorio Veneto, launched ironically on October 24, 1918, could not entirely erase the haunting shadow of Caporetto – a disaster born of shattered hopes and the brutal reality of war.",

        "title": "Desolation Row: Victorian Britain s Sensational Slums",
        "content": "On 2 November 1895, Rosina Meagher, a young Welsh woman, was attacked by her husband. The assault left her seriously injured. Rosina lived in a notorious lane in Newport known as  Quiet Woman s Row , so-called satirically in the local press as a shorthand for the domestic violence   aimed at women   that was seen as typical of slum areas. Coverage of Quiet Woman s Row in the local press   and its gratuitous focus on violence   was typical of the late-Victorian and Edwardian penchant for  slumland storytelling , where sensational coverage of life in the slums that blighted towns and cities across Britain served as a means of arguing for urban redevelopment   and selling newspapers. Several prominent writers wrote about the urban slum during this period, including Jacob Riis, George Sims, Margaret Harkness, Arthur Morrison and Jack London. Slums   the first recorded use of the word is in 1825   were one symptom of the mass growth in population which occurred in the first half of the 19th century. The shift from agricultural to industrial labour saw people move to urban areas where cheap housing, designed to be fairly short-term, was built on land under short leases to accommodate them. Increasingly, a number of families found themselves crammed in, and unsanitary conditions followed. Fact and fiction frequently merged when it came to depicting slum life. The sordid stories became entertainment for readers who enjoyed the tales at a safe distance.  Slum tourism  developed, where members of polite society went to see for themselves what the slums were like. In the 1890s, the press reported that an unnamed young girl from a wealthy background had been reported missing. Detectives eventually located her in a slum dwelling in East London; the girl had been so  enthused  by Walter Besant s All Sorts and Conditions of Men (1882) that she had decided to visit the area to see how the poor really lived. After telling one resident about her rich parents, she had been abducted, in the hope that her father would pay a ransom for her release. Reports of this girl s misadventure neatly reflect the tropes of  slumland storytelling    a term coined by the historian Alan Mayne to describe the way newspapers in this period increasingly reported criminal incidents in the slum in a manner calculated to appeal to their middle-class, literate, readership. The press created melodramatic tales of slum life, stressing the inherent criminality of slum dwellers who were presented as clearly gendered stereotypes. Men were thugs; women were either unfeminine, displaying a lack of mothering instincts towards their children, or innocents who had married and become victims of domestic violence, left cowering in their slums, or desperately seeking to maintain respectability in the face of abject poverty. Children were either feral, running around in the streets with little parental guidance, or   like the women   innocent beings who, if removed from their environment, might thrive. Women were the focus of this style of storytelling, falling into one of two categories: uncouth criminals or submissive sexual victims. And because women were seen as being akin to children, their loss of virtue, or their criminality, was particularly shocking. Slum stories, of course, were written by outsiders and shaped by preconceptions of slum life. In 1894, the Liverpool Mercury reported the graphic yet intimate details of a local magistrate s experiences of the city s slums. Here, a member of the respectable classes had ventured into the dangerous slums to see the residents  lives and had come back to share his exploits with the rest of his class. It was reported that the main features of slum life were  squalor, drunkenness, improvidence, lawlessness, immorality and crime . Such stories made readers feel as though part of their city was like the Wild West. In 1899, the Belfast-based Northern Whig published a large feature that pushed for wholesale slum clearances. Until this happened, it argued, the slum would remain  the same foul, dangerous quarter of obscenity, filth and degradation  where sin, vice and crime were rife. It depicted destitute female residents existing on weak tea and bread, dying mothers unable to feed their babies and children starving and  vermin-swarmed . It eagerly noted how  drunkenness, harlotry, murder and bestiality  were ever-present in areas where distinctions between sexes were  unknown  due to communal living in doss houses, before including a graphic tale of one wife, the victim of domestic violence, cowering from her  sullen, drunken, murderous brute  of a husband, while he ripped her clothing. This sort of gratuitous writing was not confined to newspaper reports; a genre known as  slum fiction  became popular, including well-known titles such as George Gissing s The Nether World and Arthur Morrison s A Child of the Jago as well as the popular  penny dreadfuls . In the reports  detailing of the beaten wife s flushed face, agonised eyes and torn bodice it particularly resembles the latter. There was a clear sexual element to the violence, as the descriptions of bestiality and harlotry suggest. The account certainly emphasised the brutality of slum life, but it also aimed to titillate its readers. In press reports, individual incidents and criminal cases were seen as symptomatic of slum life. Any case that came before the local courts would be pounced on if the parties involved lived in slum areas. The fact of their residence made their lives immediately newsworthy. Such was the case of Rosina Meagher and Quiet Woman s Row. A notorious dockside street in the Pillgwenlly district of Newport, south Wales, the Row had been the subject of an increasing number of newspaper articles in the years before Rosina s case made the news. These had focused primarily on the female residents  tendency towards crime and disorder, despite the fact that the majority of such cases involved petty offences. These included fights over the use of shared washing-lines, arguments over keeping animals in backyards and the theft of coal from the nearby docks. It is true that the verbal and minor assaults frequently involved women, but this is inevitable given that they tended to spend more time at home than their husbands, who worked at the docks. Domestic spaces were cramped and busy, leading to an understandable loss of temper   but motivation and cause were not of interest to the press. From the mid-1870s onwards, newspapers increasingly focused on the  not so quiet women  of Quiet Woman s Row, referring to the lane as  the locality miscalled Quiet Woman s Row  and  that paradox of female Paradise . When Thomas Meagher was tried for the attempted murder of his wife, the case was covered extensively in Wales. There were expos s of Rosina s poverty-stricken life, where  there was not a particle of furniture in the house . Slum women were usually either  untidy women  and inadequate housekeepers, or innocents corrupted by the slum. Rosina was to be the latter, the bourgeois ideal of womanhood; a pretty, golden-haired girl with an alcoholic, abusive husband, who, despite living in a slum street, kept her house and its exterior tidy, so that it  presents a cleaner aspect than others . Rosina Meagher became a slumland sensation. The Evening Express sent a reporter out to investigate the den of iniquity from which she had emerged: Instead of being the quarters of orderly females, it is quite the reverse, and hardly a police-court is held but what some disorderly case is heard from that quarter   Our reporter, who visited it on Saturday morning, says it is a typical abode of the poorest clan of Irish folk. A group of coarse, dirty women stood, with their bare arms akimbo, discussing  the murder , whilst a dozen of half-dressed children were sitting about the road, apparently playing. It was, the report said, a poverty-stricken street with residents who partook in gossip while their children roamed around, neglected. But there was fear, as well as curiosity, in how the case was reported. As a result of the press coverage, slum tourists converged on the Row to see how the poor of their town lived and to see where a woman was nearly murdered. When a case as horrific as the Meagher attack made the pages of the newspapers, there was a desire by those in Newport to distance themselves from the poor in their area. This area of the town was  not to do with them    it was alien, other, separate from, and outside of,  ordinary  society. * Slum stories appeared against the backdrop of major economic and social change. Newspapers were full of reports of houses being bought and sold for some quite considerable sums; but alongside this were stories about houses in Quiet Woman s Row not selling, of short-term leases that resulted in residents frequently moving on and of landlords failing to maintain their properties. No link was made between the high instances of petty crime in the Row and unemployment, low wages or poor living conditions. Yet there were regularly appeals for something to be done about the Row. In 1850, a report into the sanitation of the town had described it in grim terms: damp and filthy, with only one outside privy to serve 14 houses and an ever-present stench due to the existence of an open rubbish pit. Over the next half century, there continued to be problems getting the landlords of these cheaply built houses to accept responsibility for maintaining them. In 1888, the owner of a two-roomed house   let to a family of seven   was called to the police court for allowing the premises  to be in a filthy and overcrowded condition . Residents themselves demonstrated some agency in 1875, organising a petition that was submitted to the council, calling attention to  the closet accommodation to the houses at west end of Quiet Woman s Row, which is a disgrace and a nuisance to the neighbourhood . The following year, one magistrate  made further allusion to the unsatisfactory condition of Quiet Woman s Row  and noted that 68 residents had to share two privies. The owner was served notice to provide four additional closets, although there is no evidence that they did. In 1887, a press report speculating that the Row would be demolished to make way for a new railway and station serving the dockyard made no reference to the impact it would have on residents, but enthused, instead, on the benefit of such plans to the whole borough of Newport. The residents of the Row were living in conditions regarded as among the worst in the area, where the struggle to even get the most basic of amenities took years and where they were seen by the rest of Newport as, essentially, a foreign presence. The focus on criminality in the Row was not entirely unfounded. Some residents did commit offences, which was also the case in many other slum areas. A few of the women in the Row were repeat offenders, but men also appeared in court, often for more serious offences, including severe physical assaults and attempted murders. Many petty offences were understandable given the economic and spatial pressures on residents of both genders; there were fights over shared spaces, an impatience with sharing tiny, unhygienic houses with multiple other occupants, including grown-up children, and financial worries that saw many steal small coal and others unable to pay the required maintenance when their children ended up in the local reformatories. In 1893, a resident called Thomas Flynn told the court he could not pay a fine  because for some time past work had been very dead . But overwhelmingly press coverage focused on the women of the Row. Virtue, once subjected to the realities of the slum, was soon lost. Quiet Woman s Row became shorthand for crime, disorder and filth. It was soon at the forefront of the local press  attempts to see slums swept aside in the name of progress. Newsprint influenced both public opinion and local government policy. By focusing on the crimes rather than their underlying causes and by making the Row a no man s land where fearless investigative reporters volunteered to visit and report on the inhabitants as though they were a foreign tribe, press coverage made the Row appear not a part of Newport   and if it wasn t part of Newport, it shouldn t be there. Soon it wasn t   it was demolished in 1899, and the last reference to it in the press, in 1910, made clear that it was a piece of history deservedly consigned to the past. The sensationalism of slum reporting had been replaced by a mere footnote in an article about  curious  place names of the past.

        "target_summary": "In 1895, the brutal assault of Rosina Meagher, a young Welsh woman, by her husband in Newport's notorious \"Quiet Woman's Row\" ignited a potent media sensation. This ironically named street became a stark emblem for the pervasive domestic violence and squalid conditions the late-Victorian and Edwardian press sensationalized under the guise of \"slumland storytelling.\" This journalistic phenomenon, fueled by a desire for urban redevelopment and increased newspaper sales, blurred the lines between fact and fiction, transforming the grim realities of poverty into captivating, often lurid, entertainment for a curious middle-class readership.\n\nThe rapid urbanization and industrial shift of the 19th century had spawned overcrowded slums, where cheap, temporary housing fostered unsanitary conditions. These \"dens of iniquity\" provided rich fodder for writers and journalists alike, who crafted melodramatic narratives that painted slum dwellers with broad, gendered strokes. Men were invariably depicted as violent \"thugs\"; women were either \"unfeminine\" matriarchs lacking maternal instinct, or, more often, vulnerable \"innocents\" ensnared in cycles of domestic abuse, clinging desperately to respectability. Children were portrayed as feral street urchins or pure souls awaiting rescue. Women, particularly, became the focus, categorized as either uncouth criminals or submissive sexual victims, their supposed loss of virtue or criminality deemed particularly shocking. These narratives, always penned by outsiders, perpetuated deep-seated preconceptions of moral decay, portraying parts of cities as lawless \"Wild West\" territories.\n\n\"Slum tourism\" flourished, with polite society venturing into these \"dangerous\" quarters. Calls for wholesale slum clearances, like those in the Belfast-based Northern Whig, vividly detailed scenes of destitution, dying mothers, starving children \"vermin-swarmed,\" and omnipresent \"drunkenness, harlotry, murder and bestiality.\" Graphic descriptions of abused wives cowering from \"sullen, drunken, murderous brute[s]\" underscored a titillating, sexualized element to the violence, extending even to the popular \"slum fiction\" genre of the era.\n\nQuiet Woman's Row, a dockside street riddled with generations of sanitation issues and landlord neglect, epitomized these narratives. Its residents had long struggled for basic amenities, sharing woefully inadequate privies and enduring cramped, unsanitary homes. Though minor offences like arguments over washing lines or coal theft were common, often understandable given the harsh living conditions, the press relentlessly focused on the \"not so quiet women,\" portraying them as inherently disorderly. Rosina Meagher, positioned as a \"bourgeois ideal\" corrupted by her environment, became a national \"slumland sensation.\" Reporters descended, creating vivid scenes of \"coarse, dirty women\" and \"half-dressed children,\" reinforcing the image of an alien, morally bankrupt community.\n\nCrucially, newspaper reports consistently ignored the root causes of slum conditions—unemployment, low wages, and structural poverty—preferring instead to sensationalize crime and moral failings. This narrative strategy profoundly shaped public opinion and local policy. By depicting Quiet Woman's Row as a foreign, unsavable entity, distinct from \"ordinary\" Newport, the press effectively paved the way for its ultimate demise. In 1899, the Row was demolished, a relic of a \"curious\" past, its complex human stories ultimately reduced to a mere historical footnote, swept aside in the name of progress, fueled by the very sensationalism it had once embodied.",

        "content": "When Penguin published The Buildings of England: London Except the Cities of London and Westminster, Pevsner's text referred to the Rowton Houses in Camden Town as 'still belonging to the slums'. This brought a threat of action against the publisher for defamation. Rowton Houses are now largely forgotten, but figure in the Homes of the Homeless exhibition at the Geffrye Museum. Starting with life on the streets, the exhibition reveals that the homeless had to sleep during the day because the police moved them on at night. Homelessness became an acute problem in London as the drift from the country to the towns accelerated in the early 19th century. Itinerant workers, 'Navigators' or 'navvies', arrived in vast numbers to dig the canal network and to build the railway lines. Where were they to be housed? What would they eat? If a labourer lost his job, he and his family might be made homeless. The rapid growth of slums, often in close proximity to wealthy areas, alarmed those of the middling class and motivated religious zealots. Faster, cheaper methods of graphic reproduction fed the consternation of the better-off. Magazines such as the Graphic, the Illustrated London News and the Sketch shocked their readers with pictures of poverty. Religious campaigners fuelled controversy with pamphlets detailing the horrors of the slums. For the most part the curators ignore missionary campaigns, instead concentrating on housing provision. This varied from the municipal workhouse to common lodging houses. Visitors to the Geffrye can see what 'picking oakum' actually means; the bold may try a replica 'coffin bed' for size. Prince Albert, in his quest to improve housing for the poor, took up the architect Henry Roberts in the 1840s. Roberts was the honorary architect to the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes. Large watercolours and a model of his flats for the society open the exhibition. Built near the British Museum in 1849, they still stand today. They illustrate a problem for the reformers: how to design large buildings, for multiple occupation by separate families, without them being liable to Window Tax? A humble fourth-rate family house with six windows or fewer was exempt, a large block for a hundred people would be taxed at a shilling per window. Roberts was commissioned to design model cottages for poor families, which were shown at the Great Exhibition in 1851, the year that the Window Tax was repealed, permitting the building of immense blocks. Paintings in the exhibition tend to be sentimental rather than controversial, our empathy with photographs is more immediate. Jack London concealed a small camera about him when he lived rough in London. He used his surreptitious photographs to illustrate his People of the Abyss (1903). Photographs, whether taken secretly, or by those in positions of power, allow for no self-conscious posing: a queue of women awaiting free tea, eye the photographer unconcernedly. Almost life-size, their steady gaze is disconcerting. Their ragged clothes not a style statement, but the only ones that they possessed. Charles Dickens had known the horror of the workhouse and loathed the blacking factory to which he was sent to work. A fragment of a blacking bottle is shown, as is a bowl such as might have been used by Oliver Twist. An unexpected exhibit is a stuffed and mounted stag's head from a Rowton House. The caption claims that they were considered as luxurious as gentlemen's clubs in the West End. Spartan as the establishments of Pall Mall and St James's may be, they are not as grim as Rowton lodgings. Pevsner was not dragged into court: the management of the Rowton Houses were content with an apology and an erratum slip. Sportingly, they sent Pevsner an invitation to spend a night to see for himself. His reaction is not recorded, but one suspects he did not see the joke. Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London is at the Geffrye Museum until July 12th, 2015. David Brady is a historian of art, architecture and design.",
        "target_summary": "The Geffrye Museum's \"Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London\" exhibition vividly illuminates the harsh realities of destitution, serendipitously linking back to Pevsner's controversial description of Rowton Houses as \"slums.\" This exhibition, which once threatened a defamation suit for its publisher, now delves into the largely forgotten world of London's Victorian homeless.\n\nThe exhibition uncovers the genesis of this acute social crisis, which escalated in the early 19th century as rural populations flocked to urban centers. Massive influxes of \"navvies\" for canal and railway construction created an urgent need for housing, and job loss often plunged families into immediate homelessness. The resulting proliferation of slums, startlingly close to affluent areas, ignited alarm among the middle classes and zealots alike. This consternation was fueled by new, cheaper graphic reproduction methods, allowing magazines like *The Graphic* to shock readers with stark images of poverty, while religious pamphlets sensationalized slum horrors. Eschewing missionary narratives, the curators instead focus on the practicalities of housing provision, from the grim municipal workhouse, where visitors can ponder the meaning of 'picking oakum' or brave a replica 'coffin bed', to common lodging houses.\n\nReform efforts are highlighted, notably Prince Albert's patronage of architect Henry Roberts in the 1840s. Roberts's pioneering flats, built near the British Museum in 1849 and still standing, exemplify the era's design challenges, particularly the oppressive Window Tax. Its eventual repeal in 1851, the year Roberts's model cottages debuted at the Great Exhibition, finally enabled the construction of immense, multi-occupancy blocks for the working poor.\n\nThe power of visual representation is a central theme. While contemporary paintings often offered sentimentalized views of poverty, photography provided an immediate, unvarnished truth. Secretly taken photographs, like Jack London's for *The People of the Abyss*, and official images alike, capture unposed subjects—a queue of ragged women awaiting tea, their disconcertingly steady gaze revealing the raw dignity of survival. Echoes of personal hardship resonate through exhibits like a fragment of a blacking bottle, reminiscent of Charles Dickens's own childhood trauma, and objects like a bowl evoking Oliver Twist's plight. Unexpectedly, a stuffed stag's head from a Rowton House, paradoxically claiming a luxurious equivalence to West End gentlemen's clubs, underscores the desperate attempt to elevate these stark lodgings. Ultimately, the Pevsner incident resolved amicably with an apology and a facetious invitation, reminding us of the human element behind these historical accounts.",

        "title": "Welcome to Dottyville",
        "content": "During the First World War, specialist hospitals were established, intended to  cure  patients of shell shock and send them back to the front. One curative approach was ergotherapy, or  cure by functioning , a treatment we would today identify as occupational therapy, which encouraged patients to remain active and take part in work and recreational activities. This emphasis on activity as cure is rooted in the changes to mental health care which began with the work of  mad-doctor  William Battie in the 1700s. Care for  the insane  shifted away from the more oppressive methods employed in early asylums, towards humane care and moral discipline. One of the key changes   alongside an emphasis on regimen, work and recreation   was the prioritisation of patients  creative expression. In the long 19th century, patients at sanatoria were encouraged to paint, knit and write poetry and prose as part of their care. As a result of this, a number of establishments, from 1837 until the mid-20th century, produced patient-led hospital magazines. Craiglockhart War Hospital, a military psychiatric hospital in Edinburgh, introduced a hospital magazine in 1917, for which some soldiers wrote as part of their therapeutic treatment. It was called The Hydra, in reference to the hospital s prewar role as a centre for hydrotherapy, where the Victorians had come for water treatments. It also evoked the many-headed monster of Greek mythology, reinforced by its cover image of the terrible creature   a reference writer John Garth says was  wry humour by officers suffering from war trauma . Edited for a time by Wilfred Owen and including poems by fellow writer Siegfried Sassoon, who referred to the hospital as  Dottyville , The Hydra served as a platform for patients to express their creativity. Sassoon s poem  Dreamers  was first published in its pages, and Owen s poems  Dulce et Decorum est  and  Anthem for Doomed Youth  were written during his time at the hospital. The Hydra was, and still is, a valuable document for understanding the inner lives of those suffering from shell shock and seeking psychological amelioration through the arts. It also enabled patients to showcase their creative interpretations of the war to a wider audience. The team behind the magazine was aware of this and delighted in it: one editorial proclaimed,  The Hydra has already acquired a footing in the world outside, and when we found a copy reposing bashfully in a hairdresser s shop we were overcome with joy.  Craiglockhart is thought to be a key hospital in revolutionising mental health care after the First World War and the double outcome of The Hydra   in its advocating of patient care and its prioritising of patients  voices   played an important role in this. Through The Hydra, patients could unite their voices with others advocating change. The historian Tracey Loughran has suggested that shell shock provided a powerful impetus for reform of the mental health care system, demonstrating a need for effective and immediate treatment for those suffering from what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder. Although there was a strong movement for reform, the Mental Treatment Act, which made provision for voluntary treatment at outpatient clinics, was not passed until 1930. Likewise, despite this prominent challenge to the government s inadequate mental health care facilities, it appears that attitudes within the military did not change. Institutional improvements were very slow, which meant that individual doctors had to carry the lessons learned from helping shell-shocked patients into their postwar careers. Mental health was not a priority for the government, nor did military authorities maintain a psychiatric service, despite the fact that 80,000 officers and ordinary soldiers had suffered a debilitating mental disability by the end of the war. Today s system for providing mental health care is much more robust and it is recognised that creativity can play a key role in psychological wellbeing. This, however, is jeopardised by continuous cuts to arts funding and to the National Health Service. April 28th marks 100 years since the first publication of The Hydra and it is worth using this centenary to think about the battles which have been fought over the last century to advance understanding of, and provision for, mental health care. Emily Turner is a PhD student at the University of Sussex, researching creativity in mental health.",
        "target_summary": "During the First World War, specialist hospitals were established to treat shell shock, employing \"ergotherapy\"—a precursor to modern occupational therapy—which emphasized activity and work for mental well-being. This therapeutic approach, rooted in 18th-century reforms by William Battie, shifted mental health care towards humane treatment and moral discipline, notably prioritizing creative expression alongside regimen and recreation. By the 19th century, sanatoria encouraged patients to engage in arts like painting and writing, leading to patient-led hospital magazines.\n\nA prime example was *The Hydra*, launched in 1917 at Craiglockhart War Hospital, a military psychiatric facility in Edinburgh. Its name, referencing both hydrotherapy and the multi-headed monster of Greek mythology, carried a darkly humorous nod to the trauma suffered by soldiers. This magazine became a vital therapeutic platform, edited by Wilfred Owen and featuring poems by Siegfried Sassoon, including Owen's iconic \"Dulce et Decorum est\" and \"Anthem for Doomed Youth.\" It provided a powerful outlet for soldiers to express their inner lives and experiences of war, gaining recognition beyond the hospital walls.\n\n*The Hydra* and Craiglockhart were pivotal in advocating for patient-centered care and prioritizing patient voices, significantly influencing post-WW1 mental health reform. Historians suggest that shell shock provided a potent catalyst for systemic change, highlighting the urgent need for effective treatment for what is now understood as post-traumatic stress disorder. However, despite this advocacy, institutional improvements were slow; the Mental Treatment Act, for instance, wasn't passed until 1930, and military attitudes largely remained unchanged.\n\nToday, while mental health care is more robust and recognizes the importance of creativity, it faces threats from continuous cuts to arts and healthcare funding. The centenary of *The Hydra*'s first publication serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring struggle to advance understanding and provision for mental health, underscoring the vital role of creative expression in healing and advocacy.",

A Japanese teenager named Manjir , from an impoverished family in a tiny fishing village, found himself thrust into a struggle for survival after being shipwrecked on a Pacific atoll in 1841. Following a dramatic maritime rescue, Manjir  was catapulted into a decade-long series of adventures in which he became the first Japanese known to have lived in the United States, circumnavigated the globe and then participated in the California Gold Rush. Yet Manjir  never lost his desire to return home to  closed , isolationist Japan. After a daring effort at repatriation, his knowledge of the United States made him a valuable resource for his native government at the moment that Japan faced the dilemma of  opening  to the West. His story and its significance have been overlooked, but Manjir  (Japanese commoners at that time rarely had surnames) played an integral role in Japan s relations with the West and its transformation into a  modernised  state in the second half of the 19th century.

        "content": "The First World War centenary gave us a better understanding of the vast contribution made by the Indian Army to that conflict. The focus, though, was on the soldiers and little was made of the thousands of Indians who travelled to France and Mesopotamia as  followers  and labourers   mule drivers, sweepers, stretcher-bearers, porters and construction workers. Few could write so their story can seem impossible to recover. This gap has now been filled by Radhika Singha, a professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, who has devoted nearly a decade to researching the Indian Labour Corps (ILC). Her thoughtful, meticulous history is sobering in what it reveals. Of the 1.4 million Indians recruited up to the end of 1919, 563,369 were non-combatants. Many were from the frontier hill states of Assam, Bihar and Orissa. There were strong inducements to join up: those who volunteered became exempt for life from an onerous house tax and any further labour obligations. For some, the prospect of returning to India with funds to marry may have been attractive. For others there may have been a sense of adventure. On arrival in Mesopotamia, canals needed to be deepened and extended, roads built and railway lines laid down, all in blistering heat. Singha has mined regional archives, official reports, unit diaries and private accounts to piece together stories of impossibly long hours, punishing journeys on foot to remote worksites and lack of proper equipment and clothing. Lieutenant Maynard Knight, a tea planter commanding a detachment of the 1st Madras Labour Corps, reported that a great number of his men, their hands cut and bruised through work on the Khanikin railway, had  no boots at all, and only one blanket a piece . Desertion was at first punished by flogging, but seeing potential issues, the military instead set up  disciplinary camps  surrounded by barbed wire. There was at one point an urgent need for sanitation workers and the authorities turned to Indian jails for this dangerously unhygienic work. Prisoners were recruited with  suspicious swiftness . Travelling by train to Bombay, the newly enlisted men of the 5th United Provinces Jail Porter Corps pulled the communication cord no fewer than seven times and by the end of the journey seven of them were missing. Deployed in France from 1917 onwards, the ILC found the long sea route to Marseilles bewildering and traumatic. Overcrowding led to dysentery and, to the recruits  great distress, some of their companions had to be buried at sea. The labourers were put to work clearing the battlefields of the Western Front. Lord Ampthill, former Governor of Madras, wondered how men  from the hills and jungles, who have barely emerged from barbarism  would shape up as labour. Not long after, Ampthill was admitting to a colleague the dangers these men faced:  Mills bombs lurk in the grass and explode at a touch.  Two Jesuit priests travelled with the ILC and observed them clearing the Somme battlefields: Every five yards we come across bones still wrapped up in their putties, arms and legs blown off by shell-fire. One of our old Ranchi boys had his heart full and stood by weeping. The Park of Thiepval is covered with human remains. Throughout this story of exploitation, Singha s tone is measured, just occasionally describing her reactions to sources. Through faint but poignant traces, the lives of the ILC open up to the reader.

        "target_summary": "While the First World War centenary brought the contributions of Indian soldiers into sharper focus, the vast, often harrowing experiences of the hundreds of thousands of Indian non-combatant labourers remained largely untold.

        "content": "It is difficult to forget a work of history that begins with a discussion of the author s dental history and ends with a reflection on the beret as symbol of the Vichy regime in France. Perhaps that is why Richard Cobb s French and Germans, Germans and French has stuck with me ever since I first read it as an undergraduate student. Out of print since it was first published in 1983, this unique study of the lived experience of occupation in France during two World Wars has been reissued as a handsome paperback in Penguin s  Modern Classics  series. French and Germans is an idiosyncratic book, but Richard Cobb was an idiosyncratic historian. Primarily known as a specialist of the French Revolution, he began his research career in Paris in the late 1930s before being called up in 1941. Having spent several years at the end of the war as an interpreter based in France, Belgium and Germany, Cobb resumed his decidedly unconventional career in 1946. Appointed to a lectureship at Aberystwyth in 1955, he proudly advertised his second, French, identity, publishing primarily in French until the late 1960s. For Cobb, a true understanding of history could not be achieved through archival research alone. Rather, in the historian David Gilmour s words, it had to be  walked, observed, smelt, drunk  in Paris and elsewhere. Cobb s study of France under occupation was published towards the end of his academic career, appearing in the same year as the first volume of his memoirs, Still Life: Sketches from a Tunbridge Wells Childhood. The book began life as a series of lectures on occupied France delivered in Britain and America, each one fuelled by a pint of Guinness, which Cobb sipped throughout as he warmed to his theme. French and Germans is not the product of the kind of marathon archival research that underpins much of Cobb s other work   nor does it pretend to be. Cobb described the book as  a personal interpretation , a provocation to further research rather than the last word on the subject. The book is divided into two parts: a single chapter on occupants and occup s in the department of the Nord during the First World War and four more substantial chapters on occupation and collaboration between 1940 and 1944. Cobb s evocative, if sometimes meandering, reflections draw on a range of material, including newspapers, memoirs, novels and personal recollections, as well as the historian s own imagination. Cobb was not afraid to acknowledge the part played by his own experience of France at war in shaping his historical reflections. As he saw it, it was impossible  to divorce history from experience . Cobb s book was a response to a significant shift in historical and cultural understandings of the Occupation and the Vichy regime, which began in the late 1960s. The French filmmaker Marcel Ophuls  seminal 1969 documentary The Sorrow and the Pity revealed the complexity of collaboration and resistance in the town of Clermont-Ferrand. The film inaugurated what the French historian Henry Rousso would later describe as the  broken mirror , as the old certainties of de Gaulle s  eternal France  were challenged. Instead of a nation united in resistance to the occupier and the illegitimate Vichy government, a rather different picture of wartime France began to emerge. As Cobb notes in the bibliographical essay at the end of French and Germans, work by Anglophone scholars was central to this shift. Among them were Robert Paxton, whose 1972 book Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order sent shockwaves through France and demonstrated the scale of willing collaboration between Vichy and the Nazis; and Rod Kedward, whose 1978 work Resistance in Vichy France marked a turning point in the historiography of the French Resistance. What marks French and Germans as a classic work of history, above all, is its evocation of occupation on a human scale. Cobb was always a historian of individuals, insisting that the past could only be properly understood  in terms of human relationships . This approach is at the heart of French and Germans, and gives the book warmth and intimacy. Cobb is at his best when conveying the complex relationships and interactions between the occupiers and occupied through glimpses (sometimes imagined) of their shared existence. Cobb imagines a working-class French woman in a relationship with a German soldier, waking in the night in the spring of 1918, noticing  his leather belt (with Gott Mit Uns clasp) , and hearing  the continuous rumble  in the distance. Cobb is sensitive in his handling of women and their children born  to an unknown father . For Cobb, therefore, there can be no simplistic oppositions in understanding the experience of occupation in 20th-century France. As he shows, for most Frenchmen and women the overwhelming response to occupation was what Henry Rousso would later characterise as attentisme: wait and see. Did waiting and seeing equate to collaboration with the occupying Nazis? Cobb reminds us that  collaboration is an endlessly elastic concept .  Was anyone who worked, directly or indirectly, for the Germans a collaborator? , he asks. What of the Paris M tro driver, continuing to do his job even as he knew that his train carried  German, as well as French, passengers, wedged fraternally like   sardines?  Occupation was lived not in black and white, but shades of grey. There has been much historiographical water under the bridge since French and Germans first appeared in 1983. New evidence and innovative approaches by successive generations of historians have ensured the study of France under occupation remains vital, exciting and often provocative. There is still a place, however, for Cobb s distinctive voice. At the start of the book, he states that his main concern is that  the present study   should make enjoyable reading .

        "target_summary": "Richard Cobb's *French and Germans, Germans and French*, a remarkably idiosyncratic yet deeply insightful historical work, has been reissued in Penguin's Modern Classics series, ensuring its continued relevance. First published in 1983, this unique study delves into the lived experience of occupation in France during both World Wars, offering a perspective as unconventional as its author. Cobb, primarily known for his work on the French Revolution, was a historian who believed that true understanding transcended mere archival research, advocating for history to be \"walked, observed, smelt, drunk.\"\n\nHis personal interpretation of France under occupation, developed from lectures fuelled by Guinness, is not a product of marathon archival deep-dives but rather a \"provocation to further research.\" The book covers the department of the Nord during WWI and expands to the 1940-1944 period, drawing on an eclectic mix of newspapers, memoirs, novels, and his own experiences and imagination. Cobb was unapologetic about the role of his personal connection to wartime France in shaping his reflections, seeing history and experience as inseparable.\n\n*French and Germans* emerged at a pivotal moment in historical scholarship, contributing significantly to the evolving understanding of the Occupation and the Vichy regime. Following works like Marcel Ophuls' *The Sorrow and the Pity* and groundbreaking studies by Anglophone scholars such as Robert Paxton and Rod Kedward, Cobb's book further challenged the myth of a unified, resistant \"eternal France,\" revealing a more complex reality of collaboration and nuanced responses.\n\nThe book's enduring power lies in its masterful evocation of occupation on a profoundly human scale. Cobb, a historian of individuals, meticulously portrays the intricate human relationships between occupiers and occupied, eschewing simplistic dichotomies. Through evocative, sometimes imagined, glimpses—like a French woman sharing a bed with a German soldier or a Metro driver continuing his route despite carrying German passengers—he reveals the \"shades of grey\" in daily life. He sensitively explores concepts like \"attentisme\" (wait and see) and the \"endlessly elastic concept\" of collaboration, showing that for many, survival meant navigating morally ambiguous territory rather than clear-cut resistance or complicity.\n\nDespite subsequent decades of new research and methodologies, Cobb's distinctive, reflective, and often provocative voice retains its vital place in historiography. His primary aim was to make history \"enjoyable reading,\" but *French and Germans* achieves far more, serving as a powerful reminder against complacency and challenging readers to confront the difficult lessons of the past. As Cobb himself warned, \"Let us not be deceived into believing...that the history of Vichy...has nothing to teach us.\"",

        "content": "With biographies of all the big-name poets of the Great War (with the exception of Wilfred Owen) to her name, Jean Moorcroft Wilson has established herself as the foremost authority on a subject that increasingly informs the way Britain s public views the conflict as a whole. Seeing the war through the prism of these writers of pity and protest may be a distorting mirror, but given the increasingly pacific nature of our society, the view of the war poets may come to be posterity s settled verdict on the struggle. With this weighty volume, which covers Graves  early life, his war experiences and the troubled postwar decade that led up to the publication of his autobiography, Goodbye to All That   hastily written as a money-making potboiler, but now probably the best-known account by a frontline officer   Wilson has again chalked up a formidable achievement. Her special gift is to integrate a penetrating critique of the poetry into her narrative of the life that gave birth to it. In Graves  case this is particularly important as he first suppressed, then neglected the poems he wrote in the trenches, feeling that they were not worthy of his later elevated bardic view of his muse. In fact, many of the poems rediscovered by Wilson are not bad at all and she does Graves  reputation a favour by resurrecting them. Born in the London suburb of Wimbledon to an elderly Irish father and a German mother, Graves grew up in an intellectual atmosphere, amid a tribe of siblings. Bullied at his public school, Charterhouse, he reacted by becoming a boxer and fighting back. About to go up to Oxford, the outbreak of war found him at his family s holiday home in Harlech, North Wales. He enlisted immediately in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Wilson   unafraid to criticise her subject   makes it very clear that Graves was an unpopular officer. His slovenly, individualistic ways defied the army s attempt to force him into a conformist mould. Salvation came in the form of his friendship with Siegfried Sassoon, when his fellow poet joined the same regiment. Though they later fell out over the fibs and inaccuracies in Graves  memoirs, the relationship was crucial to both men, not least when Graves defended his friend after Sassoon protested against the war. Desperately wounded on the Somme, Graves ended the war a nervous and physical wreck. His first marriage ended when he fell under the spell of the poet and essayist Laura Riding. By then he had found his true metier: as a poet. Graves  eventful life and colourful personality has attracted several biographers. Wilson pays him the compliment of treating him as a son, brother, lover, soldier and war victim, but above all as one of Britain s greatest modern writers.

        "target_summary": "Jean Moorcroft Wilson, a preeminent authority on Great War poets, deeply shapes public understanding of the conflict by viewing it through the prism of these writers of pity and protest. Her latest, weighty biography delves into the eventful life of Robert Graves, meticulously chronicling his early years, harrowing wartime experiences, and the tumultuous postwar decade that led to his iconic autobiography, \"Goodbye to All That.\" Wilson's singular talent lies in seamlessly weaving incisive poetic analysis into the life story that birthed it—a crucial approach given Graves's later dismissal of his own trench poems. Wilson judiciously resurrects many of these unfairly neglected works, significantly bolstering his literary standing.\n\nBorn into an intellectual London household, the bullied Charterhouse student who found solace in boxing, Graves immediately enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers upon the war's outbreak. Wilson candidly portrays him as an unpopular, individualistic officer, whose saving grace arrived with his crucial friendship with Siegfried Sassoon. Their pivotal bond, forged in shared regiment and intellectual camaraderie, proved invaluable when Graves staunchly defended Sassoon's anti-war protest. Severely wounded on the Somme, Graves emerged from the war a shattered man, both physically and psychologically. His first marriage dissolved as he embarked on a new poetic journey with Laura Riding, having finally embraced his true calling as a poet. Wilson's biography honors Graves not merely as a complex figure—son, soldier, lover—but, above all, as one of Britain's most significant modern writers, offering a penetrating portrait of his eventful life and colourful personality.",

On one level, this makes sense. Aside from the occasional inspiring story of self-sacrifice, only fools and knaves find much to celebrate in war and each generation has a duty to warn the next of its evil. Over the last four years, however, it has been easy to forget that this was not a war in which there were no victors. Few in Britain or France during the 1920s and 1930s, whatever their struggles, would ever have wished to exchange places with their counterparts in the states roiled by violence, revolution and worse that succeeded imperial Germany, Austria-Hungary and tsarist Russia. Better not to fight, but if you must fight, then it is better to win. In 1918 the British found themselves on the victorious side of the largest and most complex war to date. How did they get there?",

        "content": "More than three years after the outbreak of the First World War, on February 3rd, 1917, the recently appointed Food Controller, Lord Devonport, announced the first government- system of food control. Unlike Germany, which had introduced rationing early in the conflict, there was a reluctance to do so in Britain, as it went against the prevailing Liberal principles of free trade. Instead, responsibility for food was delegated to the Board of Trade, which saw the answer to the food problem in the maintenance of a steady supply of imports rather than restrictions. Newspapers and periodicals carried notices appealing to the patriotism of British consumers. The Daily Mail and several other publications printed the same article on different dates in August 1914 on war economy, proclaiming that:  It has become a patriotic duty as well as a wise precaution to reduce expenditure all round, to jettison luxury in money, food, fuel and the rest.  Although the term war ration was used from early on, there was no official line on what this might mean. Instead, there was an expectation that patriotism would guide consumers only to buy what they needed and not as much as they could afford. Furthermore, there was little action taken against rising prices   an increase of 65 per cent between summer 1914 and summer 1916   and there were no official measures ensuring equitable distribution of food. It was argued that problems in the food supply were not caused by disruptions to imports but that people were being unpatriotic and wasteful in their consumption. In consequence, the Robertson Committee, led by John M. Robertson, Liberal MP for Tyneside and, until 1915, parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade, was set up to examine the situation. It concluded that, contrary to the arguments of the Board of Trade, the war was responsible for shortages, both in terms of declining imports and the increased requirements of the army. Following this report, the government relented and in October 1916 a Food Department was established within the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. As late as November 1916, however, the Asquith coalition was rejecting the need for a Food Controller. want orders, not requests. It might be a finer thing if each individual did her bit in the economy line without compulsion, but it s human nature that we don t.  This growing discontent with the availability of food undoubtedly contributed to the collapse of Asquith s government and one of the first items on the agenda of the new government under David Lloyd George was the appointment of Hudson Kearley Ewbanke, Lord Devonport,as Food Controller at the new Ministry of Food. There had been a poor harvest worldwide in 1916, reducing the amount of grain available for both human and animal consumption; the reduced levels of food for animals in turn caused a decline in the levels of meat and dairy products. Coupled with an increasing German U-Boat campaign, which caused difficulties for the importing of food, the supply situation in Britain was declining rapidly. An article in the popular women s periodical Home Chat in December 1916 encapsulated the frustrations of consumers. Entitled  Why Don t They Make Us Do It? , the author, Hilda M. Love, argued:  We want orders, not requests. It might be a finer thing if each individual did her bit in the economy line without compulsion, but it s human nature that we don t.  This growing discontent with the availability of food undoubtedly contributed to the collapse of Asquith s government and one of the first items on the agenda of the new government under David Lloyd George was the appointment of Hudson Kearley Ewbanke, Lord Devonport, as Food Controller at the new Ministry of Food. One of the first actions by Lord Devonport was to implement a system of voluntary rationing with officially prescribed limits. Hilda M. Love s follow up article in Home Chat,  Coming out Strong , published in the week before the announcement, celebrated this development, saying:  We women have asked for restrictions, have said we would welcome anything to aid a speedy victory, and we ve now got as good as we asked for.  In his announcement of February 3rd, 1915, which was carried in full in The Times and summarised in other national newspapers, Devonport once again appealed to the patriotism of consumers: Economy is not only a patriotic duty, but a necessity. Extravagance is obviously unpatriotic. The power to purchase does not constitute the right, and nobody should obtain more than is necessary. Frugality practised at home will ensure a sufficient supply for all, despite any effort of the enemy. There were now official recommendations for consumption. Each person was asked to limit their purchase of three staple foods to prescribed amounts: 2 lb of meat,  lb of sugar and 4lb of bread, per head per week. These were only suggested amounts, however. Captain Bathurst, Devonport s parliamentary secretary, pointed out that the ration was only  intended to be an average and it is left to the general public to observe the average in the spirit of the appeal . George V and the royal family announced they would be adhering to these restrictions and a royal proclamation was issued. Householders were encouraged to sign this King s Pledge and in return they were promised a metal  ration badge , which could be worn on the lapel as a public display of their patriotism. The pledge scheme proved so popular that there were not enough badges and a purple ribbon pin was issued instead. No doubt those who signed up to the pledge had some intention of adhering to it but ultimately Devonport s voluntary rationing programme did little but put off the introduction of compulsory rationing for another year. It was only with reluctance that Devonport proposed an outline scheme for rationing but by that stage the public and the government had lost confidence in his ability to manage the situation and he resigned in May 1917. His successor, Lord Rhonnda, persisted with voluntary rationing until February 1918, when bread, butter, meat and sugar consumption were controlled. Appealing to patriotism could only go so far   as  A Little Bird  joked in the magazine Woman s Life:  Have you heard the best method for testing one s patriotism? It is this: get yourself weighed: if you are steadily losing, you can indeed claim to be a true patriot.

        "title": "Ireland: Easter Rising or Great War?",
        "content": "In May 1916 the young Dubliner Se n Heuston was sentenced to death for his participation in the Irish Easter Rising of that year. The night before his execution he wrote to his sister and touched upon how he and his colleagues might be judged: Let there be no talk of foolish enterprise. I have no vain regrets. Think of the thousands of Irishmen who fell fighting under another flag at the Dardanelles. Thousands of Heuston s contemporaries were killed or wounded when the 10th (Irish) Division landed at Gallipoli in 1915; it is a little reminder that Heuston and the others who fought in the Easter Rising lived in a world shaped by the Great War, which conditioned their own actions. The centenary of the outbreak of the First World War generated great public interest in Ireland. The Irish involvement in the Gallipoli campaign is being marked in a variety of ways. Last November the Irish government announced its plans for the impending centenary of the Easter Rising of 1916. The emphasis on 1916 arises from the fact that it was the catalyst for the independence movement   Sinn F in and the IRA   that led to the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922. With the foundation of the Free State a substantial portion of the United Kingdom broke away from the whole in an unprecedented manner; it is of obvious relevance in the light of last year s Scottish referendum. There is still a tendency to view the Easter Rising and the First World War as distinct events, even if someone like Heuston did not. This is understandable on one level: the Irish involvement in the First World War (210,000 volunteers and 35,000 deaths) overwhelmingly took place in the British armed forces: an unlikely bedfellow for a tradition of resistance to British rule. But the First World War was fundamental to the growth and development of the Irish independence movement, especially in relation to the Easter Rising. The separatist republicans who planned and executed the rising did so within the context of a war that gave them both an opportunity and a prospective ally: Germany. The British suppressed it in the manner in which they did precisely because they were at war and feared the potential for German involvement in such an insurrection. Some Irish responses to 1916 were surprisingly hostile, especially on the part of the families of serving troops. Many Irish soldiers were involved in suppressing the rebellion and the Easter Rising cannot be understood outside the context of the British war effort. Among the British and Irish fatalities of the Great War are those troops who were killed when the Great War came to Dublin for a week in April 1916. Many of them are still buried there. The approach to a number of centenaries up to 2022 has seen a greater recognition on the part of the Irish government of the experiences of Irishmen who fought in the First World War, along with a increased, albeit cautious, British official engagement with the reality of the Irish independence movement. The speech by Britain s Minister for International Security Strategy, Andrew Murrison, in Cork on January 24th, 2014, was a natural follow-on from the symbolism of the state visit to Ireland of the Queen in 2011. Yet while one can be respectful of differing viewpoints, it is also right to caution against the creation of a contrived historical consensus about events that might not be compatible in ideological terms. This was pointed out by the Irish government s Expert Advisory group on commemorations: the Irish state can hardly be neutral about its origins in 1916. Yet there are lives that straddled a range of experiences to make one think how the Irish independence movement and the First World War are intertwined. Take, for instance, Michael McCabe, who fought in the Easter Rising as a member of the Irish Volunteers; served in the British army from 1917 to 1922; fought against the Irish Free State as a member of the IRA in the Irish Civil War; yet, when applying for his IRA pension in 1938, did so as a member of the 2nd Battalion, Gold Coast Regiment, Royal West African Frontier Force. Does his life point to a  shared  history, or to distinct histories, inextricably linked? Ireland was not the only small European country to gain independence from a larger one in the era of the First World War; the difference is that it was a rare instance of a country gaining independence from a victorious power. The creation of the Irish Free State is the single most fundamental change to the UK since it was created. That alone makes the events that led to it worth looking at anew from a British perspective. John Gibney is the editor of www.decadeofcentenaries.com.",
        "target_summary": "In May 1916, as Seán Heuston faced execution for his role in Ireland's Easter Rising, his final letter revealed a profound awareness of the Great War's pervasive influence, likening his \"foolish enterprise\" to the thousands of Irishmen who had perished fighting for the British Empire at Gallipoli. This poignant comparison underscores how the First World War fundamentally shaped the world and actions of the Rising's participants. Centenary commemorations of both the First World War and the Easter Rising have rekindled public interest, particularly in the Irish sacrifices at Gallipoli and the Rising's pivotal role as the catalyst for Irish independence. This historic uprising directly led to the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, marking an unprecedented and significant dissolution of a substantial part of the United Kingdom, a historical echo relevant even to contemporary discussions of national autonomy like the Scottish referendum.\n\nWhile a common tendency exists to view the Easter Rising and the First World War as distinct historical events, the two are, in fact, profoundly intertwined. Despite the vast numbers of Irishmen who volunteered for the British armed forces (210,000, with 35,000 fatalities) – seemingly at odds with a tradition of resistance to British rule – the global conflict provided a unique opportunity for separatist republicans, offering British preoccupation and a potential German alliance. The British, fearing German involvement, suppressed the Rising with exceptional severity precisely because they were embroiled in a world war. Irish responses to the Rising were complex, with some families of serving troops reacting with hostility, and Irish soldiers even participating in its suppression, illustrating its deep connection to the broader British war effort. Indeed, the Great War's casualties included those who fell when the conflict briefly erupted in Dublin in April 1916.\n\nApproaching these centenaries, the Irish government has increasingly recognized the experiences of Irish First World War combatants, while Britain has cautiously engaged with the history of Irish independence through diplomatic gestures. Yet, a caution remains against forging a \"contrived historical consensus\" that might obscure genuine ideological differences, acknowledging the Irish state's foundational origins in 1916. Nevertheless, the complexities of individual lives, such as Michael McCabe – an Easter Rising participant who later served in the British army, fought against the Free State, and eventually drew a pension from a British regiment – powerfully demonstrate how these seemingly disparate histories are, in reality, inextricably linked. Ireland's achievement of independence from a victorious Great Power during WWI was a rare historical event, making the creation of the Irish Free State the most fundamental transformation of the United Kingdom since its very inception, thus compelling a fresh examination of these pivotal events from a modern British perspective.",

        "title": "Pacifism and Feminism in the Great War",
        "content": "More than 1,100 women from warring and neutral states gathered at The Hague in April 1915 for a special set of peace negotiations. They were not diplomats representing states, and they were not present to press national demands. Most were unable even to vote in parliamentary elections in their own countries. They were feminists and pacifists, and it was their commitment to these twin ideals that drew them together as conflict raged across Europe. Their vision of a peace founded on gender equality, social justice and human rights did not bring the war to a close. Nor was it embraced by the male powerbrokers meeting in Paris in 1919 to conclude peace terms. Yet the 1915 International Congress of Women is important because it reminds us that the First World War not only mobilised armies but nurtured alternative forms of politics, not least the politics of international cooperation and peace. Who were the women at The Hague? They were mainly middle-class, well-travelled and experienced feminist activists, many with professional backgrounds and all advocates of women s suffrage. They included the British lawyer Chrystal Macmillan, Aletta Jacobs, the pioneering Dutch physician, the Hungarian feminist Rosika Schwimmer and the trade unionist Lida Gustava Heymann of Germany. The US peace campaigner Jane Addams agreed to preside as chair of the Congress. Many travelled to the Netherlands at personal cost, encountering hostility from the patriotic publics of the belligerent nations. In Britain, anti-war campaigners were placed under official surveillance. As a result, only 20 of the 180-strong British delegation were issued with passports, and even they found it impossible to cross the North Sea due to military operations. The three British women who reached The Hague had either travelled some weeks earlier or went by a different route. Taking a stand against the war was, furthermore, a difficult experience emotionally for many of the delegates. They found themselves in conflict with suffragist comrades who chose a different course, seeing the war as an opportunity to prove themselves loyal citizens and hence convince their respective governments to grant women the vote. After four days of discussions and debates, the Congress agreed a set of 20 resolutions encompassing practical proposals for immediate negotiations to end the war, as well as fundamental principles for a permanent peace. Among the latter were the right of self-determination for all peoples; the creation of an international authority to arbitrate disputes and advance constructive cooperation between nations; and an end to  secret diplomacy  conducted behind closed doors and without democratic accountability. International Congress of Women in session, 1915. Rosika Schwinner fourth from the left, Jane Addams sixth, Aletta Jacobs eighth, and Chrystal Macmillan ninth. LSE Library. Public Domain. Women s rights were central to this blueprint. All delegates wishing to attend were required from the outset to pledge their support for women s suffrage, which the Congress organisers saw as inseparable from the objective of peace. A just world free of conflict, they argued, was impossible to achieve unless women were allowed to take their place alongside men as equal citizens. Enfranchisement, they claimed, would make peace more likely because of the role that women played as mothers in creating the life which war extinguished. Women, in the words of Jane Addams,  who have brought men into the world and nurtured them until they reach the age for fighting, must experience a peculiar revulsion when they see them destroyed, irrespective of the country in which these men may have been born . Despite the efforts of Addams and others to win support for their proposals after the Congress had closed, both women and their concerns were marginal to the negotiations in Paris in 1919, led by the victorious powers. Not one woman was appointed as a formal representative of her nation at the Peace Conference and while a small contingent of feminists travelled to Paris to lobby the official delegates, their demands fell on deaf ears. The US President, Woodrow Wilson, briefly raised the question of women s political representation with his fellow plenipotentiaries, but few wished to see women s rights recognised as a legitimate matter for international agreement. Where the Hague women saw peace and gender equality as fundamentally interlinked, the great powers in Paris were anxious to keep them separate, with women s citizenship firmly under the control of national governments. Given this failure, why is it worth remembering the 1915 Women s Congress at The Hague? The history of seemingly lost causes can tell us a great deal about how power works and, in this case, why women remained peripheral to international politics and diplomacy for so much of the 20th century. Today, the United Nations Security Council passes resolutions about women s inclusion in conflict resolution; governments host summits on rape as a weapon of war; and powerful non-governmental organisations ensure women are given a voice in debates about human rights, development and security. But history shows us that these achievements have been hard fought and won. They stand as testament to the efforts of generations of feminists who worked to make women s rights an international, and not just a national, concern. It would be too simplistic to draw a line of continuity between the Women s Congress of 1915 and today s policy debates. Much took place in the interim to reconfigure the global women s rights agenda, from interwar Fascism and the Cold War to the fall of European empires and the rise of new superpowers at the century s end. Nonetheless, at this moment when the legacy of the First World War is uppermost in the public mind, it is worth reflecting on how that conflict produced, through the voices of the women who gathered at The Hague, an analysis of the modern world in which gender equality, social justice and peace were intertwined.

These were not state diplomats but dedicated feminists and pacifists from both warring and neutral nations, many disenfranchised in their own countries, united by a profound vision for peace rooted in gender equality, social justice, and human rights.\n\nThis pioneering International Congress of Women drew largely middle-class, well-travelled activists and suffrage advocates, including figures like Chrystal Macmillan, Aletta Jacobs, Rosika Schwimmer, and chair Jane Addams. Their journey to the Netherlands was often arduous and costly, marked by hostility from patriotic publics, official surveillance, and severe travel restrictions that prevented many from attending. Furthermore, their anti-war stance created a poignant division with some suffragist comrades who saw the conflict as a means to prove national loyalty and win the vote.\n\nOver four days, the Congress formulated 20 resolutions, proposing both immediate peace negotiations and fundamental principles for lasting global stability. These included the right to self-determination, the creation of an international authority for dispute arbitration, and an end to secret diplomacy. Crucially, women's rights were central to their blueprint, with delegates pledging support for suffrage. They argued that a just and peaceful world was unattainable without women’s equal participation, emphasizing women's unique role as life-givers who experience a profound revulsion to war.\n\nDespite their groundbreaking efforts, their progressive vision did not bring the war to an end and was largely dismissed by the male powerbrokers at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. Women and their concerns remained marginal; no woman was a formal national representative, and feminist lobbyists found their pleas ignored. The great powers deliberately separated peace from gender equality, keeping women's citizenship firmly under national control.\n\nYet, the 1915 Congress holds enduring significance. It demonstrates how the First World War, beyond mobilizing armies, fostered alternative political movements centered on international cooperation and peace. This seemingly \"lost cause\" reveals the historical mechanisms that relegated women to the periphery of international politics for much of the 20th century. While a direct line to today's policies is complex, the Congress laid crucial groundwork. Modern achievements, such as women's inclusion in conflict resolution and human rights debates, stand as a testament to generations of feminists who, like those gathered at The Hague, tirelessly worked to elevate women's rights to an international concern. Their profound analysis—that gender equality, social justice, and peace are intrinsically intertwined—continues to resonate a century later.",

        "title": "Living with the dead? You need to know these 7 gruesome facts about the history of human burial",
        "content": "From the depths of prehistory, human societies have grappled with the same question: how do we treat the dead? Those many varying answers offer a valuable insight into how people across history have understood life, faith and human relationships. Ad From Tutankhamun s tomb to the mysterious Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo, many of the most famous   and culturally significant   historical and archaeological discoveries have centred around the notion of burial. It s for that reason that historian Roger Luckhurst, author of Graveyards: A History of Living with the Dead, thinks that burial practices say as much about the living and their societies, as they do about the dead. In a conversation on the HistoryExtra podcast, Luckhurst shared seven important (and unsettling) facts that trace how our relationship with death has evolved across history. 1. Homo sapiens weren t the first to bury our dead For centuries, archaeologists thought deliberate burial marked the beginning of humanity. Care for the dead, they argued, was the dividing line between Homo sapiens other human species, like Homo heidelbergensis or the Denisovans.  It used to be the case that archaeologists thought that they could identify Homo sapiens by how they cared for their dead,  Luckhurst says.  Actually, there are other versions of [archaic humans] who were burying their dead probably intentionally.  But recent discoveries have challenged that assumption.  | When and why did Neanderthals go extinct? Now, archaeological evidence seems to suggest that other human species, including Neanderthals, carefully laid their dead in shallow graves, possibly alongside flowers. One of the most famous examples is in Spain s Sima de las Palomas archaeological site, where a Neanderthal woman and her child seem to have been buried together, with their bodies positioned in a specific way. Far from the brutish caricature of early humans, Neanderthals may have shared our impulse to mark death as a meaningful part of life. 2. Nations recruit their dead to tell stories about themselves From ancient empires to modern democracies, death has always served politics in the form of monuments and memorials.  If you think about most national narratives, it's nearly always about the sacrifice of the people who founded the modern nation,  says Luckhurst.  In England we have this celebration of Memorial Day in November to mark the Armistice [at the end of the First World War]. And there are monuments in every village and every church for those who died in the two world wars.  Across Europe, the aftermath of the world wars turned graveyards into civic altars. Cenotaphs, war cemeteries and endless rows of white crosses framed sacrifice as the foundation of unity and national image. But the phenomenon of using the dead to tell a broader story extends beyond the West.  In Africa, one of my favourite graveyards is in Zimbabwe,  says Luckhurst,  where the cemetery is shaped like an AK-47 rifle because that's the rifle that the people buried there used as independence fighters   the graves are [shaped like] bullets in the magazine.  3. Lenin s corpse sparked a modern cult of preservation When Vladimir Lenin died in 1924, the newly formed Soviet Union faced a problem: how should its revolutionary hero be memorialised?  He died after the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun,  says Luckhurst,  and the Soviets thought,  There's a preserved body that s laid for thousands of years, why don't we do this with Lenin?  The embalmed body of Vladimir Lenin lies in state, preserved for public viewing after his death in 1924. Displayed in Moscow s Red Square, the Soviet leader s mausoleum became both a shrine to the revolution and a symbol of enduring political power. (Photo by Getty Images) A special laboratory was built beneath Lenin s mausoleum on Red Square, where scientists experimented with chemicals to halt decay. The result was a body that has been preserved for nearly a century, tended to by teams of embalmers who still adjust his features under carefully controlled conditions.  [The Russians] even did this with Ho Chi Minh,  Luckhurst adds,  and kept it hidden for about six years until the Vietnam war was over.  What began as a self-contained Soviet experiment became a Cold War phenomenon, as other communist states adopted the same secular sainthood, embalming leaders from China s Mao Zedong to North Korea s Kim Il-sung. 4. Mummification began long before ancient Egypt The Egyptians made mummification famous, but they weren t the first to use it as a means of caring for their dead.  Mummification is a way of preserving a body by drying it out,  says Luckhurst,  but 2000 years before [ancient Egypt], in Chile there was a culture that was preserving bodies in a different kind of way.  Luckhurst was referring to the Chinchorro culture of coastal Chile and Peru, who as early as 5000 BC carefully prepared their dead with clay masks and natural salts. The region s arid air and saline soil acted as natural preservatives, inspiring deliberate human techniques.  | The pharaohs and dynasties that ruled ancient Egypt Egyptians would later transform that process into a religious art, codified under the Old Kingdom (around 2600 BC) into a 70-day ritual involving resins, oils and linen wrappings. 5. The Catholic world turned bone piles into works of art In medieval and early modern Europe, churchyards filled up quickly. The dead were buried close to sanctified ground, and when space ran out, bones were exhumed to make room for others   leading to the establishment of the ossuary, a monument built to be filled with the bones of the dead. Perhaps the best-known example of an ossuary can be found in the French capital.  Underneath the streets of Paris are hundreds of thousands of skulls,  says Luckhurst.  It's a very Catholic practice and it's designed to help you contemplate death.  In the Catacombs of Paris, six million skeletons were arranged into geometric walls of skulls and femurs. In the Sedlec Ossuary of the Czech Republic, monks turned human bones into chandeliers and coats of arms. Meanwhile, the Capuchin Crypt in Rome displays skeletons posed in niches. These were all intended to show that death was part of salvation s cycle. In the Catacombs of Paris, a man studies a skull by torchlight amid towering stacks of bones. Once part of the city s vast network of quarries, the ossuary now holds the remains of millions of Parisians. (Photo by Getty Images) 6. The Romans built cities of the dead outside their cities of the living Ancient Rome regulated death with remarkable precision. By law, burials were forbidden within city limits, a rule designed to protect both hygiene and sanctity.  They built laws quite quickly that set out that you must bury the dead outside the city limits. And that's where the word  necropolis  comes from,  Luckhurst explains. Along the Via Appia, tombs of senators and freedmen lined the roadside. These necropoleis (literally  cities of the dead ) were public spaces that served as memorials and monuments. Visitors passing through could read inscriptions, admire the sculpture and reflect on the continuity between life and death. 7. Europe s graveyards became dangerously overcrowded By the late Middle Ages, after the disaster of the Black Death, death once again loomed over Europe   and as the population grew, so did the problem.  From the medieval period onwards, some societies decided that they were going to live with the dead, crammed around Christian churches in classic churchyards, but also in the walls or in the crypts of these churches as well. So they started to become part of the architecture in a fundamental way,  says Luckhurst.  But by the 18th century, you start getting a real crisis with people thinking,  What on earth are we going to do with all of these dead?  As cities expanded, burial grounds grew packed. Corpses were layered in shared plots, and decomposing bodies seeped into wells and cellars. In London, decay became a very real public health hazard. It was a crisis that led to reform, and a massive social change. From the early 19th century, the garden cemetery movement transformed burial into something akin to landscape design. New cemeteries such as P re Lachaise in Paris (1804) and Kensal Green in London (1832) created tree-lined avenues and manicured plots that restored order to how the dead were buried. It was a distinct shift. Now, people weren t surrounded by the dead in the cities; the dead were no longer ever-present. Instead, they were separated from the living   out of sight, and, eventually, out of mind. Ad Roger Luckhurst was speaking to Ellie Cawthorne on the HistoryExtra podcast.

        "target_summary": "From the earliest stirrings of human consciousness, societies have grappled with the profound mystery of death, shaping their understanding of life, faith, and human connection through their treatment of the departed. Historian Roger Luckhurst emphasizes that these diverse burial practices reveal as much about the living and their cultures as they do about the deceased, often forming the bedrock of humanity's most significant historical and archaeological discoveries.\n\nChallenging long-held archaeological assumptions, recent discoveries unveil that the solemn ritual of burial was not exclusive to *Homo sapiens*. Neanderthals, far from brutish caricatures, also carefully laid their dead in shallow graves, perhaps even adorned with flowers, suggesting a shared, ancient impulse to imbue death with meaning. Beyond personal grief, the dead are often recruited into grand national narratives, serving as civic altars and symbols of unity. From European war memorials brimming with rows of white crosses, commemorating sacrifice as the foundation of national identity, to Zimbabwe's stark, AK-47 shaped cemetery commemorating independence fighters, death profoundly shapes political remembrance across cultures.\n\nA macabre yet revolutionary impulse emerged with Vladimir Lenin's death in 1924, sparking a modern cult of preservation. Inspired by Tutankhamun's enduring mummy, the Soviet Union meticulously embalmed Lenin, transforming his body into a perpetual symbol of revolutionary power. This secular sainthood became a Cold War phenomenon, with other communist states, from China to North Vietnam, adopting similar practices to immortalize their leaders. While ancient Egypt famously perfected the art of mummification, this intricate preservation technique originated millennia earlier in the Chinchorro culture of coastal Chile and Peru. As early as 5000 BC, their arid environment and saline soils naturally preserved bodies, inspiring deliberate human techniques long before the pharaohs codified it into a religious art.\n\nIn medieval and early modern Catholic Europe, overflowing churchyards led to the striking creation of ossuaries – vast monuments adorned with human remains. From the subterranean labyrinth of Paris's Catacombs, where millions of skeletons form geometric walls of skulls and femurs, to the eerily artistic bone chandeliers of the Sedlec Ossuary, these sites served as stark reminders of mortality and the cycle of salvation. The disciplined Romans meticulously regulated death, forbidding burials within their vibrant cities for both hygienic and sacred reasons. This decree led to the emergence of vast 'necropoleis' or 'cities of the dead' along major roads like the Via Appia, where elaborate tombs and public monuments invited reflection on the continuous journey between life and the afterlife.\n\nBy the late Middle Ages, exacerbated by the devastation of the Black Death, Europe's graveyards faced a dire crisis of overcrowding. Corpses were layered in shared plots, posing severe public health hazards as decomposition seeped into urban life. This grim reality spurred a monumental shift in the 19th century: the garden cemetery movement. Grand, landscaped burial grounds like Père Lachaise in Paris emerged, purposefully separating the deceased from the bustling cities, ushering in an era where the dead were progressively moved 'out of sight, and, eventually, out of mind.' This evolution illustrates humanity's ongoing quest to navigate death, reflecting changing social values, spiritual beliefs, and practical necessities across the ages.",

        "title": "The real Arthur Guinness of House of Guinness And What Happened To Him",
        "content": "Since 1759, when the first Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease on St James s Gate Brewery in Dublin, generations of Guinnesses have grown the business, along with a vast fortune and a family legacy based on philanthropy as much as their stout. Ad House of Guinness, a drama now streaming on Netflix, explores a chapter of that fascinating family history in the way that only Peaky Blinders and SAS Rogue Heroes creator Steven Knight can. Starring a riotously charming Anthony Boyle (of Masters of the Air fame) as Arthur Guinness, the eight-part series bills itself as a 19th-century Succession, complete with sibling rivalries, political intrigue and a rebellious spirit   all mixed down with plenty of pints. Who was the real Arthur Guinness? The Arthur Guinness of House of Guinness is not the one who founded the brewery back in 1759. This is his great-grandson, Arthur Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun. He ran the brewery business alongside his brother Edward from 1868 to 1876, as well as sitting in the House of Commons as an MP and giving generously to a host of humanitarian causes. Born on 1 November 1840 in Dublin, Arthur was the eldest son of Elizabeth and Benjamin Lee Guinness, the man responsible for turning the brewery into a truly global giant. Growing up with two brothers, Benjamin and Edward, and a sister, Anne, he received an elite education at Eton and Trinity College Dublin, graduating in 1862.

(Image by Alamy) During its first three generations, Guinness had become the largest brewery in Ireland and a major exporter to Europe, the Americas and parts of Africa. Under the stewardship of Arthur and his youngest brother, Edward Guinness, the brewery continued to thrive; even the temperance movement, which bemoaned the social ills of alcohol, promoted the stout as a preferred alternative to spirits like gin and whiskey. What was Arthur s involvement in the brewery? For Arthur, 1868 would be a life-changing year, beginning with the death of his father. He was elevated to the title of Baronet Guinness of Ashford, which had been created just a year earlier to mark Benjamin Lee s achievements. His father left a fortune of  1.1 million (well over  100 million today) and the Guinness Brewery, the management of which became a partnership between Arthur and the youngest son, Edward. While the middle brother Benjamin and sister Anne received estates and money, they had no say in the business. In the first decade of their ownership, the success of Guinness only expanded, with sales more than doubling from around 350,000 barrels sold in 1868 to almost 779,000 in 1876. In the decades that followed, it would rise to more than a million a year. Was Arthur Guinness a philanthropist? As a major landowner in rural Ireland, Arthur had hundreds of poor tenants. Although more attentive than many landlords, this got him embroiled in the agrarian unrest and occasional violence of the 1880s, known as the Land War, in which several of his employees were murdered. Generally, though, he was considered a generous and conscientious figure, having learned the creed of the Guinness family to favour philanthropy and social responsibility over greed. Did Arthur Guinness commit election fraud? The year 1868 also saw Arthur s election to the UK Parliament as a Conservative MP for the City of Dublin, the seat previously been held by his father. Only a year later, however, the election was voided when it emerged that Guinness agents had used tactics that amounted to corruption and bribery, even offering  5 for every vote. When the matter went to court, it was concluded that Arthur himself had no idea this had happened.

(Image by Ben Blackall/Netflix) It would be another five years before he could win his seat back, in 1874, when he served under the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli until 1880. This was a time of widening divide in Ireland, between the Unionists who wished to stay part of the United Kingdom and nationalists seeking independence. Religion similarly divided the Irish between Protestant and Catholic.  | Who was to blame for the Irish famine? Arthur was a staunch Unionist and Protestant, as all generations of his family had been. In later life, he bought two Unionist newspapers and supported the Irish Unionist Alliance, and the Guinness Brewery s clear stance was cause for some anger among republicans. In 1880, Arthur left the House of Commons as he was raised to the peerage as Baron Ardilaun. What s known about Arthur Guinness s sexuality? In 1871, Arthur married Lady Olivia Charlotte Hedges-White, daughter of the Earl of Bantry. It seemed to be a happy marriage, although childless. The couple became known for their extravagant hospitality, hosting both Queen Victoria and the future George V, and they travelled widely. According to Joe Joyce, author of 2009 The Guinnesses: The Untold Story of Ireland s Most Successful Family, Arthur was  probably gay . Joyce also reported that both Arthur Guinness and the Baroness Ardilaun were content in maintaining the marriage under the agreement that there would be no sexual intercourse. It s a slender claim that the show has taken to heart and run with to riotous conclusions. Certainly, there was no way that same-sex relationships could have been accepted in tandem with success in public life   male homosexuality was legislated against in UK law, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. \"Sodomy (or buggery) were previously a hanging offence in Britain,\" writes Brian Lewis. \"This was modified by the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which replaced capital punishment with minimum sentences of 10 years  imprisonment. The Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 added to the statute book a two-year maximum penalty for 'gross indecency' between men.\" What happened to Arthur Guinness after the events of House of Guinness? In 1876, Arthur made the decision to step back from the brewery, selling his half of the shares to his brother for nearly  700,000. Although that figure made the younger Guinness a fabulously wealthy man, Edward would float the business a few years later on the London Stock Exchange, which made him a multi-millionaire. Arthur helped restore Marsh s Library and extend the Coombe Hospital in Dublin; he  the building of housing for the poor; and, along with his brother, set up the Dublin Exhibition of Arts and Finance to encourage domestic trade. To this day, people can visit St Stephen s Green, a 22-acre public park that Arthur bought, landscaped and gifted to the city in the 1870s and 80s. Was Arthur Guinness assassinated? No, Arthur Guinness was not assassinated, or ever targeted by a Fenian plot to assassinate him. Arthur died on 20 January 1915, at the age of 74. He would be buried in the Dublin suburb of Raheny at All Saints  Church, the building of which he had helped fund several decades earlier. Ad House of Guinness is streaming on Netflix now.

Educated at elite institutions like Eton and Trinity College Dublin, Arthur stepped into a pivotal role in 1868 after his father's passing. Alongside his younger brother Edward, he skillfully steered the flourishing brewery, witnessing a doubling of sales within their first decade.

        "content": "At the time of her birth, Victoria was never expected to be queen. Yet upon the death of her uncle, King William IV, she succeeded him at the age of 18. She is remembered for her reign that spanned more than six decades, overseeing the expansion of the British empire for almost 64 years. Here are facts you need to know about the diminutive monarch   from her famed love and mourning for her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg, to the many attempts on her life  Ad Victoria was born fifth in line to the throne  Plump as a partridge  more of a pocket Hercules than a pocket Venus , is how the Duke of Kent described his spirited newborn daughter Princess Victoria when she was born on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace. Yet though she went on to become one of Britain s most iconic monarchs, Victoria s birth did not herald national celebration. As the daughter of King George III s fourth son, at the time of her birth Victoria was only fifth in line to the throne. Expected to be just another minor royal relative who would end up married into a European royal family, Victoria s arrival slipped under the radar somewhat. Few could have predicted that she would sit on the throne for more than 60 years. By the time Victoria reached her teens, however, the death of her father, his brothers and any other legitimate heirs left the young princess as King William IV s closest surviving heir. On 24 June 1819, the princess was christened in a low-key ceremony. Frustrated by his own inability to produce a surviving heir, Victoria s uncle, the Prince Regent, only allowed a handful of people to attend. Also under the direction of her uncle, she was given the name  Alexandrina Victoria . At the time, Victoria was far from a regal name   it was highly unusual and of French origin. When it became clear that Victoria would indeed accede to the throne, her name was seen to be completely inappropriate for a queen of England. She was advised to change it to something more traditional, but refused. Victoria as a child. (The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Queen Victoria had an unhappy childhood Victoria spent her formative years at Kensington Palace. However, in many ways the palace proved a prison for the princess, and her childhood there was far from rosy. Following her father s death from pneumonia when she was just eight months old, Victoria s early life was dominated by her mother, the Duchess of Kent, and her ambitious adviser Sir John Conroy. Keen to establish himself as the power behind the throne in the event of a Regency (in which Victoria s mother would rule with her if she acceded while still underage), Conroy sought to keep tight control of the princess. Both he and the Duchess had a hostile relationship with Victoria s uncle, King William, and consequently kept Victoria isolated from the royal court, even preventing her from attending her uncle s coronation. The pair imposed a stifling code of discipline on the young Victoria, which came to be known as the  Kensington System . Along with a strict timetable of lessons to improve her moral and intellectual rigor, this suffocating regime dictated that the princess spent hardly any time with other children and was under constant adult supervision. Right up until the time she became queen, Victoria was forced to share a bedroom with her mother. She was forbidden from ever being alone, or even walking down stairs without someone holding her hand. Later in life, Victoria reflected that she  led a very unhappy life as a child  and did not know what a happy domestic life was . She retained a deep-seated hatred of John Conroy for manipulating her mother and imposing such rigid rules on her, later describing him as  demon incarnate . Victoria was only 18 when she became queen  I went into my sitting room (only in my dressing gown) alone and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at twelve minutes past two this morning and consequently that I was Queen.  This is how Victoria recalled the moment that would change her life forever. At 6am on 20 June 1837, the young princess was woken from her bed to be informed that her uncle, King William IV, had died during the night. This meant that Victoria, who was only 18 at the time, was now queen of England. Although it came as a shock, Victoria took the news extremely stoically. Despite her young age she remained calm and had no need for the smelling salts her governess had prepared for her. In her first meeting with her privy council just a few hours later, Victoria s new ministers towered over her   at just 4ft 11, she had to be seated on a raised platform in order to be seen. What Victoria lacked in height, however, she made up for in determination, and she quickly made a favourable impression. A portrait of the young Queen Victoria by Franz Winterhalter. (Leemage/Corbis via Getty Images) Victoria had turned 18 less than a month before acceding to the throne. This was a crucial milestone, as it meant that she was able to rule under her own steam, rather than alongside her mother in a regency. She began her new life by moving away from her childhood home at Kensington to Buckingham Palace, in part to escape from the controlling influence of Conroy and her mother. Her relationship with her mother remained strained and distant for many years and she limited Conroy s influence at court. Just two years after Victoria took the throne, he resigned his post and left for Italy amid shame and scandal. In June the following year, Victoria was crowned in a five-hour-long ceremony at Westminster Abbey followed by a royal banquet and fireworks.

Victoria met the German prince at Kensington Palace when the pair were both just 17. The meeting of Victoria and Albert, who were also first cousins, had been masterminded by Victoria s uncle, Leopold I of Belgium, who believed he could benefit politically from the match. Yet despite the marriage brokering that had led the couple to meet, this was most definitely a love match. Victoria s diary revealed that she found the young prince  extremely handsome . She wrote,  his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful . As royal tradition dictated that no one could propose to a reigning monarch, in October 1839 it was Victoria who proposed to Albert. Victoria's marriage was the first of a reigning queen of England in 286 years Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's wedding, which took place in St James s Palace chapel on 10 February 1840, was the first marriage of a reigning queen of England since Mary I in 1554. Victoria wore an 18-foot-long train carried by 12 bridesmaids and kicked off a modern-day tradition by wearing white. Outside, the nation erupted into huge public celebration. Victoria recorded how she  never saw such crowds of people  they cheered most enthusiastically . She reflected on the event as   the happiest day of my life . Over the course of their 21-year marriage, Victoria and Albert had a passionate, if sometimes tempestuous, relationship. Although the couple had blazing arguments, Victoria clearly adored her husband, describing him in her diary as  perfection in every way   oh how I adore and love him .  about Victoria and Albert's marriage Queen Victoria had nine children  but she hated being pregnant Just over nine months after their wedding, Victoria and Albert s first child, Princess Victoria, was born at Buckingham Palace. The queen soon after recorded how  after a good many hours suffering, a perfect little child was born  but alas! A girl & not a boy, as we both had so hoped & wished for . The royal couple s wishes were granted less than a year later, however, when Victoria gave birth to a male heir: Edward, known by the family as Bertie. Victoria and Albert went on to have a total of nine children   four boys and five girls. Surprisingly, Victoria hated being pregnant, and historians have suggested that she may have suffered from post-natal depression. She compared pregnancy to feeling like a cow and wrote that  an ugly baby is a very nasty object   and the prettiest is frightful when undressed . Many of Victoria s children were married into the royal families of Europe, yet throughout her life she maintained a close, perhaps even suffocating, relationship with them. She had a notoriously fractious relationship with her eldest son, the charismatic yet quick-tempered Bertie. Queen Victoria, her husband Prince Albert, and their nine children.

Yet early in her reign, the inexperienced queen got into hot water for meddling in political matters, in an event termed  The Bedchamber Crisis . The first prime minister of Victoria s reign was the Whig politician Lord Melbourne, with whom she enjoyed a remarkably close relationship. Melbourne held significant sway over the young queen, who appointed the majority of her ladies-in-waiting according to his advice. In 1839, Melbourne resigned following several parliamentary defeats. Tory Robert Peel stepped forward to become prime minister, on one condition: he requested that Victoria dismiss some of her existing household   who largely held Whig sympathies and were loyal to Melbourne   and replace them with Tory ladies. As many of Victoria s ladies-in-waiting were also her closest friends, she took offence at Peel s request and refused. The queen had already been criticised for her over-reliance on Lord Melbourne, and now she was widely condemned for being not just politically partisan, but unconstitutional. The tense situation was eventually defused by the ever-reasonable Prince Albert, who arranged for some of Victoria s ladies to resign their posts voluntarily. Queen Victoria spoke several languages Perhaps in part due to her strict schooling under the  Kensington system , Victoria proved herself to be a remarkably adept linguist. As well as being fluent in both English and German, she also spoke French, Italian and Latin. As her mother and governess both hailed from Germany, Victoria grew up speaking the language and at one stage reportedly even had a German accent, which had to be erased by tutors. When she later married her German cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the couple regularly spoke German together. Although Albert was fluent in English, he and Victoria could often be heard talking   and indeed arguing   in German when in private. Later in life, Victoria also experimented with some of the languages from across her vast empire. Following the arrival of Indian servants at Windsor Castle in August 1887, she was taught Hindustani and Urdu phrases by her favourite Indian attendant, Abdul Karim. The queen recorded in her diary: \"I am learning a few words of Hindustani to speak to my servants. It is a great interest to me for both the language and the people, I have naturally never come into real contact with before\". The queen's relationship with her prime ministers wasn t always easy Over the course of the six decades she sat on the throne, Victoria saw many prime ministers come and go. Yet while she established a remarkably close bond with some, others failed spectacularly to win her favour. Victoria s first prime minister, Lord Melbourne, was keen to flatter, instruct and influence the young queen from the very beginning. The pair were so close that Victoria claimed to love him  like a father . However, this intense friendship with  Lord M  made the queen unpopular with many   she was criticised for being politically partisan and was even mockingly called her  Mrs Melbourne . Later in her reign, Benjamin Disraeli similarly pulled out all the stops to win Victoria s favour with charm and flattery. His tactics clearly worked, as the queen told her eldest daughter [also named Victoria] that he would  do very well  and was  full of poetry, romance and chivalry . Other ministers, however, received a much less enthusiastic response from her majesty: she found Lord John Russell stubborn and rude and referred to Lord Palmerston as a  dreadful old man . As foreign secretary, Palmerston had invoked Victoria s wrath by ignoring Albert s suggested amendments to dispatches and apparently attempting to seduce one of her ladies-in-waiting. Victoria found Gladstone similarly infuriating, and with her characteristically sharp tongue dismissed him as a  half-crazy and in many ways ridiculous, wild and incomprehensible old fanatic . Britain's imperial conquests increased nearly fivefold during Victoria's reign Over the course of her reign, Victoria witnessed a mammoth expansion of the British empire. During her first 20 years on the throne, Britain s imperial conquests had increased almost fivefold. By the time she died, it was the largest empire the world had ever known and included a quarter of the world s population. As the monarchy was seen as a focal point for imperial pride, and a means of uniting the empire s disparate peoples, Victoria s image was spread across the empire. The queen herself took a great interest in imperial affairs. In 1877, prime minister Benjamin Disraeli pronounced her empress of India in a move to cement Britain s link to the  jewel in the empire s crown . The queen had pushed for the title for several years, but, concerned about its absolutist connotations, Disraeli had been hesitant to agree. By 1877, however, Victoria had become so insistent he felt he could not resist any longer, for fear of offending her. Queen Victoria was known as the  grandmother of Europe  Over the course of their 21-year marriage, Victoria and Albert raised nine children together. As a means of extending Britain s influence and building international allegiances, several of their sons and daughters were married into various European monarchies, and within just a couple of generations Victoria s descendants were spread across the continent. Her 42 grandchildren could be found in the royal families of Germany, Russia, Greece, Romania, Sweden, Norway and Spain. Warring First World War royals Kaiser Wilhelm (of Germany), Tsarina Alexandra (of Russia) and George V (of Britain) were all grandchildren of Victoria. Kaiser Wilhelm reportedly remarked that had his grandmother still been alive, the First World War may never have happened, as she simply would not have allowed her relatives to go to war with one another.

(Photo by Bettmann via Getty Images) Victoria s widespread influence had unexpected genetic, as well as political, implications for Europe s monarchies. It is believed that the queen was a carrier of haemophilia and had unwittingly introduced the rare inherited disease into her bloodline. Over subsequent generations the condition resurfaced in royal families across the continent. In an age of limited medical facilities, haemophilia   which affects the blood s ability to clot   could have disastrous consequences. Victoria s own son Leopold suffered from the disease and died aged 30 after he slipped and fell, triggering a cerebral haemorrhage. Three of the queen s grandchildren also suffered from the disease, as did her great-grandson, the murdered heir to the Russian throne, Tsarevich Alexei. Listen | Deborah Cadbury shows how Queen Victoria sought to influence the future of Europe through the marriages of her descendants Queen Victoria survived at least six assassination attempts During the course of her 63-year-long reign, Victoria came out unscathed from at least six serious attempts on her life, some of which were terrifyingly close calls. In June 1840, while four months pregnant with her first child, Victoria was shot at while on an evening carriage ride with Prince Albert. For a moment it seemed as though the queen had been hit, but Albert spurred the driver to speed away to safety and the would-be assassin, Edward Oxford, was apprehended. Oxford   who was later acquitted on grounds of insanity   proved to be the first of many to target the queen while she was driving in her open-top carriage. In 1850, as the carriage slowed down to pass through the gates of Buckingham Palace, retired soldier Robert Pate ran forward and managed to strike the queen sharply on the head with a small cane. Although it transpired that the cane weighed less than three ounces, so could not have done much damage, the incident nonetheless unnerved Victoria. She escaped several more assassination attempts while riding in her carriage in 1842, 1849 and 1872. Victoria was also infamously targeted by a stalker   a notorious teenager known in the newspapers as  The Boy Jones . Between 1838 and 1841, Edward Jones managed to break into Buckingham Palace several times, hiding under the queen s sofa, sitting on her throne and reportedly even stealing her underwear, before being caught. Victoria mourned Prince Albert for 40 years On 14 December 1861, Victoria s life was rocked by the death of her beloved husband, Albert. As the prince was aged just 42 and generally enjoyed good health, his death from typhoid was highly unexpected. It came as a huge blow to the queen, who had been intensely reliant on his support, practically and politically as well as emotionally.  about Prince Albert's death Following Albert s death, Victoria retreated from public life, adopting elaborate mourning rituals that rapidly became obsessive. As time went on, the situation began to spiral out of control as it became clear the queen s period of mourning would last much longer than the two years that convention dictated. Consumed by grief, Victoria fell into a state of depression and began neglecting her royal duties. As she repeatedly refused to take part in public events, her popularity began to deteriorate. The British people began to lose patience with their queen, questioning what the  Widow of Windsor  did to earn her royal income. It was not until the 1870s that Victoria was coaxed back into gradually engaging in public life once more. Queen Victoria had a set of clothes laid out for Prince Albert each morning, right up until her own death 40 years later in 1901 Despite the decades that passed, Victoria never fully recovered from the loss of Albert. Although she had other intimate relationships   most notably a close friendship with her Scottish servant John Brown   she never remarried. She continued to wear black and sleep beside an image of Albert, and she even had a set of clothes laid out for him each morning, right up until her own death 40 years later in 1901. On 14 December 1861, Victoria s life was rocked by the death of her beloved husband, Albert. (Photo by Roger Fenton/Roger Fenton/Getty Images) Both Queen Victoria's golden and diamond jubilees were celebrated Years after her damaging retreat from public life following Albert s death, Victoria was eventually coaxed back into the limelight. Her golden and diamond jubilees of 1887 and 1897 were crucial to restoring her reputation. Designed to be show-stopping crowd-pleasers, these national festivities reinvented the  widow of Windsor  as a source of national (and imperial) pride and celebration. Grand processions and military displays were jam-packed with patriotic pomp, while Victoria s face was plastered on all manner of commemorative products. During 1897 s diamond jubilee (marking Victoria s 60th year on the throne), street parties, parades, fireworks and cricket games took place across the country. Some 300,000 of Britain s poor were treated to a special jubilee dinner, while in India 19,000 prisoners were pardoned. During a royal procession to St Paul s Cathedral, Victoria was reportedly so overwhelmed by the cheering crowds that she burst into tears. Queen Victoria was buried with a lock of John Brown's hair As she entered her eighties, Victoria was still actively taking on her royal duties. Yet, after six decades on the throne, her health finally began to decline. After being diagnosed with  cerebral exhaustion , Queen Victoria died at the age of 81 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, on 22 January 1901. The queen had refused to be embalmed, so part of the preparations that followed her death included preparing the coffin to combat the smell and absorb moisture, by scattering coal across its floor. The queen's staff also cut off her hair, dressed her in a white silk dressing gown with garter ribbon and star and placed her wedding veil over her face, before summoning members of the queen's family   the royal dukes, the kaiser and the new king, Edward VII   to lift her body into the coffin. The family then retired, leaving staff to carry out the queen s secret instructions that were never to be revealed to her children. The wedding ring of the mother of her personal servant, John Brown, was placed on her finger; a photograph of Brown and a lock of his hair were laid beside her, along with Brown s pocket handkerchief, all carefully hidden from view. The queen was buried beside her beloved Prince Albert on 4 February 1901, in the mausoleum the queen had built for her husband at Frogmore, adjoining Windsor Castle. Queen Victoria was succeeded by Edward VII, her eldest son Victoria and Albert's first son and second child was named Albert Edward, although he was known as  Bertie . As Prince of Wales, he had a love of society and 'good living' and was known for his hearty appetites, Bertie   who was crowned King Edward VII on 9 August 1902   defied expectations by proving himself to be a very successful and well-loved monarch.

        "target_summary": "Born Alexandrina Victoria in 1819, she was an unlikely candidate for the British throne, initially fifth in line. Her early life at Kensington Palace was a deeply unhappy one, dominated by the suffocating \"Kensington System\" imposed by her mother and her ambitious advisor, Sir John Conroy. This restrictive childhood, marked by isolation and constant supervision, instilled in her a profound resentment and a fierce determination.\n\nAt the unexpected age of 18, upon the death of her uncle King William IV, Victoria was awakened to the news that she was queen. Despite her petite stature, she immediately impressed her ministers with her stoicism and resolved to rule independently, swiftly moving to Buckingham Palace to escape her stifling past. Her reign, spanning nearly 64 years, would become one of the longest and most transformative in British history, witnessing immense societal and imperial change.\n\nVictoria proved a remarkably adept linguist, fluent in German, French, Italian, and Latin, and even learned Hindustani later in life, reflecting her interest in the vast empire. While her relationships with her many prime ministers varied from paternal fondness to outright disdain, she skillfully navigated the evolving political landscape.\n\nA pivotal and deeply personal aspect of her life was her marriage to her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. A genuine love match, Victoria famously proposed to Albert herself. Their 1840 wedding set a modern trend with the queen wearing white, and despite occasional tempests, Victoria adored her husband, describing him as \"perfection in every way.\" Together, they had nine children, though Victoria disliked pregnancy. Their numerous offspring, marrying into royal families across Europe, earned Victoria the moniker \"grandmother of Europe,\" profoundly influencing the continent's monarchies, yet inadvertently spreading the genetic condition haemophilia through her descendants.\n\nUnder Victoria's watchful eye, the British Empire underwent colossal expansion, nearly quadrupling in size during her tenure to become the largest the world had ever known, encompassing a quarter of the global population. This imperial zenith was cemented when she became Empress of India in 1877, a title she had long desired. Despite her formidable public role, Victoria faced numerous personal dangers, surviving at least six assassination attempts, often while riding in her open carriage, and even enduring a persistent stalker known as \"The Boy Jones.\"\n\nThe sudden death of Prince Albert in 1861, at only 42, plunged Victoria into profound and protracted grief. Retreating from public life for decades, she became known as the \"Widow of Windsor,\" her obsessive mourning rituals and reclusive nature causing her popularity to wane. She never remarried, and incredibly, continued to lay out Albert's clothes each morning until her own death, 40 years later. Her reputation, however, was spectacularly revitalized by the Golden and Diamond Jubilees in 1887 and 1897. These grand national celebrations, replete with patriotic pomp, transformed her into a revered symbol of imperial pride.\n\nVictoria remained active in her duties into her eighties, eventually succumbing to \"cerebral exhaustion\" at the age of 81 in 1901. Her burial was a testament to her private sentiments, including the secret placement of mementos relating to her trusted Scottish servant, John Brown, beside her. She was laid to rest alongside her beloved Albert, bringing to an end an era that indelibly shaped Britain and the world. Her eldest son, Edward VII, succeeded her, ultimately proving a popular and successful monarch in his own right.",

        "content": "On 24 May 1819, a baby girl was born at Kensington Palace. It was then the least fashionable of the royal palaces, hidden away behind the lime trees of its wide green gardens to the west of London. Ad The arrival of Alexandrina Victoria, as she was christened, did cause some excitement. A long line of carriages calling for news about the health of the mother, the Duchess of Kent, reached all the way to Hyde Park Corner. But at that point the new baby, King George III s latest granddaughter, was fairly low down the royal pecking order. As the years of her childhood passed, however, and as her elder cousins failed to thrive and died, Alexandrina Victoria grew in importance. It gradually emerged that the little girl growing up quietly behind closed doors at Kensington Palace would one day reign over the whole of the British Isles, including Ireland. And, in due course, a quarter of the globe s landmass. The young Victoria with her mother, Victoire, Duchess of Kent, in an 1821 portrait by William Beechey. \"My greatest of fears was that I loved her too much,\" said Victoire. (Photo by Kean Collection/Getty Images) The death of Queen Victoria's father Just as Queen Victoria s path to the throne was not obvious at the time of her birth, her education and training for the position seem at first sight to have been quite shockingly inadequate. One of the problems was the early loss of her father, the Duke of Kent. He had terrible debts, caused partly by an expensive refurbishment of his apartment at Kensington. In the winter of 1819 20, he tried to save money by taking his beloved wife and baby daughter to live cheaply in a rented holiday house, out-of-season, at Sidmouth in Devon. There he caught pneumonia and passed away. This left his widowed duchess, whose name was Victoire, in a difficult position. German, and only recently married to her duke, she spoke no English and felt ostracised by the rest of the royal family. She had few resources, either financial or intellectual, on which to fall back for the care of her daughter. One person who knew Victoire, Duchess of Kent, described her as  very delightful, in spite of want of brains . If she was scatty and disorganised, she was also warm and loving. Her late husband s will now placed Victoire in an unusual situation. Normally, a child in the line of succession would be handed over to the reigning monarch for education and guardianship. But the Duke of Kent had loved and trusted his wife, and made her guardian of their daughter instead. This was a duty Victoire intended to carry through. The rest of the royal family would perhaps have preferred it if she d slipped back off to her native Germany   but Victoire remained. The daunting implication was that, if her daughter came to the throne before she was 18, Victoire herself would become regent of Britain. She would effectively be reigning over a country of which she could not even speak the language. She wasn t allowed to sleep alone, play with other girls or even walk downstairs without someone holding her hand Unfortunately, Victoire lacked confidence in herself.  I am not fit for my place, no, I am not,  she would say.  I am just an old stupid goose.  No wonder that she now fell into the outstretched hands of a man on whom she would come greatly to rely: her late husband s adjutant from his army days, John Conroy. Who was Sir John Conroy? Conroy was a 6ft, black-haired, good-looking chancer from an Irish background. It's easy to see how Victoire was forced by necessity, loneliness and incapacity to depend on the man who became her advisor and factotum (an employee who takes on several types of work). Her husband's death had left her both distraught and penniless. Her brother Leopold came down to Sidmouth to help out, but failed to bring her any ready money. \"Gut, gut Leopold,\" as Victoire called him, in her German accent, was nevertheless \"rather slow in the uptake and in making decisions\". It was Conroy, with his \"activity and capability\", who arranged a loan for her at Coutts bank. Sir John Conroy, comptroller of the Duchess of Kent's household. (Image by Getty Images) And Conroy could see, as the duchess s chief advisor, that he might one day become the power behind the throne. He encouraged Victoire and the little Victoria to go back to live at Kensington Palace, and there devised something called the  System , a set of strict rules under which the princess would live. What was the Kensington System? It sounds rather sinister, and on some levels it was. At its most basic, the System (as Conroy himself called it, with capital S) was for the young Victoria s personal safety. It demanded she be kept in semi-seclusion at Kensington Palace. Behind the garden walls, she d be isolated from both disease and assassination attempts. Secondly, the fact that she was rarely seen at court distanced her, in people s minds, from the unpopular regime of her uncles, Kings George and then William IV. As a possible future queen, she d remain untainted by association with them. She would be a fresh start   or, as Conroy put it,  the Nation s Hope . But thirdly   and sinisterly   the System also seems to have been about breaking Victoria s spirit, and getting her to submit. It contained an element of surveillance: she wasn t allowed to sleep alone, play with other girls or even walk downstairs without having someone holding her hand. And each day she had to write in her  Behaviour Book  how well   or badly   she d behaved (see more rules below). On the podcast | Professor Jane Ridley reveal lesser-known aspects of Queen Victoria's life Accounts of Queen Victoria s childhood usually take at face value her adult recollections of this period in her life, in which she complained of trauma and loneliness. But it s also worth bearing in mind that she did have a natural tendency to make a drama out of her own life. And perhaps there were some elements of the System that helped to make her reign a success. There is no doubt that Conroy was indeed a manipulative bully, but there is also something more to his poor reputation among historians than just Victoria s well-recorded dislike. The snobbish court establishment looked down on his lack of an aristocratic background. Born in Wales to Anglo-Irish parents   his father was a barrister   Conroy had reached his position of influence entirely by his own efforts, which contemporaries found troubling. Secondly, if the System Conroy had devised had three components, the first two were wildly successful. He did keep Victoria safe. And, through a carefully stage-managed series of public appearances in her teenage years, he did manage to create an enormous groundswell of warmth for her when, eventually, she became queen. The Kensington System that governed Queen Victoria's childhood Victoria was not allowed to spend time by herself and she always had to sleep in her mother s room. Victoria could not walk downstairs without holding the hand of an adult in case she fell. (It sounds melodramatic, but Victoria did actually confirm in later life that this was a rule she had to abide by.) Victoria was not allowed to meet any strangers or third parties without her governess being present. The young Victoria had to write in a  Behaviour Book  how well she d behaved each day, so that her mother could assess her progress. Sometimes it was good, sometimes  VERY NAUGHTY . Victoria could only appear in public on carefully stage-managed  publicity tours . This was to distance her from the unpopular regime of her uncles, Kings George IV and William IV, and to present her as  the Nation s Hope . Victoria was not allowed to dance the scandalous and intimate new dance called the waltz, not even (as is often said) with other royal relations. She would never waltz until married to Prince Albert. Victoria had to build up her strength by exercising with her Indian clubs [a pair of bowling-pin shaped wooden clubs] and a machine with pulleys and weights, and was mandated to have plenty of fresh air. She would be a life-long devotee of open windows, to the extent that her courtiers would always be shivering. The young Victoria was not allowed to gorge on her food. She was allowed to eat bread with milk and plain roast mutton, and was restricted from eating her favourite things: sweetmeats and fruit. Young Victoria's publicity tours One of the items on display in an exhibition at Kensington Palace is the small wooden travelling bed that Victoria used for another strand of Conroy s System: the country-wide  publicity tours  that he organised for her. Taking her on closely choreographed visits to provincial towns and nobleman s houses around Britain gave her future subjects an intriguing glimpse of their future monarch. It was a strategy that paid off entirely. When, in the early hours of 20 June 1837, the 18-year-old Victoria was woken up at Kensington Palace with news that her uncle had died in the night, she was able to emerge   as Conroy had planned   as a fresh start for the monarchy. The home-loving Victoria would become the perfect pin-up for a country tired of the debauchery and excesses of previous kings Victoria's journey to the throne was a struggle. But once she was queen, she would not long remain at Kensington Palace. She removed herself as quickly as she could to the relative freedom of Buckingham Palace instead. There s a well-known and compelling narrative that sees Victoria, on her accession day, cutting free of the System to the extent, even, of changing her name. When called on to sign her name, the new queen put just plain  Victoria    not the  Alexandrina Victoria  of her christening. It s widely believed that she was called  Drina  in childhood, rather than Victoria, and that the change symbolised a break from the past. But her mother had some time earlier agreed that the  Alexandrina  should be dropped quietly, and her toys are marked with a  V . The duchess had, in any case, also called her daughter by the pet name of  Vickelchen . How did the Kensington System affect Victoria? So the System was not entirely a black-and-white affair. Even the most unpleasant aspect of it, that of surveillance, perhaps had an unintended benefit. It toughened Victoria up. She would have to face a lifetime of being watched and judged. The Behaviour Books were just the start. As her mother explained to her:  You cannot escape  from the situation you are born in.  Victoria might as well be given the chance to get used to living under watch and under pressure. This was far from normal for a 19th-century girl, who was expected by society to shrink away from attention. But even Victoria s Uncle Leopold, an enemy of Conroy s, likewise coached his niece about the element of performance that would be so central to her role as a constitutional monarch.  High personages are a little like stage actors,  he explained.  They must always make efforts to please their public.  Queen Victoria as a young woman, c1835. (Image by Getty Images) Harsh judgement has sometimes been heaped upon the Duchess of Kent for not standing up to Conroy when he bullied her. But while Victoire lacked moral fibre, that did not make her a bad person, and this too is something that Victoria herself in later life came to appreciate. As Victoire explained, she d simply done her best for her daughter.  My greatest of fears was that I loved her too much,  she said. And what Victoire did bequeath to her daughter was a huge capacity for love. Most royals of the early 19th century could not afford to look for love in their marriages, which were pragmatic affairs undertaken for blood or politics. Yet Victoire, creature of an age in which romantic novels were beginning to provide a new template for living, had sought and found a soulmate in her husband. She brought up her daughter to desire the same thing   and Queen Victoria's marriage to Prince Albert was a love match. Victoria came in later life to realise the love her mother had felt for her   despite the System   and she also spent her childhood watching her mother defer so much to the advice of a man. The result of this was that she herself, in due course, would cling all the more closely to her own family. And in doing so, Queen Victoria would model for the media and the nation a domestic life that was more than acceptable to the age in which she lived. The dutiful queen The industrial revolution had allowed a man, working in industry or business, to earn enough money to keep his wife at home, untroubled by the outside world. In her own family life, Victoria would become a kind of super-Victorian: submissive to her husband, Prince Albert, apparently devoted to her children   the perfect pin-up for a populace tired of the debauchery, the mistresses and the general excesses of previous kings. But while the young Victoria was loved to the extent of being spoilt, there were still terrible gaps in her more formal education. The System had given her nothing more than the standard education for a genteel young lady being prepared for marriage. The majority of her time was spent on music, drawing (at which she excelled), dancing, religion, French and German. Her tutors reported her as  indifferent  at spelling, but  good  at most other subjects.  The rest of her education,  one of Victoria s prime ministers later noted,  she owes to her own natural shrewdness and quickness.  While the young Victoria was loved to the extent of being spoilt, there were still terrible gaps in her more formal education But there was also a curious advantage to having a queen who relied on her  natural shrewdness . It made her an instinctive, populist politician in a way that her classically educated male court and cabinet could never really appreciate. When she did ultimately come to write a book, for example, it was far from a learned tome. She published an account of holidays she d taken in Scotland, which became a huge success and a runaway bestseller. Its rather banal content appealed directly to the people among her subjects who mattered, the people who held the balance of political power in the 19th century: the middle class. While other monarchies across Europe were being threatened by revolution, the British monarchy survived the 19th century unscathed. This was not least because the middle classes thought that their undereducated, dutiful, home-loving queen simply wasn t worth overthrowing. It was not the result that Conroy s strange  System  was intended to achieve. Victoria would look back on her Kensington childhood with horror and regret. But far from being the breaking of her, you could argue that Victoria s unusual childhood was in fact the making of her reign.

        "target_summary": "Queen Victoria's extraordinary life began not with fanfare, but in the subdued setting of Kensington Palace on May 24, 1819. Born Alexandrina Victoria, she arrived into a royal family where her immediate position in the line of succession was surprisingly distant. Yet fate, through a series of premature deaths among her elder cousins, slowly elevated this quiet girl to a position of immense significance: she would one day command an empire stretching across a quarter of the globe.\n\nHer infancy, however, was swiftly shadowed by tragedy. Her father, the Duke of Kent, succumbed to pneumonia while trying to economize by the sea. This left his young, German-born widow, Victoire, Duchess of Kent, profoundly vulnerable and isolated. Adrift within the cold confines of the royal family, speaking no English and described as warm but disorganized, Victoire was ill-equipped financially and emotionally to navigate her unexpected role as sole guardian to the future monarch.\n\nInto this vacuum stepped Sir John Conroy, her late husband's adjutant and a charmingly ambitious \"chancer.\" Recognizing immense potential power in controlling the young princess, Conroy orchestrated their return to Kensington, where he implemented the infamous \"Kensington System.\" Ostensibly designed for Victoria's safety and to cultivate her public image as \"the Nation's Hope\"—untouched by her unpopular uncles' reigns—the System also served a far more sinister purpose. It was a suffocating regimen intended to break Victoria's spirit and ensure her absolute submission.\n\nUnder Conroy's watchful eye, the young princess endured an almost total isolation. She was forbidden from sleeping alone, from playing with other girls, or even descending a staircase without an adult's guiding hand. Each day brought the scrutiny of a \"Behaviour Book,\" where her conduct was meticulously recorded. Her life was a carefully stage-managed affair, devoid of simple joys like waltzing or indulging in beloved sweetmeats, replaced instead by rigorous exercise and restricted meals.\n\nVictoria would later recount her childhood as a period of profound trauma and loneliness, a sentiment widely accepted, though some historians note her dramatic tendencies. While Conroy was undeniably a manipulative bully, his system did achieve its primary goals: Victoria was kept safe, and through carefully choreographed public appearances, a wave of public affection was built for her future reign. Paradoxically, this oppressive upbringing inadvertently hardened Victoria, preparing her for a lifetime under relentless public scrutiny—a unique advantage for a constitutional monarch.\n\nWhen, at the tender age of 18, Victoria ascended the throne on June 20, 1837, she wasted no time in asserting her independence. She famously abandoned Kensington for the relative freedom of Buckingham Palace, symbolically signing her name simply \"Victoria\"—a poignant gesture of breaking free from her past, shedding the \"Alexandrina\" of her birth.\n\nDespite the Kensington System's harshness, her mother Victoire, though lacking moral fortitude against Conroy, had bequeathed to Victoria an immense capacity for love, stemming from her own romantic marriage. This profound influence steered Victoria toward her own love match with Prince Albert, a cornerstone of her reign. Furthermore, witnessing her mother's deference to Conroy instilled in Victoria a fierce determination to cling to her own family, modeling a domestic life that resonated deeply with the Victorian era's burgeoning middle class.\n\nWhile her formal education had gaps, Victoria's \"natural shrewdness\" transformed her into an instinctively populist monarch. Her approachable public image and relatable domestic life, so different from the excesses of previous kings, made her an endearing figure who embodied the nation's values. Ultimately, the very \"System\" that aimed to control and perhaps diminish her, instead forged a resilient and beloved queen, proving that her unusual childhood was, in fact, the very making of her extraordinary reign.",

In August 1900, a telegram had arrived announcing that her favourite son   the chain-smoking, heavy drinking Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh   had died from throat cancer.  Oh! God! my poor darling Affie gone too! My 3rd Grown up child. It is hard at 81!  she wrote. A few weeks later she received the news that her much-loved grandson, Prince Christian Victor, eldest son of her daughter Princess Helena, had succumbed to enteric fever while serving with the British Army in South Africa. On Christmas day, Jane, Lady Churchill, the queen s oldest and most trusted friend, was found dead in her bed while staying with the queen at Osborne House.  I am sending for my mourning trappings  observed Marie Mallet, maid of honour to the queen,  we never escape jet for long . The fading queen As Queen Victoria ended the 19th century, she was not her usual self. She was visibly fading: her voracious appetite had disappeared and she had lost almost half her body weight. She was confined to a wheelchair, almost blind and had lapses of memory and moments of confusion. Yet no one could contemplate the mortality of the little old lady who had sat on the throne for almost 64 years. Her children were in denial, her government was unprepared, and the public knew nothing at all. Victoria's own view of the future was bleak:  Another year begun, I am feeling so weak and unwell, that I enter upon it sadly.  Twenty-two days later, shortly after 6.30pm on Tuesday 22 January 1901, Superintendent Fraser ordered the household police to surround the queen s Isle of Wight residence Osborne House. All telephone and telegraph wires were to be suspended, and any servant or messenger to be prevented from leaving. A short while later he walked down the long gravel drive to the entrance gate where a large crowd was waiting, and pinned a small notice on to the bulletin board.  Osborne House, January 22, 6.45pm Her Majesty the Queen breathed her last at 6.30pm, surrounded by her children and grand-children.  And so the news of the queen s passing was announced to the world. Her death stunned the nation. What followed was chaos and confusion. There was no one alive who could remember how to bury a monarch and this queen had asked for a full military state funeral.

The queen's terminal decline had been rapid and had taken the family by surprise. Her children squabbled, her doctors quarrelled, and the public were misled and kept in the dark. Sir James Reid, the queen s personal physician for more than 20 years, had known the end was nigh but had great difficulty convincing the royal family of the inevitable, even in the final days when they saw the queen was drifting between delirium and lucidity. Princess Helena and Princess Beatrice, the queen s daughters and constant companions, could not accept that their mother could actually die and tried to maintain business as usual. The Prince of Wales was reluctant to cancel his weekend jaunts to the country; the Duke of Connaught [the seventh child of Victoria and Albert] was on his way to Berlin to celebrate 200 years of the Prussian monarchy; while other members of the royal family enjoyed a performance of Little Nell in London s West End. In desperation, Reid secretly telegraphed the queen s grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany. On receipt of the telegram, the kaiser immediately cancelled the celebrations and left Berlin with the Duke of Connaught and set sail for England, throwing the squabbling family into turmoil and forcing them to make public news of the queen s illness. This unexpected announcement took the nation completely by surprise and rumours began to abound.  Queen Unconscious, Sinking Fast  read one headline,  Queen Rallying: Has Eaten and Slept. Official  read another. The queen had been as reluctant to accept her mortality as those around her and had appeared to rally.  Am I better?  she asked Sir James,  I should like to live a little longer, as I have still a few things to settle.  As if her trusted doctor could make her live, Sir James kindly reassured her:  Yes, Your Majesty has been very ill but you are now better.  Meanwhile the Prince of Wales and his sisters (known as  the petticoats ) tried to prevent the kaiser reaching Osborne. Events took a dramatic turn for the worse from 17 January as the queen suffered a series of strokes and the entire royal family was suddenly summoned to the Isle of Wight. The government ground to a halt as the queen was no longer able to carry out her constitutional duties. There were talks of a regency, while Osborne House   already overflowing with guests   was bombarded with anxious telegrams and telephone calls, and journalists gathered excitedly outside the gates.

(Photo by Time Life Pictures/Mansell/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images) The queen began to sink as the family crowded into her small bedroom where the Bishop of Winchester and the Rector of St Mildred s Church chanted prayers and hymns. The kaiser sat motionless at her left side for more than two hours, propping her up with his one good arm, while Sir James Reid sat on her right holding her hand. The queen, conscious but unable to see, lamented repeatedly:  Sir James, I'm very ill.  Each time Reid replied:  Your Majesty will soon be better.  A young nurse knelt on the back of the bed, supporting the queen s head. As the room filled with the sound of sobbing and weeping mingled with the chanting of the clerics, each son, daughter and grandchild was summoned by name to kiss the queen's hand and say farewell. News of Victoria s death When the end came, Osborne House was surrounded by police to prevent the news leaking out before the new king Edward VII had concluded the formalities. A short while later, the small notice of announcement was pinned on the bulletin board where a large crowd of journalists were waiting. A crowd of carriages set off at gallop. Bicycles careered down the hill. And men ran along bawling at the top of their voices \"Queen dead\". All of this could be seen and heard as the press rushed down to the harbour to break the news to the world. An early 20th-century illustration depicts the announcement of Queen Victoria's death. (Photo by Alamy) The London Evening News had a black-bordered special edition out on the street within the hour. Theatre performances were interrupted as audiences poured out into the streets. The  Great Tom  bell of St Paul s tolled across the city of London. Across the nation, people gathered in small groups to sing  God Save the Queen  and by eight o clock, shop windows were dressed in black mourning; Whiteleys department store in London had queues ten deep as customers lined up to purchase their black mourning outfits. Meanwhile, panic broke out in the royal household as they realised that all precedents were 64 years out of date, and nobody knew what to do.  The ignorance of historical precedent in men whose business it is to know is wonderful,  wrote Reginal Brett, Viscount Esher.  I cannot describe to you the historical ignorance, of everyone from top to bottom   who should know something of procedure. You would think that the English Monarchy had [not] been buried since the time of Alfred.  Panic also gripped the government when the queen s personal instructions for her funeral were revealed. Previous royal funerals had been private candlelit affairs, taking place at night, but this queen had requested a full military state funeral. No embalming, no lying-in-state, no mourning black; she wanted a white funeral, purple and white, with white ponies and a gun carriage, and the first burial of a monarch outside the confines of Westminster Abbey and St George s Chapel since George I. Funeral preparations: Victoria's coffin, death mask, and secret instructions The Earl Marshal [the royal officer in charge of organising royal ceremonies and processions] and Lord Chamberlain [in charge of the royal household] were at loggerheads as to who should take charge, while the new king s household refused to take over responsibility until the queen was buried   yet the old queen s household no longer had any authority. The Accession council was hastily convened, where the Lord Mayor had to be forcibly ejected, and to the consternation of those present the king extemporised his accession speech.

(Photo by Reinhold Thiele/Thiele/Getty Images) The casting of a death mask was ordered by the kaiser, causing uproar among the royal family as it was known the queen had disliked the use of such masks. The Duke of York was suddenly struck down with a dangerous illness and the royal undertaker arrived from London but forgot to bring the coffin. The Lord Chamberlain refused to cooperate with the Earl Marshal, and the kaiser turned on the Bishop of Winchester, who had been the queen s favourite cleric, saying that if he were his cleric he would have him hauled out into the courtyard by the neck and shot. Sir Frederick Ponsonby, the queen s assistant private secretary, travelled to London to discover the Earl Marshal s office in total chaos with nothing arranged. In desperation, he called on Lord Roberts, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the British Army, who gave Ponsonby carte blanche to organise the military as he saw fit. There were only a few days left to organise the ceremonial. A February 1901 drawing from L'Illustration, showing Queen Victoria on her death bed. (Photo by Culture Club/Getty Images) The royal coffin was built by a local carpenter and delivered to Osborne House. The doctor Reid, with the help of Mrs Tuck, the queen s devoted dresser, prepared the queen for her coffin. The queen had refused to be embalmed, so they scattered charcoal on the floor of the coffin to combat the smell and absorb the moisture. They cut off her hair, dressed her in a white silk dressing gown with garter ribbon and star and placed her wedding veil over her face. They summoned the royal dukes, the kaiser and the new king to lift her body into the coffin. The family then retired, leaving Reid and Mrs Tuck to carry out the queen s secret instructions   never to be revealed to her children. The wedding ring of the mother of her personal servant, John Brown, was placed on her finger; a photograph of Brown and a lock of his hair were laid beside her, along with Brown s pocket handkerchief, all carefully hidden from view. The queen was now ready for her final journey. Queen Victoria s funeral procession As the date of the funeral approached, the processional route was prepared. Around 33,000 soldiers entered London and had to be fed and billeted. Advertisements appeared offering seats in windows and balconies overlooking the route for 25 guineas ( 3,000). In a fit of pique the Pope, \"unwilling to be represented at the funeral of a Protestant Queen , refused to send a representative or to allow an official mass to be said for the queen, while businesses demanded that the year of mourning be reduced, fearful of its effect on trade. Meanwhile, information reached Gustav Steinhauer, a personal bodyguard to the kaiser, of an assassination plot by three notorious anarchists. They intended to kill the kaiser and Leopold II, King of the Belgians, during the funeral procession. Scotland Yard was informed. On 1 February 1901, the cortege crossed the Solent, flanked by 11 miles of battleships and cruisers, each booming out their  minute  guns as the tiny yacht Alberta passed by, bearing the queen s coffin. The cortege remained in the harbour overnight and proceeded by train to London s Victoria station in the early hours of 2 February. This was followed by the largest military procession since the Duke of Wellington s funeral in 1852, through Hyde Park to Paddington. The procession lasted two hours, with the queen s coffin standing high on the gun carriage drawn by eight white and cream ponies through the crowded   yet eerily silent   streets. Then came the final train journey to Windsor, where the procession waited as the coffin was placed on the gun carriage. More complications followed when the horses, having stood motionless in the freezing weather, suddenly kicked and broke away from their traces, almost toppling the coffin to the ground. The front of the procession had already marched off and reached the end of Windsor Street before it could be stopped and turned around. The Royal Horse Artillery were unable to re-harness the horses and disaster loomed. Prince Louis Battenberg (grandfather of Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh) rescued the day, suggesting:  If it is impossible to mend the traces you can always get the naval guard of honour to drag the gun carriage.  Accordingly, 138 bluejackets piled their arms [propped up their weapons], attached ropes to the carriage where the harnesses had been, and dragged the gun carriage to St George s Chapel by hand, giving birth to a new royal tradition. (You can see the moving images of this procession on British Path s newsreel). Crowds line the streets to watch the funeral cortege of Queen Victoria in February 1901. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The service in St George s Chapel was also chaotic. The clerical procession, led by two Archbishops, arrived an hour too early and had to stand patiently in the nave, which was half-empty owing to a major blunder by the Earl Marshal. The earl s officials were seen dragging guests from their seats to spread them out in order to hide the mistake, while the uncooperative Lord Chamberlain tried to explain why he had requested that the women guests should come  in trousers . The official service was followed by a moving ceremony for the family on 4 February, in the mausoleum the queen had built for her husband at Frogmore, adjoining Windsor Castle. King Edward VII and his grandson, the six-year-old future Edward VIII, knelt with the kaiser as the queen was slowly lowered in to the crypt to be laid to rest beside her beloved Prince Albert. Queen Victoria's funeral on film Joanna Bourke examines newsreel footage of Queen Victoria's \"remarkable\" funeral procession in February 1901 The film clearly demonstrates the influence of royalty (five reigning monarchs, as well as many other members of royal families, accompanied Edward VII in the procession), as well as the prestige of the empire, navy and army. It also testifies to the imagery surrounding Queen Victoria, as both pious and feminine, yet a formidable leader. The funeral was prolonged. The coffin had to be transported from Osborne House to the port of Cowes, then across the Solent on the royal yacht Alberta. One reporter recalled looking at the new king (who was aboard another yacht) through his telescope. Although he was a quarter of a mile away, the reporter observed that Edward s face was  so white and very set, the real king, unaware that any man could see him, intensely melancholy, intensely sad . It was, he added, a  sacrilege to gaze, and I turned the glass and looked no more . How much did Queen Victoria's funeral cost? The funeral had cost  35,500 ( 4.5 million). As the Westminster Gazette reported after the funeral, the queen had outlived all the members of her Privy Council who were alive in 1837; all the peers who had held their titles in 1837 (except Earl Nelson, who was 14 in that year) and all the members who had sat in the House of Commons at the time of her accession. She saw 10 prime ministers; five Archbishops of Canterbury and six commanders-in-chief; 18 presidents of the United States; 11 Viceroys of Canada; 16 Viceroys of India and France successively ruled by one king; one emperor and seven presidents of a Republic. She had also outlived all nine of her bridesmaids.  In a funeral at sea the ship is slowed down when the body is committed to the deep but once that has taken place there can be no waiting   the order is  Full Steam Ahead ,  the Gazette reported.  It is so with national affairs. Everything has been slowed down to do honour to our Queen, but the ship of state cannot tarry long. Full steam ahead is today's order   just because it can be nothing else.

        "target_summary": "The year 1900 proved an \"annus horribilis\" for Queen Victoria, a period she described as \"nothing but sadness and horrors.\" The ongoing Boer War deeply troubled her, its anxieties compounded by a series of personal tragedies: an assassination attempt on her eldest son, the Prince of Wales, and the devastating diagnosis of incurable breast cancer for her eldest daughter, Vicky. Further heartbreak struck with the deaths of her beloved son, Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, from throat cancer, and her grandson, Prince Christian Victor, to enteric fever in South Africa. The year concluded with the quiet passing of her most trusted friend, Lady Churchill, on Christmas Day, leaving the Queen submerged in perpetual mourning.\n\nAs the 19th century drew to a close, the formidable monarch, who had reigned for nearly 64 years, was visibly fading. Her once voracious appetite gone, she had lost considerable weight, her vision dimmed, and memory lapses hinted at a mind increasingly clouded. Confined to a wheelchair, Victoria herself held a bleak view of the future, yet her family, government, and the unaware public struggled to fathom the mortality of this enduring figure.\n\nHer terminal decline in January 1901 was swift and chaotic. Doctors wrestled with a royal family in denial, while the public remained largely ignorant. It took the decisive, unannounced arrival of her grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, to finally force the official acknowledgement of the Queen’s critical condition, shattering the family's fragile attempts to maintain normalcy and startling the nation. From January 17th, a series of strokes gripped the Queen, bringing the government to a halt and summoning the entire royal family to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. In her small bedroom, surrounded by loved ones, Victoria, conscious but almost blind, repeatedly voiced her profound illness as prayers and hymns filled the air. Each son, daughter, and grandchild was called to her bedside for a final, tearful farewell, the Kaiser himself silently supporting her with his arm.\n\nOn January 22, 1901, at 6:30 pm, Queen Victoria breathed her last. The news, carefully released, plunged the nation into stunned silence and confusion. Across London, the \"Great Tom\" bell tolled, newspapers hastily published black-bordered editions, and theatre audiences poured into streets where shops quickly dressed windows in black mourning, reflecting a collective sense of profound loss and an uncertain future.\n\nThe practicalities of a royal funeral, however, exposed a surprising void: no one alive remembered the precedents for burying a monarch. Victoria, with characteristic foresight, had left unconventional instructions: a full military state funeral, not the traditional private, candlelit affair. She desired a white and purple spectacle, no embalming, no lying-in-state, and a gun carriage drawn by white ponies. This threw the royal household and government officials into disarray, with fierce squabbles over jurisdiction and procedure.\n\nAmidst this chaos, a deeply personal and poignant act unfolded. Queen Victoria had refused embalming, so her personal physician and devoted dresser prepared her body. In a secret gesture, hidden from her children, they placed cherished mementos of her beloved servant, John Brown—his wedding ring, a photograph, and a lock of his hair—within her coffin, a final, intimate connection to a treasured companion.\n\nThe funeral itself was a spectacle of unprecedented scale and unexpected drama. A vast naval cortege, flanked by miles of battleships, escorted her coffin across the Solent. The subsequent military procession through London, the largest since Wellington’s funeral, saw her coffin, high on a gun carriage, drawn through eerily silent, crowded streets. However, at Windsor, a near-disaster occurred when the horses, stiff from the cold, bolted from the gun carriage. In a moment of quick thinking, Prince Louis Battenberg suggested the naval guard of honour haul the carriage themselves, giving birth to a new, enduring royal tradition.\n\nDespite minor organizational blunders during the chapel service, the final, private ceremony at Frogmore Mausoleum offered a deeply moving conclusion. There, beside her adored Prince Albert, the Queen was slowly lowered into the crypt. Her monumental funeral, costing £35,500, not only marked the end of an extraordinary reign but also symbolized the immense transition for a nation that had known no other sovereign, now poised to sail \"full steam ahead\" into a new era.",

        "content": "Prior to the arrival of TV series Victoria in 2016 (which first aired in Britain on ITV and later on PBS America) most of us, when imagining Queen Victoria, would have had in mind her incarnation in the 1997 film Mrs Brown, as the elderly, difficult and often irascible monarch played by Judi Dench. Ad Photographs of the queen during the long period of her widowhood from 1861 (following the death of her husband, Prince Albert) to her own death in 1901 only underline the image of the unsmiling dowager dressed in black   a woman with no interest in clothes, in fashion or her own physical attractiveness. But of course, Queen Victoria did not always look so sober, jowly and humourless. She was in fact once very vibrant and lovely, with an arresting personality and huge amounts of energy for music, dancing and staying up late.

(Photo by Getty Images) Born in 1819, Victoria was a fat, jolly baby, who as a toddler had the most appealing dimples and fair hair. When she was still Princess Alexandrina   or simply  Drina , as her mother called her   she was rather beautiful,  cherubic  even. Her features were  clustered round by glossy fair ringlets ; her complexion  remarkably transparent, with a soft and often heightening tinge of the sweet blush rose upon her cheeks, that imparted a peculiar brilliancy to her clear blue eyes , as one observer gushed in the 1820s.

In 1831 Victoria s governess, Baroness Lehzen, described her 12-year-old charge as  very pretty , although there was no getting away from her lack of stature: the princess had a  graceful figure , and, Lehzen noted,  a very small foot . The court diarist Charles Greville, however, was rather unkind, thinking the young princess a rather  short vulgar-looking child .

In 1846, an American visitor to London who had attended one of the queen s receptions described her as a  pleasing lady-like little woman  whose height  cannot exceed five feet . Some writers have stated that she was shorter than this: 4  10  or 4  11 . However, in her recent biography of the queen historian Lucy Worsley revealed that the portrait painter Thomas Sully, who executed one of the first and most lovely portraits of the young Queen Victoria in 1838, claimed to have measured her with a tape measure at 5  1  precisely. A picture of Queen Victoria with her pet dog named Sharp at Balmoral Castle, c1867. (Photo by Getty Images) Victoria's Uncle Leopold, solicitous about the young princess s wellbeing in his many letters to her, worried that she was not getting enough exercise or eating the right food. But despite all his advice on her diet, Victoria never grew. Her marriage, nine pregnancies and a lifetime s overeating inexorably took their toll on her figure, which spread ever outwards rather than upwards as she aged, thus making her appear even shorter. Victoria s lack of height always frustrated her   she was once heard to exclaim in frustration:  Everyone grows but me!

As the young Victoria grew older her fair hair became darker and mousier and straighter, and although she had a very good complexion, her intolerance of heat caused her face to flush. Her mouth was rather thin and rabbity, and, when she smiled the princess displayed small, short teeth  like those of a mouse , according to Princess Marie of Romania. Victoria s half-sister, Feodora, noted her habit of keeping her mouth always a little open and advised her to try hard to keep it closed, though another commentator noted that her mouth, when closed, was  vacant and inexpressive . Queen Victoria, c1890s, in an open carriage on the Isle of Wight. (Photo by Getty Images) There is definitely a genuine prettiness in the early portraits of Queen Victoria, but one could never describe her as conventionally beautiful   except perhaps in that famous image of her gazing up adoringly at her husband, Prince Albert, on their wedding day. Victoria shared a likeness with her male German ancestors in some of her facial features   the slightly hooked Coburg nose, and the receding Hanoverian chin were features passed down to several of her children; the queen particularly lamented the latter in her son, Bertie, prince of Wales. It is a great shame that almost all official images of Queen Victoria are with a neutral, if not po-faced expression, for she in fact had a lovely smile.  When animated and smiling, the expression is pleasing in the extreme,  wrote one observer:  her whole face laughs . Thomas Sully s portrait was thought to be the closest to the queen s real character, which was  always best seized at a moment of animation . But that elusive smile would not be captured by a photographer until much later in her life. What did Queen Victoria's voice sound like? Queen Victoria is said to have had a lovely, pealing laugh, as well as a habit of shrugging her shoulders when she did so. Her voice   both spoken and when singing   was universally admired for its sweet, bell-like tones. Her self-confident delivery in public was noticed from her very first Privy Council meeting, held soon after her accession in 1837. At her first state opening of parliament later that year, the queen s voice was, according to Sallie Stevenson, the wife of the American ambassador,  sweet as a Virginia nightingale s . sweet, yet soft; powerful, yet melodious . American artist Thomas Sully echoed these sentiments:  I should be gratified if I were able to give an idea of the sweet tone of voice, and gentle manner of Queen Victoria! It was impressive of dignity and mildness, and at the same time I felt quite at my ease, as tho in company with merely a well bred lady.  A photograph by Roger Fenton of Queen Victoria, c1856. (Photo by Getty Images) The actress Fanny Kemble considered the young queen s voice to be  exquisite ; she had, she said,  not heard any spoken words more musical . And the voice lost none of its attractiveness in old age; in the 1890s the actress Ellen Terry waxed poetic, remarking that it sounded  like a silver stream flowing over golden stones . It is a shame therefore that a tiny fragment of a recording of Victoria s voice, made at Balmoral on a treadle-powered Bell-Tainter Graphophone in 1888 is too fleeting and scratchy for us to be able to catch any sense of it; a later recording made in 1898 was apparently destroyed.  | The young Queen Victoria s struggle to gain the throne Did Queen Victoria have a German accent? This is a much-debated point. Victoria was brought up in relative seclusion by her German mother, Victoire, Duchess of Kent, and German governess, Baroness Lehzen, and the three of them spoke their native language for most of the time. Until she was about 12 years of age Victoria s tutors were mostly German and so it is unsurprising that a report on her education in early 1831 confirmed that she  speaks English with a German accent . However, with the prospect of her becoming a future queen of Great Britain, it is likely that some of that accent was trained out of her by elocution lessons. A portrait of the future Queen Victoria as a child with her mother, Victoire, Duchess of Kent, c1822. (Photo by Kean Collection/Getty Images) When married, Victoria and Prince Albert conversed among themselves and with many of their foreign relatives in German, and they were often heard quarrelling in German too. However, it would seem that although, as she grew older, the queen had no overt accent, she had a slight German lilt to her voice that even rubbed off on her children, particularly Bertie. Victoria s conversational speech and letters were larded with German words and turns of phrase. She is said to have had the habit of using the German interjection  so , pronounced as  tzo , and accentuating the  sh  sound German-style as  sch . Victoria s pronunciation of  Shocking!  when outraged, apparently had a particularly Germanic ring to it. Queen Victoria with her husband, Prince Albert, c1854. (Photo by   Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) The queen s poise While Victoria was by no means conventionally beautiful, and indeed at first glance she appeared quite unprepossessing because of her lack of height, she had tremendous presence   as was noted by many people. Her presence made her seem taller than she was; as an 1846 American visitor noted:  her admirable gait, and the absence of that  tip-toe  carriage usually observable in short persons, redeem her from insignificance.  Queen Victoria also had tremendous poise, as Thomas Sully noticed. She had the ability to make a whole room stand still when she entered and it was a queenliness unique to her, described by Princess Lieven as  an aplomb, an air of command and dignity . Such was Victoria s grace of movement that she had an extraordinary ability to glide across a room, as historian Thomas Carlyle noted when they met in 1869. The queen, he said, had  sailed out towards [him] as if moving on skates . Such lightness on her feet had perhaps been acquired through her youthful enthusiasm for dancing, and Victoria remained a nimble dancer well into old age. Do TV and films show us the real Victoria? There have been many attempts to capture Queen Victoria in film and television right from the beginning of the silent film era. Aside from Anna Neagle in the 1930s on film, one of the first memorable TV Victorias was that by Annette Crosbie in the 1975 ITV series Edward the Seventh. Rosemary Leach and Sheila Reed also took on the role of the older queen on TV in the 1970s. But it is undoubtedly the Judi Dench version in the popular 1997 film Mrs Brown, and her 2017 reprise of the role in Victoria and Abdul, that stick in our minds. Dench s highly plausible and down-to-earth interpretation set a benchmark for the older queen that it is doubtful anyone will ever match.  | Queen Victoria on screen As for the younger queen: in 2001 Victoria Hamilton (who has since played the Queen Mother in The Crown) delivered an excellent, realistic interpretation in BBC TV s Victoria and Albert. Emily Blunt s spirited performance in the feature-film Young Victoria (2009), while engaging and accomplished, presented us with a far taller and prettier version of the original. And this remains the problem with all portrayals of the young Queen Victoria. There is no doubt that the lovely and vivacious Jenna Coleman has now indelibly set her stamp on the role through three series of the ITV series Victoria. In the first series in particular Colman showed us a side of the queen s headstrong and impetuous personality with all its foibles and shortcomings that had not been fully explored before on TV. She has since grown into the role with considerable skill and authority. But is she the real Victoria? Jenna Coleman in ITV's 'Victoria'. (  ITV - Mammoth Screen/DR/TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy Stock Photo) Alas, no. For all our wishful thinking, the years of romantic love were all too brief for the real Queen Victoria, who grew plainer and dumpier with every pregnancy. Widowhood at the age of 42 aged Victoria prematurely. The beautiful blue eyes became increasingly bulgy, the mouth more decidedly turned down, and the chin disappeared into fleshy jowls   contributing to an image of Victoria as a stony-faced and humourless matriarch. This does her a great disservice but sadly it remains the prevailing sense that we have of her. Queen Victoria aged 53. (Photo by   Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) Sadly, too, no images of the queen that have come down to us truly convey the immediacy and force of her commanding personality   had we ever been in a room with her. It is that power; that instinctive queenliness that made, and still makes, Queen Victoria so compelling. It is a quality that transcends beauty and the many romanticised film and TV versions of her.

At ten, she was a \"red rosebud with flying curls,\" and by age twelve, her governess deemed her \"very pretty,\" despite her consistently petite stature.\n\nAs she matured, Victoria's appearance evolved; her fair hair darkened, and her complexion, though good, flushed easily. While some found her mouth rather \"rabbity\" with small teeth, early portraits reveal a genuine prettiness, particularly when animated. Her most captivating feature, however, was her glorious smile, which, though rarely captured officially, was said to make her \"whole face laugh.\" Her voice, both spoken and in song, was universally admired for its \"sweet, bell-like tones\" and \"exquisite\" musicality, retaining its charm even in old age, described as \"a silver stream flowing over golden stones.\" Raised predominantly in a German-speaking household, she carried a distinct, though diminishing, German lilt throughout her life, peppering her speech with Teutonic inflections.\n\nBeyond physical attributes, Queen Victoria possessed an extraordinary presence and poise. Despite her lack of height, her \"admirable gait\" and regal bearing lent her an undeniable air of command, making her seem taller. She had a unique \"queenliness\" and a remarkable grace of movement, described as \"sailing\" across a room as if on skates, a skill perhaps honed by her lifelong love of dancing.\n\nHowever, the real Victoria's appearance became plainer and dumpier with numerous pregnancies and premature aging following Prince Albert's death at 42. Her blue eyes grew bulgier, her mouth turned down, and her chin merged into fleshy jowls, contributing to the austere image that endures. While modern cinematic portrayals, such as those by Emily Blunt or Jenna Coleman, often romanticize her youthful beauty, they frequently enhance her stature and conventional prettiness. The true power of Queen Victoria, which transcended any physical description and made her so compelling, lay in her formidable, commanding personality and an innate regality that few could ever match.",

        "content": "After the sudden and tragic death of Prince Albert in 1861, the grief-stricken Queen Victoria dedicated herself to memorialising her marriage as a perfect union. She herself composed large parts of the first biography, The Early Years of the Prince Consort (1867). At Frogmore, the royal burial ground at Windsor, she built a mausoleum and commissioned the sculptor Marochetti to create effigies of herself and the prince lying side-by-side   though it would be another 40 years before she would take her place beside her beloved Albert. Thanks, in part, to the queen s efforts, her marriage to Albert, prince of the German duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, came to be seen as one of the great love matches of all time, celebrated (with varying degrees of accuracy) in films such as The Young Victoria and, more recently, the ITV drama Victoria. Ad As Queen Victoria s journal shows, from the moment she saw the prince arriving at the foot of the staircase at Windsor in 1839, she was smitten. Five days later she summoned him to her blue closet and proposed to him. But the marriage was not the romantic happy-ever-after story that Victoria constructed. It was far more complex than that. Why did Victoria and Albert marry? Like all dynastic marriages, this was an alliance with a political agenda. As the second son of a minor German duke (Coburg is smaller than the Isle of Wight) and a mere Serene Highness, the lowest grade in the royal hierarchy, Prince Albert was Victoria s poor relation, although the two were first cousins. But what he lacked in rank and wealth, he made up for with education and self-confidence, and he had been trained from his teens by King Leopold of Belgium, the cousins  mutual uncle, to marry Victoria and take over the British throne. Listen to a recorded version of this article: Albert began his quest for power immediately after the marriage. Within months he had moved his writing desk next to the queen s. At first, Victoria resisted Albert s attempts to remove her trusted governess, Baroness Lehzen, from control of the court. But as one pregnancy followed another in quick succession   seven of Victoria s nine children were born in the first 10 years of the marriage   the queen was in no condition to resist. Albert fired Lehzen and assumed control of the household, introducing much-needed reforms and economies. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in a re-enactment of their marriage ceremony, 1854.

In November 1840, when her first child was born, Victoria gave Albert the key to the cabinet boxes. He started to attend meetings with ministers, dealing with the queen s correspondence and drafting business letters for the queen to copy out. At dinners with politicians, Albert could be heard prompting Victoria in German before she spoke. By now he had become her private secretary. In 1850 he described his position thus:  As the natural head of [the queen s] family, superintendent of her household, manager of her private affairs, sole confidential adviser in politics, and only assistant in her communications with the officers of her government, he is, besides, the husband of the queen, the tutor of the royal children, the private secretary of the sovereign, and her permanent minister.  Not only was Albert king in all but name but he intervened in politics, pursuing an active role in foreign policy.

Watch all episodes now In this five-part series, historian Tracy Borman charts the changing fortunes of the monarchy, from the bloody Norman conquest of 1066 through the upheaval of civil war in the 17th century to the reign of Elizabeth II. Victoria declared herself grateful to Albert for relieving her of the tiresome work of the sovereign. Women, she believed, were not fit to rule.  It is a reversal of the right order of things which distresses me much and which no one, but such a perfection, such an angel as he is   could bear and carry through.  But Victoria had a vein of steel, and her commitment to her birthright was absolute. She was torn between her passionate desire to be a perfect  Victorian  wife to Albert   an angel in the house, all sweetness and light   and her Hanoverian inheritance. How did Prince Albert craft the image of their marriage? The image of the Victorian monarchy, crafted by Albert, and projected in paintings such as Winterhalter s The Royal Family in 1846 was one of a child-centred bourgeois family on the throne. But the fact was that the royal marriage was unlike any other. It took place within the peculiar context of the court. As a young maid of honour in Victoria s court in the 1850s, Mary Bulteel would watch the door silently close on the queen s private apartments. How she longed to get to know the queen, her employer, but Victoria barely spoke to her. The withdrawal of the royal family from the public space of the court into the private apartments was Albert s doing. It meant that Victoria s life was no longer bounded by the court, as it had been in the early days of her reign, when her court was a Camelot, famed for its parties and youthful high spirits. The creation of a private sphere   of a space dedicated to domestic life   was one of the most far-reaching changes made by Albert in his drive to reform the monarchy. Disliking London with its late nights, and sneered at by the aristocracy as a German beggar, Albert persuaded Victoria that her enjoyment of society was wrong. True happiness, he claimed, was to be found in the country with her beloved prince and her young family. Albert designed the new family home at Osborne on the Isle of Wight, safely inaccessible from a prying public. Even more remote was Balmoral, the castle he created in the Scottish Highlands, 500 miles from London. At Osborne House or Balmoral, the family could live the simple outdoors life that Victoria later depicted in her Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands. Victoria believed her  happy domestic home  made her more popular than any other sovereign and gave a good example to her subjects. At court, Albert introduced new rules, distancing the royal family from the household   that is, the courtiers and officeholders such as the Lord Chamberlain. He ordered that no man was to sit in the presence of the queen. Throughout Victoria s reign, prime ministers stood during audiences; only two were accorded the special privilege of sitting in the queen s presence   her favourite Disraeli, who declined the offer, and Lord Salisbury, who was too heavy to stand. The hated Gladstone was never asked to sit, even in his eighties. At court, Albert introduced new rules, distancing the royal family from the household Albert forbade maids of honour from sitting in his presence or speaking to him unless spoken to. He went everywhere attended by an equerry, thus emphasising his royal status. In his relations with the courtiers of the household, Albert was cold and stiff.  His way of giving orders and reproofs was rather too like a master of a house scolding servants to be pleasant for those who were bound to listen in silence,  wrote Mary Bulteel. People noticed that the prince made not a single friend among ministers or the household. Such reserve in so young a man was  unpleasant , thought Mary:  It implied something of the cold egotism which seems to chill you in all royalties.  Memoirs of ladies-in-waiting concur that Albert was  detested  because he was  so stiff , especially with women. Victoria, on the other hand, was adored because of her disarming frankness and her unquenchable curiosity and interest in the affairs of everyone around her. Albert s cold manner derived in part from his upbringing at the small German court of Coburg. When Mary Bulteel visited Coburg in 1860, she found the court far stiffer than in Britain, and the equerries and household much more  collapsed before these little sovereigns than we are before the queen . One result of withdrawing from the court was that the royal couple were closer to their ordinary servants than they were to the aristocratic courtiers of the household. This is perhaps why, after Albert s death, Victoria became intimate first with her Highland servant John Brown, and later with her Indian servant Abdul Karim   relationships that the courtiers found especially upsetting because they overturned the protocol of the court.

Behind the closed doors of the private apartments, Victoria was often irritable and moody. She bitterly resented what she called  the shadow side of marriage , meaning pregnancy and childbirth, and she suffered from postnatal depression. She disliked babies, who she thought were  mere little plants for the first six months  and  frightful when undressed  with their  big body and little limbs and that terrible frog-like action . Victoria s  nerves  became worse during the 1850s. Her last two pregnancies were marked by hysterical scenes. Albert was advised by the royal doctors that the queen s mood swings and violent Hanoverian tempers were symptoms that she had inherited the madness of her grandfather George III. Rather than engage, he walked away and, as his wife stormed out of the room in a fury, the prince composed letters reprimanding her for unreasonable behaviour.  If you are violent I have no other choice but to leave you  and retire to my room in order to give you time to recover yourself, then you follow me to renew the dispute and have it all out,  he wrote. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, five years after their marriage. (Photo by Roger Fenton/Roger Fenton/Getty Images) Victoria kept a notebook in which she recorded her tempers, her selfishness, and her loss of self-control. Albert would read her confessions and issue her with a  certificate  of improvement, reviewing her behaviour as he might a child. Albert s intentions were no doubt good. He was certainly a loyal and faithful husband. Victoria s adoration of her beloved was undimmed. But she was made to feel that she was inadequate, his intellectual and moral inferior.  I owe everything to dearest papa,  she told her daughter.  He was my father, my protector, my guide and adviser in all and everything, my mother (I might almost say) as well as my husband.  This was not a marriage of equals. It was as if the only way the couple could live with the anomaly (as they saw it) of Victoria being a woman on the throne and superior in rank to her husband was by making her feel that she was Albert s inferior in every other respect. This artifice imposed unbearable stresses upon them both. Little wonder Victoria lost her temper now and then. Albert s reaction was to escape into work. In the 1850s he consistently rose early in the morning to deal with his growing amount of paperwork. His meddling in politics made him unpopular in the country, and he became a lonely, unhappy figure. Photographs show him prematurely aged, balding and careworn. Queen Victoria s tragedy was that Albert s death, aged 42, meant that these tensions were never resolved.

        "target_summary": "Shaken to her core by Prince Albert's untimely demise in 1861, Queen Victoria embarked on an almost sacred mission to immortalize their marriage as an unparalleled testament to perfect love. Through her deeply personal biography, the construction of a grand mausoleum at Frogmore, and the commission of serene effigies depicting them side-by-side, Victoria meticulously crafted an enduring narrative of a quintessential romance, a vision that has since permeated popular culture and historical understanding.\n\nYet, beneath this carefully burnished image lay a far more intricate reality. While the young Victoria, smitten upon their first meeting, boldly proposed to Albert, their union was primarily a dynastic alliance. Albert, though a \"poor relation\" and second son of a minor German duke, was a remarkably self-possessed and highly educated man, meticulously groomed by their mutual uncle, King Leopold of Belgium, for the very purpose of marrying Victoria and influencing the British throne.\n\nAlbert wasted no time in asserting his influence. Within months of their wedding, he strategically positioned himself at the heart of royal affairs. As Victoria navigated a rapid succession of pregnancies – bearing seven of her nine children in the first decade – her capacity to resist Albert's growing authority dwindled. He deftly ousted her trusted governess, Baroness Lehzen, and embarked on a comprehensive reform of the royal household, introducing efficiency and economy. His ascendancy continued unchecked: by 1840, he had gained access to cabinet papers, attended ministerial meetings, and effectively became Victoria's private secretary, drafting her official correspondence. By 1850, he boldly described himself as the queen's \"natural head,\" \"sole confidential adviser in politics,\" and \"permanent minister\" – a king in all but name, actively intervening in foreign policy. Victoria, surprisingly, expressed gratitude, believing women inherently unfit for the burdens of sovereignty, despite her own formidable will.\n\nBeyond political power, Albert meticulously sculpted the public image of the monarchy. He replaced the boisterous court of Victoria's early reign with an ideal of a child-centred, bourgeois domesticity, often depicted in grand paintings. To achieve this, he systematically withdrew the royal family from the public glare of the court into an intensely private sphere, establishing country retreats like Osborne and Balmoral – secluded havens far from London's late nights and the critical gaze of an aristocracy that often sneered at him as a \"German beggar.\" Within these private domains, the family could embrace a simpler, outdoorsy life, which Victoria later celebrated in her journals, believing it enhanced her popularity and set a moral example. Albert also enforced rigid new court rules, fostering an atmosphere of cold formality. Courtiers, including prime ministers, were forbidden from sitting in the queen's presence, and Albert himself maintained a chilling reserve, earning him widespread dislike for his stiff, authoritative manner, a stark contrast to Victoria's adored frankness. This deliberate distancing, ironically, cultivated closer ties between the royal couple and their ordinary servants, a dynamic that would profoundly shape Victoria's later intimate relationships with John Brown and Abdul Karim.\n\nYet, behind the closed doors of their private apartments, the carefully constructed façade often fractured. Victoria grappled with profound irritability, postnatal depression, and a deep resentment for the \"shadow side of marriage\" – pregnancy and childbirth, even admitting to disliking babies. Her notorious \"Hanoverian tempers\" flared, escalating to \"hysterical scenes\" by the 1850s, which doctors ominously linked to her grandfather George III's madness. Albert's response was often cold and detached; he would retreat and reprimand her in letters, treating her emotional outbursts with a chilling pedagogy, even issuing \"certificates\" of improvement for her recorded confessions. Victoria, in turn, felt intellectually and morally inferior, viewing Albert as her \"father, protector, guide, and even mother.\" Theirs was not a partnership of equals, but an unequal artifice designed to reconcile the perceived \"anomaly\" of a powerful queen with a husband of lesser rank, placing immense psychological strain on them both. Albert, escaping into ceaseless work, became a lonely and careworn figure, his early aging evident in photographs. His premature death at 42 tragically ensured these deep-seated tensions remained forever unresolved, leaving Victoria to mourn not just a husband, but the linchpin of her carefully constructed world.",

        "content": "Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert, were passionate lovers with a mutual physical attraction but with seemingly no understanding of family planning. The result was nine children born between 1840 and 1857. Albert, intelligent and ambitious, was determined to put this burgeoning brood to good use. He and Victoria were united in the desire that they should not just be a model, loving and happy family, but that they would also set a moral example that would redefine royalty and be the foundation of a dynasty that would stretch across Europe, bringing peace and harmony to the fractious continent. Ad It was a noble plan, motivated by the highest ideals, and one that was to lead to the creation of the modern idea of the royal family so familiar to us today. But like so many of the best-laid plans, human nature got in the way. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert surrounded by some of their children at Windsor Castle. In the group are Princess Victoria; the future King Edward VII (as a young prince); Prince Alfred, Princess Alice and Princess Helena.

(GL Archive/Alamy Stock Photo) It was Albert, the intellectual, who was responsible for shaping and modernising the royal family in the 19th century; his influence would last well into the next. From the moment of his marriage to Victoria in 1840 to his untimely death 21 years later, he saw his purpose as protecting and nourishing the British monarchy at a time when political turmoil threatened at home and revolution was sweeping Europe. Albert believed that in order to survive and prosper, royalty should be presented as a respectable and close- knit, loving family. As the historian Miranda Carter says:  It s as if Albert and Victoria are trying to reach out to their middle class subjects and say,  look, we are like you, trust us .  But of course the royal family was not like the middle class. It existed in the enclosed bubble of the court where tensions and hostilities festered and where children were fawned over and flattered from the moment they were born. Yet at the same time these youngsters were expected to be model children, utterly obedient to their parents. It was an intolerable tension. Troubled childhoods A fraught family life was perhaps unsurprising, given the couple s own experiences. They were both the product of unhappy childhoods. Albert s upbringing in Germany had been overshadowed by the breakdown of his parents  marriage. His father, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfield (and then, from 1826, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) was a serial philanderer who paid little attention to his son. Albert grew up longing for his father s love while detesting his behaviour. He was determined when the time came to be a model father and everything that his father was not. But when he became a parent the problem was that he had no example to follow. Victoria, too, had much to react against. She had grown up secluded at Kensington Palace under the control of her domineering mother, the Duchess of Kent. Later she admitted, revealingly,  I had led a very unhappy life as a child   had no scope for my very violent feelings of affection  and did not know what a happy domestic life was .

(Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) The couple, deeply in love and physically well suited, were united in the wish to create a family that would serve not just as an escape from their own unhappy pasts, but also as a pan-European dynasty and a model for a nation. Unsurprisingly, given the couple s physical infatuation, their first child, Princess Victoria, called Vicky, was born nine months after their wedding. The queen was busy with her duties as monarch and could spare little time for her baby, seeing her only twice a day. Within a year of Vicky s birth Albert Edward, known as Bertie   the future King Edward VII   was born. The queen now had a healthy male heir.  Our little boy is a wonderfully strong and large child,  she wrote proudly.  I hope and pray he may be like his dearest Papa.  With the succession reasonably assured, it might be thought a rest from the risk of childbearing would be appropriate. Not so. Over the next five years another three children were born: Alice, Alfred and Helena. While Queen Victoria gave birth to many children, she hated being pregnant, and historians have suggested that she may have suffered from post-natal depression. She compared pregnancy to feeling like a cow and wrote that  an ugly baby is a very nasty object   and the prettiest is frightful when undressed . Nor did Victoria necessarily like babies.  An ugly baby is a very nasty object,  she protested,  the prettiest are frightful when undressed  as long as they have their big body and little limbs and that terrible froglike action . Nor could she contemplate breastfeeding them, finding the whole process repulsive. A wet nurse was therefore employed for all her children, as Victoria devoted herself to Albert. The result was four more children: Louise, Arthur, Leopold and Beatrice. Victoria had nine babies over 17 years   a tremendous physical feat, and a dangerous one given the high rates of maternal mortality at the time.

(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The model family The royal couple set to work putting their plan for a model family into action. It was essential for them also that they were seen to be doing so. With the birth of mass communication, Albert well understood the need for the public to be made aware of the ideal for which they were striving. Under the Hanoverians the monarchy had fallen into disrepute, torn apart by feuding and scandal. Now, in countless paintings and photographs, Victoria and Albert were shown in harmonious family group portraits. Today they are a lovely record, if not a strictly true one, of the development of the royal family. The publicity worked and Victoria was delighted:  They say no Sovereign was ever more loved than I (I am bold enough to say), and this because of our happy domestic home and the good example it presents . In a reversal of the typical roles of the time, Victoria devoted herself to regal duties while Albert took responsibility for the upbringing of the children. He was a new type of father, ahead of his time, with a hands-on approach to child rearing. From the beginning his relationship with his first child, Vicky, went well. Lady Lyttleton, a governess, remembered seeing him playing with her:  Albert tossed and romped with her, making her laugh and crow and kick heartily . Victoria, by contrast, was far more distant and guarded. She looked on as Albert took control of all aspects of the children s development. At first Albert found this task fulfilling and stimulating, appealing to his sense of himself as an expert in human behaviour:  There is certainly a great charm, as well as deep interest, in watching the development of feelings and faculties in a little child,  he once remarked. Prince Albert with Princess Victoria and Eos, c1843. (Photo by English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images) An education Albert was the product of an intensive German education that had made him into an accomplished polymath. He expected the same of his children   and more. He developed a punishing educational programme to create the model prince or princess that took little account of the abilities of an average intellect. According to Baron Stockmar, his advisor, the regime would give any child brain fever. The plan began when the children were infants, with the instilling of discipline.  The chief objects here,  the prince opined,  are their physical development, the actual rearing up, the training to obedience . Corporal punishment was at the heart of this training. The children frequently received  a real punishment by whipping  if they stepped out of line and Albert himself would hit his children s fingers during piano lessons when they played the wrong notes. There was instruction, too, in manners and, as the children grew older, lessons in the languages of the courts of Europe, especially German and French. On top of this there was tuition in Latin, geography, maths and science. The education would have been tough even for the most able child, but for the mostly very average young princes and princesses it was purgatory. Fortunately Vicky, the eldest child, was extremely bright and the strict regime got off to a good start. She began her French lessons at the tender age of 18 months; soon she was speaking Latin and reading Shakespeare. Naturally, given her parents  heritage, she was also fluent in German. The queen fully backed her husband s plan. She idolised him to the children, telling them  none of you can ever be proud enough of being the child of such a father who has not his equal in this world . It followed that she would want them, especially the boys, to be brought up as mini-replicas of the man she adored so ardently. She prayed that her baby Bertie would grow up to  resemble his angelic dearest Father in every, every respect, both in body and mind . Of course, life being what it is, the heir to the throne turned out in every respect to be the opposite of his father. His parents believed he could be a blank slate on which they could draw a perfect little Albert   they were utterly wrong. From an early age Bertie obstinately refused to conform to his father s plan for the royal children s education. Here was no renaissance prince in the making: despite being stuffed with facts and theory he found learning difficult and was unable to concentrate. The intense pressure on the backward young prince produced a negative reaction. His tutor Frederick Gibbs remembered the frequent schoolroom tantrums during arithmetic lessons with the Prince of Wales:  He became passionate, the pencil was flung to the end of the room, the stool was kicked away and he was hardly able to apply himself at all . Albert s plan for the heir to the throne of the greatest empire the world had ever seen turned out a complete failure. Instead of the longed for polymath his son turned out to be a dunce. Victoria complained about his  systematic idleness, laziness   disregard of everything . The worried parents consulted a phrenologist, a modish quack who claimed the shape of the head affected the brain. His diagnosis confirmed everything they feared:  The feeble quality of the brain will render the Prince highly excitable  intellectual organs are only moderately well developed. The result will be strong self-will, at times obstinacy . Queen Victoria's son Albert Edward, Prince of Wales   the future King Edward VII   in 1870. (Photo by J Russell & Sons/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The Prince of Wales was not the only one of the nine children who played up and refused to conform to Albert s plan for a perfect royal development. As each grew up, he or she displayed the quirks and characteristics of individual human nature. Albert was perplexed and dismayed and he came to suspect that his children were suffering from their Stuart inheritance   certainly they could not have inherited their frailties and foibles from his princely blood! But the plan had to go on. Royal marriages As time passed, eight of the children were married off to European princes and princesses, in order that a pan-European dynasty be created. First to go was Princess Victoria, the eldest, to Fritz of Prussia. Both parents were devastated to lose their 17-year-old, especially Albert who wrote  the pang of parting was great on all sides, and the void which Vicky has left in our household and family circle will stand gaping for many a day . But dynastic duty had to override human feeling, and his favourite daughter was taken away to a new and bewildering life in the Prussian court. Princess Beatrice, the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria, who married Prince Henry of Battenberg in 1885. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The pressure on Albert to carry out all his many royal duties and to bring up the family according to his plan was immense. He found his work exhausting. In 1860 he compared himself to a donkey on a treadmill, complaining:  He, too, would rather munch thistles in the castle moat. Small are the thanks he gets for his labour . Victoria, ever self-centred and emotional, came to resent the attention he paid to the children. There were frequent outbursts and marital rows. The strain took its toll on the Prince Consort s health. He suffered toothache, insomnia and fits of shivering. The doctors were mystified, unable to make a proper diagnosis. Victoria failed to empathise with her husband. In one of her many letters to her daughter Vicky, she wrote:  Dear Papa never allows he is any better or will try to get over it, but makes such a miserable face that people always think he is very ill . Albert soldiered on, desperate to realise his vision for the royal family. In 1860 he arranged the key dynastic marriage of the Prince of Wales to Princess Alexandra of Denmark. In a changing world it was crucial that this be portrayed both as a worthwhile diplomatic alliance (which it was), and a love match. The Victorian public, in an era of pious rectitude, demanded a pure marriage in which the heir to the throne appeared to be virtuous and chaste. The Prince of Wales, however, was anything but chaste. His life from an early age was devoted to pleasure, much to his parent s desperate alarm. In the summer of 1861 Bertie attended a training camp with Grenadier Guards in Dublin. His fellow officers arranged for a  lady of easy virtue  to join him for the night. The story of the prince s trysts got back to his parents and provoked in Albert a furious, almost hysterical, response. How could his son, he demanded,  thrust yourself into the hands of one of the most abject of the human species, to be by her initiated in the sacred mysteries of creation? . Everything that Albert had been working for seemed threatened. He warned Bertie that  you must not, you dare not be lost; the consequences for this country and the world at large would be too dreadful . A tragic death Albert s plan for perfect children seemed to have failed utterly. Sickening and feverish, Albert travelled to meet the Prince of Wales at Cambridge to harangue him on the error of his ways. Father and son went for a long walk in the rain. Bertie apologised, Albert forgave and then returned to Windsor wet through, racked with pain in his legs and suffering from fever. He retired to bed, where his symptoms worsened. In December 1861, aged only 42, he died. Queen Victoria s grief was so great that it would dominate her family and the nation for decades to come. And of course she blamed her eldest son Bertie for her beloved s death. For years she could hardly bear to bring herself even to look at him. Queen Victoria at Balmoral with her daughters Princess Alice and Princess Louise and a portrait of her late husband, Prince Albert. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) With Albert s death the idea of raising perfect children died too. Victoria managed as best she could, relying on her position as queen and her domineering character to make her children bend to her will. In this she was generally successful, though she and the Prince of Wales gave each other a wide berth. And her many letters show she was   if a mixture of egocentric martinet and self-pitying widow   always at heart a loving mother. Like all parents before and after, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert learned that children have an extraordinary ability to perplex, frustrate and amaze at their individuality and their obstinate refusal to turn into little paragons. Years later Victoria was honest enough to say this herself in a surprising yet characteristic admission:  You will find as your children grow up that as a rule your children are a bitter disappointment   their greatest object being to do precisely what their parents do not wish and have anxiously tried to prevent . The great matriarch concluded with an eternal truth that it had taken her years to come to appreciate that  often when children have been less watched and less taken care of   the better they turn out! This is inexplicable and very annoying! . Certainly her own children, in the main, turned out well enough despite the untimely death of their father and the failure of his plan. Even Bertie, a libertine and prince of pleasure, was as Edward VII a very successful king whose easy charm and diplomatic skills ensured the continuing popularity of the British royal family and brought Britain closer to France on the eve of the catastrophe of the First World War. In a surprising and all too human way, Albert s plan had worked out after all. Denys Blakeway is a documentary producer and writer.

Albert's childhood was overshadowed by his philandering father's neglect, while Victoria endured a secluded and unhappy life under her domineering mother's strict control, confessing she \"had no scope for [her] very violent feelings of affection.\" United in their desire to escape these fraught pasts, they sought to create a vastly different family life. Yet, Victoria notoriously disliked pregnancy, comparing herself to a \"cow\" and describing even the prettiest babies as \"frightful when undressed.\" Consequently, she delegated the physical care of her many offspring to wet nurses, dedicating herself instead to Albert and her regal duties.\n\nAlbert, in stark contrast, adopted a remarkably hands-on, albeit strict, approach to child-rearing, an unusual stance for a father of his era. Believing in absolute obedience and physical development, he devised a punishing educational program. This rigorous curriculum, deemed by an advisor to be capable of giving any child \"brain fever,\" included corporal punishment, extensive language lessons, Latin, geography, maths, and science. He expected his children to be accomplished polymaths, just like himself. Their eldest daughter, Princess Victoria (\"Vicky\"), an exceptionally bright child, thrived under this system. Victoria fully supported Albert's vision, idolising him and praying her son Bertie would become a \"mini-replica\" of his \"angelic dearest Father.\"\n\nHowever, human nature proved a formidable obstacle to this meticulously crafted plan. Albert Edward, \"Bertie,\" the future King Edward VII, stubbornly refused to conform. Despite immense pressure and constant instruction, he found learning difficult, struggled with concentration, and often threw \"passionate\" tantrums. Far from the renaissance prince his father desperately wanted, Bertie was perceived as a \"dunce\" by his parents, who even consulted a phrenologist whose bleak diagnosis confirmed their fears of his \"feeble quality of the brain\" and \"strong self-will.\" This disappointment was compounded as other children, despite being strategically married off to European royalty to fulfill the dynastic ambition, also displayed their individual quirks, perplexing and dismaying Albert.\n\nThe relentless demands of his public duties and the crushing burden of his unfulfilled family aspirations severely eroded Albert's health. He felt like a \"donkey on a treadmill,\" receiving \"small thanks\" for his labour, and suffered from insomnia and illness, all while Victoria, often self-centred, failed to fully empathize. The strain reached a tragic peak when Albert, in a furious, almost hysterical response, confronted Bertie over a youthful indiscretion. This emotionally charged meeting, conducted during a long, wet walk, seemingly triggered Albert's final decline. He died in December 1861 at the age of 42, his grand plan for perfect children seemingly a tragic failure. Victoria’s monumental grief cast a long shadow, leading her to unjustly blame her eldest son for decades.\n\nYet, despite the anguish and perceived setbacks, Albert's vision ultimately succeeded in a surprising, very human way. Victoria, as a mature matriarch, eventually conceded that children often prove a \"bitter disappointment,\" preferring to \"do precisely what their parents do not wish.\" She noted, with a mixture of annoyance and wisdom, that children \"less watched and less taken care of\" often \"turn out better!\" Indeed, her \"dunce\" son Bertie, the \"libertine and prince of pleasure,\" ascended the throne as Edward VII and proved a remarkably successful king. His easy charm and diplomatic skills, cultivated outside his father's rigid program, ensured the monarchy's enduring popularity and played a crucial role in forging stronger Anglo-French relations on the eve of the First World War. Albert's ambitious blueprint, though fraught with personal heartache and unforeseen deviations, ultimately transformed the British monarchy into the relatable and enduring institution we know today.",

        "content": "Overlooking Bruges  market square and a few hundred metres away from the neo-Gothic Provincial Palace stands a popular chain hotel, providing accommodation for some of the millions of tourists that visit the Belgian city each year. Ad Looking at this unremarkable redbrick building, it s hard to imagine that on the same site, an important place of worship once towered over this historic metropolis: the medieval St Donatian s Church. And a new detail that has emerged from the archives of the church leads us to consider something even harder to imagine: could the crown of England s last Anglo-Saxon king, Harold Godwinson, have been sold to pay for its upkeep? A church of sanctuary and sacrilege St Donatian s church   named after the fourth-century French saint, Donatian   was established around AD 950 by Arnulf I, the count of Flanders. Prior to its destruction during the French Revolutionary Wars, the church was a college of canons, built to hold relics of St Donatian brought to Bruges from Torhout (a municipality in West Flanders) in around 870. An illustration of St Donatian's in Flandria Illustrata, 1641 (Public domain) Today, the church is best-known for being the scene of the brutal murder of another Flemish count, Charles the Good, who was attacked by a group of knights in 1127. Lesser-known, however, is the fact that the place of worship also played a significant role in the exile of Lady Gunhild   sister of the last Anglo-Saxon king, Harold Godwinson. The church became Gunhild s final resting place, and recent research by Elisabeth van Houts, emeritus honorary professor of medieval history at the University of Cambridge, suggests that it may have greatly benefited from the spoils of the Norman Conquest. A family in exile It is one of the most famous tales in English history, detailed on the Bayeux Tapestry and depicted in BBC drama King and Conqueror: William of Normandy s defeat of Harold Godwinson at the battle of Hastings. It fundamentally changed England s political and social landscape, bringing with it a new language, new power structures and the eventual creation of the first national survey, Domesday Book. Domesday Book, the first national survey and only contemporary document to discuss Gunhild (Image by Alamy) Harold was killed in the fighting, as was his brother, Tostig Godwinson, at the preceding battle of Stamford Bridge. But what happened to Harold s surviving family after the Norman Conquest? The dramatic events of 1066 didn t just end the Anglo-Saxon era and Harold s life   they scattered his relatives across Europe. The king s sister, Gunhild, and their mother, Gytha, fled England for Saint-Omer in Flanders, with Gunhild later moving on to Bruges. In 1786, almost 700 years after her death, the tomb of Gunhild was uncovered in St Donatian s Church. Her tomb included a burial plaque alongside a long Latin obituary detailing her life in exile. Such details reveal that Gunhild lived a pious and simple existence in Bruges, where  she was abstained from all pleasures  and  did not eat anything that seemed sweet to her but instead took only enough to stay alive . From this description, you would be forgiven for thinking that Gunhild lived in poverty, but in reality, she was still extremely wealthy. Indeed, the only contemporary document to discuss Gunhild, Domesday Book, reveals her vast riches, indicating that she  held the income of four manors, one in Sussex and three in Somerset, comprising approximately 30 hides, giving her an annual income of just under  30 . A Bayeux Tapestry scene depicts the famous Battle of Hastings defeat of King Harold (Public domain) Much of this wealth would have been confiscated and redistributed by the Norman invaders, but Gunhild once again came into money upon her mother s death. According to Elisabeth van Houts,  we can get some idea of [the size of Gunhild s wealth] from the archive of St Donatian, which in the 14th century kept records of her bequest of gold and silver to the canons .  | How well did Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror know each other prior to the battle of Hastings? Given that the bequest was still being written about some 300 years after Gunhild s death suggests that it was clearly of great importance. So much so, in fact, that the canons of the late 11th century had even buried Gunhild in the church as a sign of their gratitude. Relic in the roof? So   why were the canons so thankful for this bequest in particular? Van Houts  research suggests that some of the gifts were no less than crown jewels. According to records from 1389,  the sale of certa jocalia ( certain jewels  or  precious objects ) given by Lady Gunhild for the repair of the church s roof, vault and choir  were approved by the Bishop of Tournai. Antonius Schoonhoven   a canon of St Donatian s   concluded that in Gunhild s bequests, there  were among others an imperial crown (corona augustalis) and many works of the best authors richly ornamented . In other words, the crown of Gunhild s brother, Harold, may well have been bequeathed to the canons of St Donatian s before being sold to fund vital works on the church. A 13th-century manuscript illustration shows Harold Godwinson being crowned as King of England, a pivotal moment in English history (Image by Alamy) We may never know the truth of the matter, but as Van Houts points out,  monastic houses acted as banks providing loans and mortgages from the 11th century  [and] the canons of St Donatian at Bruges would have expected to receive charitable donations from the English noblewomen . Therefore, it is possible that Gunhild gifted the canons these precious possessions not merely as a sign of gratitude, but because she was expected to do so. Yet even if we don t know the exact circumstances, the items would have likely been of huge personal value to Gunhild   both financially and emotionally. Historians have long speculated on what happened to Harold s crown after the battle of Hastings, and there are no known confirmed records of its whereabouts beyond 1066. However, this insight into Gunhild s fate after 1066 raises the tantalising possibility that it might have ended up with her in Bruges, rather than finding its way into the hands of the Normans.

This medieval college of canons, founded around AD 950 and renowned for housing relics and witnessing Count Charles the Good's 1127 murder, may hold an even more astonishing secret. Recent archival discoveries suggest an incredible possibility: the crown of England's last Anglo-Saxon king, Harold Godwinson, might have been sold to fund its ancient upkeep.\n\nFollowing Harold Godwinson's devastating defeat and death at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, his family scattered across Europe. His sister, Lady Gunhild, fled to Flanders, finding her final resting place within St Donatian's. Though her tomb's obituary depicted a pious, simple life, Domesday Book records reveal she was a woman of considerable wealth, holding income from multiple manors despite Norman confiscation. She later inherited significant assets from her mother. Gunhild's substantial bequest of gold and silver to the canons was so considerable it was recorded for centuries, securing her an honoured burial within the church.\n\nNew research by Elisabeth van Houts suggests these gifts included objects of royal significance – specifically, crown jewels. Fourteenth-century archives approve the sale of \"certain jewels\" from Gunhild for essential repairs to the church's roof, vault, and choir. A canon of St Donatian's later confirmed that among Gunhild's treasures were \"an imperial crown\" and richly ornamented works. This astounding revelation suggests King Harold's crown, whose fate after 1066 has long been a historical mystery, could have been entrusted to his sister. She, in turn, may have gifted these deeply personal and valuable possessions to the canons, who then sold them to maintain their revered church. This tantalising possibility places one of England's most potent symbols of Anglo-Saxon kingship not in Norman hands, but repurposed within a Flemish church.",

        "title": "The truth about Viking berserkers",
        "content": "There were few established military institutions in Scandinavia at the start of the Viking Age, circa 800, but a number of such organisations gradually developed as society came increasingly under the rule of a single king. The foremost institution was the retinue, a brotherhood of warriors serving a common master. It developed to become the main source of power for the medieval kings and evolved into a noble elite in the Middle Ages. Ad But there was a more sinister brotherhood of warriors in Scandinavia that could not find any place in the post-heathen world of Christianity. Instead it only survived in the realm of the sagas, the art and the folklore, often becoming shield-biting demons of war and symbols of evildoing. But behind the myth and the shroud of history, the sources reveal the existence of men thriving on the border between life and death, fuelled by war and distinguished by their ecstatic battle fury. The description of  berserkers  and  wolfskins  in the sources is on the boundary between fantasy and reality, and it is difficult for us today to imagine that such people can have ever existed, possessed of incontrollable destructive power. But they did. The berserkers and the wolfskins (also known as  heathen wolves ) were a special group of very skilled and dangerous warriors associated with the god Odin. Vikings: Valhalla   the real history behind Netflix's successor to Vikings Netflix's Vikings: Valhalla brings a new generation of Viking schemers and dreamers to the screen, from explorers Leif Erikson and Freyd s Eir ksd ttir to warrior Harald Sigurdsson and empire-builder King Cnut. Here s what s what to expect from the show, plus the real history that underpins the story How might berserkers have fought in wars? If there were elite troops such as berserkers and wolfskins available on the battlefield, they were put in the front of the phalanx [a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely of heavy infantry] to resist the main weight of an attack, or at the front when launching an attack. But berserker troops could be a double-edged sword, as they were difficult to control in a battle and were often ill-suited to formation warfare. Instead, they seem to prefer to operate in smaller groups, attacking independently. Olav Haraldsson (St Olav) put the berserkers in front of his own phalanx at the battle of Stiklestad in the year 1030, but instead of holding the line they attacked and thereby contributed to the king s downfall. This marginal illumination from the Saga of Saint Olaf shows his death at the battle of Stiklestad in 1030. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) Viking warriors looked to the god Odin to give them aggression and courage in battle, but the berserkers took this a step further. According to the sources they could rout an outnumbering force, and when they attacked they howled like mad dogs or wolves. It was said that neither iron nor fire could injure them, and they didn t know pain. After a battle they were as weak as infants, totally spent both physically and psychologically. It is difficult to find any clear difference between a berserker and a wolfskin. Sometimes they appear to be the same, under the general description of berserker, and at other times they are portrayed as two different types of warrior. In some contexts, the wolfskins are even more closely connected with the Odin cult than the berserkers seem to be. A brotherhood of war Originally berserkers developed their own brotherhood of professional warriors who travelled round and took service with different chiefs. What distinguished them was that they had bears and wolves as totem animals, and clad themselves in their skins. Irrespective of whether it was a bear or a wolf, the warriors believed they were endowed with the spirit of the animal. Designs showing warriors clad in what could be bearskins occur, among other places, on the Torslund plates from  land, thought to date from the seventh century. In the Fornalder sagas ( Sagas of Earlier Times ) and in several other sagas, the king s or the chieftain s guard is described as made up of berserkers, usually 12 in number. The berserkers often comprised an elite troop in addition to the guard or the army in general. In sea battles they were usually stationed at the prow, to take the leading point of an attack. In the battle of Hafrsfjord, c872, they appear as shock troops for Harald H rfagre (Finehair), in groups of 12. The berserkers are spoken of as fearsome enemies to meet. They were often said to be so intoxicated by battle-lust that they bit their shields, attacked boulders and trees and even killed each other while they were waiting for battles to begin. A set of chessmen from the 12th century found on the Isle of Lewis in the Scottish Hebrides includes a chess piece of a warrior biting his shield. The title of berserker is thought sometimes to have been inherited from father to son, and there are known examples of entire families of berserkers. One such family known from the sagas is Egil Skallagrimson. Egil s father, Skallagrim ( ugly skull ), and his grandfather Kveldulv ( nightwolf ) were also berserkers. The concept of  berserk  also turns up independently of  berserker . The idea of  going berserk  could apply to more than just the members of a warrior brotherhood. Harald Hardr de (Hardruler)  went berserk  at the 1066 battle of Stamford Bridge, for example. The expression is also used in relation to warriors who are not thought to have been wearing any distinctive uniform of animal skins. Olav Haraldsson s berserkers, who wrecked the battle of Stiklestad for him, are an example of this. King Harold II, the Saxon king of Britain, beholds the body of his rebellious brother Tostig, whom he has just defeated at the battle of Stamford Bridge, 1066. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) What's the earliest evidence of berserkers? The earliest written sources of what might be berserkers are found in Roman writings from the first century AD. In his book Germania, the historian Tacitus describes correspondingly fantastic elite warriors among the German tribes in northern Europe. In the sixth century, the East Roman historian Prokopios wrote of  the wild and lawless heruli  from the north, describing how they went almost naked into battle, clad only in loincloths   this was to show disdain for their wounds. They wore neither helmet nor coat of mail, and used only a light shield to protect themselves. The people who were described as  heruli  probably had their origin on Sj land or Fyn in today s Denmark, but they can also be traced to other parts of Scandinavia, including Norway. The heruli are said to have had a kingdom on Fyn. This may have survived until into the sixth century, but more of them had previously been driven out of Scandinavia by the Danes. The heruli often took service as warrior bands in the Roman army. They appeared in the same way as the berserkers, in small groups in the service of chieftains or kings, and there is a possibility that the origins of the berserkers may be found among the mysterious heruli. The Vikings | A short course from HistoryExtra Academy Member exclusive | Join Professor Ryan Lavelle for our four-week course on the Vikings   from trading and exploring to daily life. Explore the course now The berserkers are often mentioned in sagas, skaldic poems [composed at the courts of Scandinavian and Icelandic leaders during the Viking and Middle Ages] and other literature from the Middle Ages. In the sagas, which were written in a Christian context, the memory of these warriors has been extended to become a label for those who stand out from the norms of society: thugs and freebooters, pirates and so on. In the earliest Icelandic compendium of law, Gr g s, it is said that a raging berserker can either be bound or condemned to exile. The oldest known written source about berserkers is Haraldskvadet, a 9th-century skaldic poem honouring King Harald, attributed to the skaldic poet Torbj rn Hornklove. Writing about the battle of Hafrsfjord [date unknown], he writes:  Berserkers roared where the battle raged, wolf-heathens howled and iron weapons trembled . Battle of Hafrsfjord. (World History Archive/Alamy Stock Photo) In Grette s Saga it is said of the warriors in that same battle:   such berserkers as were called wolf-heathens; they had wolf-coverings as mail  and iron didn t bite them; one of them  started roaring and bit the edge of his shield  and growled viciously . In the Volsung Saga, describing events in the sixth century, it is said that the berserkers were in Odin s lifeguard and that they  went without armour, were as mad as dogs and wolves, they bit their shields, were as strong as bears or oxen, they killed everybody, and neither fire nor iron bit them; this is called going berserk . The descriptions in the sagas of violent men and killers cannot all be linked to the berserkers, however. Distinctions are made, for example, between  berserkers  and  warriors,  and between  normal  killers and men who fought duels. And the Old Norse saga texts never call the berserkers mad or insane. They regard the berserkers as something more than just socially problematic and unusually aggressive. The sagas distinguish them from other men by ascribing to them a particular  nature  that made one both scornful and fearful of them at the same time. 'Going berserk': what's the mushroom theory? In 1784 a priest named  dmann started a theory that  going berserk  was the result of eating fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria). That explanation gradually became more popular, and remains so today.  dmann based his hypothesis on reports about Siberian shamans, but it is important to note that he had no personal observations of the effects of eating this type of mushroom. White agaric has also been suggested as a cause of the berserk fury, but considering how poisonous this is, it is quite unthinkable that it would be eaten. Eating agaric mushrooms can lead to depression and can make the user apathetic, in addition to its hallucinogenic effects. Berserkers are certainly never described as apathetic! Poisoning with the fungus Claviceps purpurea has also been suggested   it contains a compound used to synthesise the hallucinogen LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide). However, if mushrooms had been so important for the berserkers, they would surely have been mentioned in the sagas, which they are not. The most probable explanation for  going berserk  comes from psychiatry. The theory is that the groups of warriors, through ritual processes carried out before a battle (such as biting the edges of their shields), went into a self-induced hypnotic trance. In this dissociative state they lost conscious control of their actions, which are then directed subconsciously. People in this state seem remote, have little awareness of their surroundings and have reduced awareness of pain and increased muscle strength. Critical thinking and normal social inhibitions weaken, but the people affected are not unconscious. Fly Agaric mushroom. (Photo by Eye Ubiquitous/UIG via Getty Images) This condition of psychomotor automatism possibly resembles what in forensic psychiatry is described as  diminished responsibility . The condition is followed by a major emotional catharsis in the form of tiredness and exhaustion, sometimes followed by sleep. Researchers think that the short-term aim of the trance may have been to achieve an abreaction of strong aggressive, destructive and sadistic impulses in a socially defined role. The Old Norse social order and religion were able to accommodate this type of behaviour, and it is understandable that the phenomenon disappeared after the introduction of Christianity. A Christian society considered such rituals and actions as demonic and thought that they must have resulted from supernatural influences.

        "target_summary": "In the nascent Viking Age, around 800, Scandinavia saw the slow rise of structured military institutions like the king's retinue, a disciplined brotherhood destined for noble status. Yet, a more primal and sinister brotherhood thrived alongside them: the formidable berserkers and wolfskins. These elite warriors, whose ecstatic battle fury and wild independence found no place in the emerging Christian world, survive primarily in the dramatic sagas and folklore, often portrayed as fearsome, shield-biting demons of war.\n\nDelving beyond myth, historical accounts paint a picture of men who lived on the edge, fueled by war and distinguished by their uncontrollable, god-given frenzy. Closely associated with Odin, berserkers were highly skilled, dangerous combatants. While today it's hard to imagine such figures, sources confirm their existence, describing their perceived invulnerability to iron and fire during their rage, and their subsequent, profound exhaustion.\n\nOn the battlefield, berserkers were typically placed at the vanguard, leading assaults or absorbing the enemy's charge. However, their intense, individualistic style proved a double-edged sword; ill-suited to rigid formation warfare, they often preferred independent, smaller group actions. A stark illustration of this came at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030, where King Olav Haraldsson's berserkers broke formation, prematurely attacking and ultimately contributing to his defeat.\n\nTheir unique connection to Odin manifested in a legendary battle-frenzy, with reports of them howling like wolves and routing superior forces. This supernatural power, however, exacted a heavy toll, leaving them as weak as infants, utterly spent physically and psychologically, after the fighting ceased. Berserkers distinguished themselves by wearing the skins of their totem animals—bears or wolves—believing they were imbued with the animal's spirit. These warriors, sometimes numbering twelve, served as elite guards or shock troops, often stationed at the perilous prow of longships during naval engagements, as seen with Harald Finehair's forces at Hafrsfjord. Their battle-lust was so extreme they were said to bite their shields, attack inanimate objects, and even turn on each other awaiting combat, a scene eerily captured in a 12th-century Lewis chess piece. The berserker title could even be inherited, with entire families, like Egil Skallagrimson's, known for their lineage of raging warriors.\n\nThe earliest echoes of berserker-like fighters appear in 1st-century Roman accounts of \"fantastic elite warriors\" among Germanic tribes and 6th-century descriptions of the \"wild and lawless Heruli,\" who fought nearly naked, disdainful of wounds. Mentioned frequently in Viking Age skaldic poetry and medieval sagas, the berserkers' place in society shifted dramatically with the advent of Christianity. Sagas, written in a Christian context, began to redefine these once-revered warriors as social outcasts—thugs, freebooters, and pirates. Early Icelandic law even prescribed exile for a raging berserker, marking their decline as their ecstatic, pagan rituals became viewed as demonic and unacceptable by the new Christian order.\n\nThe enduring mystery of \"going berserk\" has led to various theories. The 18th-century notion of fly agaric mushroom consumption, though popularized, lacks historical evidence and pharmacological consistency. Instead, the most compelling explanation comes from psychiatry: berserkers likely induced a self-hypnotic trance through pre-battle rituals like shield-biting. In this dissociative state, they experienced psychomotor automatism—a loss of conscious control, diminished pain awareness, heightened strength, and weakened inhibitions. This trance provided a socially sanctioned outlet for aggressive impulses within the pagan religious framework. With Christianity's arrival, such 'demonic' practices lost their cultural acceptance, providing a clear explanation for the eventual fading of these fearsome, ecstatic warriors from the battlefield and into the realm of myth.",

        "content": "In 793, terror descended on the coast of Northumbria as armed raiders attacked the defenceless monastery of St Cuthbert on Lindisfarne. The terrified monks watched helplessly as the invaders made off with a haul of treasure and a clutch of captives. It was the first recorded raid by the Vikings, seaborne pirates from Scandinavia who would prey on coastal communities in north-western Europe for more than two centuries during the Viking age and create for themselves a reputation as fierce and pitiless warriors. Ad That image was magnified by those who wrote about the Viking attacks   in other words, their victims. The Anglo-Saxon cleric Alcuin of York wrote dramatically of the Lindisfarne raid that the  church was spattered with the blood of the priests of God, despoiled of all its ornaments  given as a prey to pagan peoples  and subsequent (mainly Christian) writers and chroniclers lost few opportunities to demonise the (mainly pagan) Vikings. Vikings: Valhalla   the real history behind Netflix's successor to Vikings Netflix's Vikings: Valhalla brings a new generation of Viking schemers and dreamers to the screen, from explorers Leif Erikson and Freyd s Eir ksd ttir to warrior Harald Sigurdsson and empire-builder King Cnut. Here s what s what to expect from the show, plus the real history that underpins the story Yet, though they undeniably carried out very destructive and violent attacks, from small-scale raids against churches to major campaigns involving thousands of warriors, the Vikings formed part of a complex and often sophisticated Scandinavian culture. As well as raiders they were traders, reaching as far east as the rivers of Russia and the Caspian Sea; explorers, sending ships far across the Atlantic to land on the coastline of North America five centuries before Columbus; poets, composing verse and prose sagas of great power, and artists, creating works of astonishing beauty. The reputation of the Vikings simply as raiders and plunderers has long been established. Restoring their fame as traders, storytellers, explorers, missionaries, artists and rulers is long overdue... When and where did the Vikings come from? The Vikings originated in what is now Denmark, Norway and Sweden (although centuries before they became unified countries). Their homeland was overwhelmingly rural, with almost no towns. The vast majority earned a meagre living through agriculture, or along the coast, by fishing. Advances in shipping technology in the 7th and 8th centuries meant that boats were powered by sails rather than solely by oars. These were then added to vessels made of overlapping planks ( clinker-built ) to create longships, swift shallow-drafted boats that could navigate coastal and inland waters and land on beaches. Exactly what first compelled bands of men to follow their local chieftain across the North Sea in these longships is unclear. It may have been localised overpopulation, as plots became subdivided to the point where families could barely eke out a living; it may have been political instability, as chieftains fought for dominance; or it may have been news brought home by merchants of the riches to be found in trading settlements further west. Probably it was a combination of all three. But in 793 that first raiding party hit Lindisfarne and within a few years further Viking bands had struck Scotland (794), Ireland (795) and France (799). Their victims did not refer to them as Vikings. That name came later, becoming popularised by the 11th century and possibly deriving from the word vik, which in the Old Norse language the Vikings spoke means  bay  or  inlet . Instead they were called Dani ( Danes )   there was no sense at the time that this should refer only to the inhabitants of what we now call Denmark   pagani ( pagans ) or simply Normanni ( Northmen ). The remains of a Viking longship found at Gokstad in South Norway, c1920. (Photo by Rischgitz/Getty Images) When and where did the Viking begin to raid? At first the raids were small-scale affairs, a matter of a few boatloads of men who would return home once they had collected sufficient plunder or if the resistance they encountered was too strong. But in the 850s they began to overwinter in southern England, in Ireland and along the Seine in France, establishing bases from which they began to dominate inland areas. The raids reached a crescendo in the second half of the ninth century. In Ireland the Vikings established longphorts   fortified ports   including at Dublin, from which they dominated much of the eastern part of the island. In France they grew in strength as a divided Frankish kingdom fractured politically and in 885 a Viking army besieged and almost captured Paris. In Scotland they established an earldom in the Orkneys and overran the Shetlands and the Hebrides. And in England an enormous Viking host, the micel here ( great army ) arrived in 865. Led by a pair of warrior brothers, Halfdan and Ivar the Boneless, they picked off the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England one by one. First Northumbria, with its capital at York, fell to them in 866, then East Anglia, followed by the central English kingdom of Mercia. Finally, only Wessex, ruled by King Alfred, remained. A pious bookworm, Alfred had only become king because his three more martial older brothers had sickened or died in battle in previous Viking invasions. Listen | Thomas Williams explores the key events and legacies of the Viking era In early January 878 a section of the Great Army led by Guthrum crossed the frontier and caught Alfred by surprise at the royal estate at Chippenham. Alfred barely managed to escape and spent months skulking in the Somerset marshes at Athelney. It looked like the independence of Wessex   and that of England generally   might be at an end. But against the odds Alfred gathered a new army, defeated the Vikings at Edington and forced Guthrum to accept baptism as a Christian. For his achievement in saving his kingdom he became the only native English ruler to gain the nickname  the Great . Silver penny of King Alfred.

Viking kings ruled this region until the last of them, Erik Bloodaxe, was expelled and killed in 954 and the kings of Wessex became rulers of a united England. Even so, Viking (and especially Danish) customs long persisted there and traces of Scandinavian DNA can still be found in a region that for centuries was known as the Danelaw. By the mid-11th century united kingdoms had appeared in Denmark, Norway and Sweden and the raids had finally begun to subside. There was a final burst of activity in the early 11th century when royal- expeditions succeeded in conquering England again and placing Danish kings on the throne there (including, most notably, Canute, who ruled an empire in England, Denmark and Norway, but who almost certainly did not command the tide to go out, as a folk tale alleges). Vikings remained in control of large parts of Scotland (especially Orkney), an area around Dublin and Normandy in France (where in 911 King Charles the Simple had granted land to a Norwegian chieftain, Rollo, the ancestor of William the Conqueror). They also controlled a large part of modern Ukraine and Russia, where Swedish Vikings had penetrated in the ninth century and established states based around Novgorod and Kiev. Where did Vikings settle and live? This was not the full extent of the Viking world, however. The same maritime aggression that had caused them to plunder (and ultimately conquer) settled lands also led them to venture in search of unknown shores on which to settle. Vikings probably arrived in the Faroes in the eighth century and they used this as a stepping-stone to sail further west across the Atlantic. In the mid-ninth century a series of Viking voyages came across Iceland and in the year 872 colonists led by Ing lf Arnarson settled on the island. They established a unique society, fiercely independent and owing no formal allegiance to the kings of Norway. It was a republic whose supreme governing body was, from 930, the Althing, an assembly made up of Iceland s chief men which met each summer in a plain beside a massive cleft in a ring of hills in the centre of the island. It has a strong claim to be the world s oldest parliament. From Iceland, too, we have other vital pieces of evidence of the inventiveness of Viking societies. These include the earliest pieces of history written by Vikings themselves in the form of a 12th-century history of Iceland, the  slendingab k, and the Landn mab k, an account of the original settlement of the island (with the names of each of the first settlers and the land they took). But more important   and surprising for those who view of the Vikings is as one-dimensional warriors   is the collection of sagas known as the  slendingas gur or Icelandic Family Sagas. Their setting is the first 150 years of the Viking colony in Iceland and they tell of often-troubled relations between the main Icelandic families. Alliances, betrayals, feuds and murders play out against the backdrop of a landscape in which features can still often be identified today. At their best, in tales such as Nj l s Saga or Egil s Saga, they are powerful pieces of literature in their own right, and among the most important writing to survive from any European country in the Middle Ages. Who was the most famous Viking? Ivarr the Boneless   a famous warrior and one of the leaders of the  Great Heathen Army  that landed in East Anglia in 865, and that went on to conquer the kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia   was remembered as the founding father of the royal dynasty of the Viking kingdom of Dublin. It is not known how Ivar came by the nickname  the Boneless , although some have suggested it could have been due to an unnatural flexibility during combat or because he suffered from a degenerative muscular disorder, eventually resulting in him having to be carried everywhere. Unless his body is ever recovered   which would be difficult if he really was  boneless    we will never know. Other famous Vikings include Aud the Deep-Minded, Eirik Bloodaxe and Einar Buttered-Bread. Click here to read about the 8 most famous Vikings Vikings and religion: what gods did they believe in? Iceland was the location of another drama that highlights the transition of Viking societies away from warrior chieftainships. Christianity came later to Scandinavian Viking societies than to many other parts of Europe. Whereas France s kings had accepted Christianity by the early sixth century and the Anglo-Saxon kings of England largely in the seventh, Christian missionaries only appeared in southern Scandinavia in the ninth century and made little headway there until Harald Bluetooth of Denmark accepted baptism in around 960. Harald had become Christian after a typical piece of Viking theatre: a drunken argument around the feasting table as to which was more powerful   Norse gods Odin and Thor, or the new Christian God and his son, Jesus. Iceland remained resolutely pagan, loyal to old gods such as Odin; the All Father; a one-eyed god who had sacrificed the other eye in exchange for knowledge of runes; and Thor, the thunder-god with his great hammer Mj lnir, who was also especially popular with warriors.

(Photo By DEA/G DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini/Getty Images) Iceland became Christian to avoid a civil war. Competing pagan and Christian factions threatened to tear the Althing apart and dissolve Iceland into separate, religiously hostile, states. At the Althing s meeting in the year 1000 the rival factions appealed to Iceland s most important official, the lawspeaker Thorgeir Thorkelsson. As a pagan he might have been expected to favour the old gods but, after an entire day spent agonising over the decision, he concluded that henceforth all Icelanders would be Christian. A few exceptions were made   for example the eating of horsemeat, a favoured delicacy that was also associated with pagan sacrifices, was to be permitted. Listen | Acclaimed screenwriter and producer Michael Hirst talks about his work on Vikings and the secrets of making great history drama What was Valhalla and how did Vikings get there? For a Viking, what two things would be desired the most in the afterlife of Valhalla, the hall of slain warriors? Feasting and fighting, of course. If chosen to die by the mythical Valkyries, a Norse warrior longed to be welcomed by the god Odin into Valhalla, a magnificent hall with a roof thatched with golden shields, spears for rafters, and so large that 540 doors lined its walls, says BBC History Revealed magazine. The honoured dead, known as the Einherjar, spent all day honing their battle skills against each other in preparation for Ragnar k   the end of the world   then every night, their wounds magically healed and they partied like only Vikings could. Their drinking horns never emptied thanks to Heidrun, a goat on the roof of Valhalla that ate from a special tree and produced the finest mead, and there was always enough meat as the boar named S hr mnir came back to life after each slaughter so it could be cooked over and over. To join the Einherjar, a Viking had to die in battle   and even then, they only had a 50:50 chance. The half not chosen to go to Valhalla instead went to the field of the goddess Freya, so they could offer to the women who died as maidens their company. As for the old or sick, they went to an underworld called Hel. It was largely not as bad as the name suggests, though there was a special place of misery reserved for murderers, adulterers and oath-breakers, where a giant dragon chewed on their corpses. Where did the Vikings travel to? Iceland, too, was the platform from which the Vikings launched their furthest-flung explorations. In 982 a fiery tempered chieftain, Erik the Red, who had already been exiled from Norway for his father s part in a homicide, was then exiled from Iceland for involvement in another murder. He had heard rumours of land to the west and, with a small group of companions, sailed in search of it. What he found was beyond his wildest imaginings. Only 300 kilometres west of Iceland, Greenland is the world s largest island, and its south and south-west tip had fjords [deep, narrow and elongated sea or lakedrain, with steep land on three sides] and lush pastures that must have reminded Erik of his Scandinavian homeland. He returned back to Iceland, gathered 25 ship-loads of settlers and established a new Viking colony in Greenland that survived into the 15th century. Erik s son, Leif, outdid his father. Having heard from another Viking Greenlander, Bjarni Herjolfsson, that he had sighted land even further west, Leif went to see for himself. In around 1002 he and his crew found themselves sailing somewhere along the coast of North America. They found a glacial, mountainous coast, then a wooded one, and finally a country of fertile pastures that they named Vinland. Although they resolved to start a new colony there, it was   unlike either Iceland or Greenland   already settled and hostility from native Americans and their own small numbers (Greenland at the time probably had about 3,000 Viking inhabitants) meant that it was soon abandoned. They had, though, become the first Europeans to land in (and settle in) the Americas, almost five centuries before Christopher Columbus. For centuries Erik s achievement lived on only in a pair of sagas, The Saga of the Greenlanders and Erik the Red s Saga. The location of Vinland, despite attempts to work out where it lay from information contained in the sagas, remained elusive. It was even unclear if the Vikings really had reached North America. Then, in the early 1960s, a Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his archaeologist wife, Anne Stine, found the remains of ancient houses at L Anse aux Meadows on Newfoundland in Canada. Fragments of worked iron (many of them nails, probably from a ship), which the native population did not possess the technology to produce, meant that it was soon clear this was a Viking settlement. Although perhaps too small to be the main Vinland colony, it was still astonishing confirmation of what the sagas had said. Leif Erikson s reputation as a great explorer and discoverer of new lands was confirmed without doubt. Who discovered America? It wasn't Christopher Columbus... This might well have pleased him, for a man s reputation was everything to a Viking. Quick wit, bravery and action were among the key attributes for a Viking warrior, but to be remembered for great deeds was the most important of all. The H vam l, a collection of Viking aphorisms, contains much apt advice such as  Never let a bad man know your own bad fortune , but most famous of all is the saying  Cattle die, kindred die, we ourselves shall die, but I know one thing that never dies: the reputations of each one dead . Did Viking shield-maidens exist? Apologies to fans of the hit series Vikings: historians just can t agree on whether Norse warrior women like Lagertha actually existed, says BBC History Revealed magazine. While there are stories of shield-maidens, or skjaldmaer, in historical accounts, nearly all can be dismissed as unreliable, apocryphal, allegorical or more myth than reality. Still, tantalising clues and mysterious finds   including artefacts showing women carrying swords, spears and shields   have boosted the idea that Viking women went into battle alongside men. In the 12th century, the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus wrote of women in Denmark who sought  so zealously to be skilled in warfare that they might have been thought to have unsexed themselves . In 2017, meanwhile, archaeologists discovered that a 10th-century grave of a warrior, filled with weapons, actually belonged to a woman. What was a Viking sunstone? The Vikings were superb sailors who got as far afield as Russia and North America, but their navigational techniques haven t always been completely understood, says BBC History Revealed magazine. A mysterious  sunstone , mentioned in a medieval Icelandic saga, was considered mere legend until an opaque crystal, made from Iceland spar, was recently discovered among the navigation equipment of a sunken Tudor shipwreck. Intriguingly, scientists have proven that Iceland spar, when held up to the sky, forms a solar compass that indicates the Sun s location, through concentric rings of polarised light, even in thick cloud cover or after dusk. It s now thought that this was the mysterious sunstone that helped guide Vikings such as  Lucky  Leif Erikson to Newfoundland, and usage of it may have persisted until the end of the 16th century. When did the Viking Age end? It is traditionally said that the raiding, pillaging age of the Vikings, which began in Britain with the ransacking of Lindisfarne in AD 793, ended with the failure of Harald Hardrada s invasion in 1066. Yet the Viking influence spread from the Middle East to North America, and could not be undone by a single defeat in battle. At the same time that Hardrada was picking up his career-ending neck injury at Stamford Bridge, the Norman Conquest was being launched. Its leader, and future king of England, was William   the great-great-great-grandson of Rollo, a Viking. Philip Parker is author of The Northmen s Fury: A History of the Viking World (Vintage, 2015).

        "target_summary": "A wave of terror descended upon Northumbria in 793, as armed raiders known as Vikings – seaborne Norsemen from Scandinavia – brutally attacked the defenceless monastery of Lindisfarne. This initial act of plunder and capture etched a fearsome reputation into history, heavily amplified by the Christian chroniclers who chronicled their devastating raids across north-western Europe for over two centuries, portraying them as pitiless warriors.\n\nYet, this one-dimensional image belies a far more intricate and sophisticated culture. Far from being mere plunderers, the Vikings were intrepid explorers who reached North America five centuries before Columbus, extensive traders whose routes stretched from Russia to the Caspian Sea, profound poets crafting powerful sagas, and skilled artists creating works of astonishing beauty. Hailing from the rural landscapes of what is now Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, their advanced longships, powered by sails and designed for shallow waters, allowed them to traverse vast distances, likely driven by localized overpopulation, political strife, or the allure of distant riches.\n\nTheir early, small-scale raids soon escalated into major campaigns. By the mid-9th century, they established overwintering bases, eventually forming fortified ports like Dublin, besieging Paris, and overrunning parts of Scotland. In England, the formidable \"Great Army\" conquered numerous Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, leaving only Wessex, which was heroically saved by King Alfred the Great. Alfred later established the Danelaw, a region under Viking rule until 954, where Scandinavian customs and even DNA left an enduring mark.\n\nBeyond conquest, their maritime prowess propelled them westward. Vikings settled Iceland, forming a fiercely independent republic with the world's oldest parliament, the Althing. From there, the fiery-tempered Erik the Red founded a colony in Greenland, and his son Leif Erikson became the first European to land in North America, establishing a temporary settlement in Vinland, a discovery unequivocally confirmed by modern archaeology. Their rich cultural legacy includes the invaluable Icelandic sagas, offering deep insights into their societal values where reputation, bravery, and wit were paramount.\n\nViking spiritual life was rooted in a vibrant paganism, honoring gods like Odin and Thor, with warriors aspiring to the feasting and fighting in Valhalla after a glorious death. However, their societies gradually transitioned to Christianity, exemplified by Iceland's peaceful, democratic conversion in 1000 AD. Their sophisticated navigation, potentially aided by 'sunstones' like Iceland spar, underpinned their widespread travels.\n\nWhile the traditional end of the Viking Age is often marked by Harald Hardrada's defeat in 1066, their enduring influence resonated across Europe. Descendants like William the Conqueror, tracing his lineage to a Norwegian chieftain, would dramatically reshape England, ensuring the Viking legacy was woven into the very fabric of medieval history, far transcending their initial violent renown.",

        "title": "Why did the Vikings' violent raids begin?",
        "content": "On a clear day, a Viking longship at sea could be seen some 18 nautical miles away. With a favourable wind, that distance could be covered in about an hour   which was perhaps all the time that the monks at Lindisfarne had to prepare themselves against attack on one fateful day in 793. This was the raid that signalled the start of the violence associated with the onset of the Viking age. Ad  We and our fathers have now lived in this fair land for nearly 350 years, and never before has such an atrocity been seen in Britain as we have now suffered at the hands of a pagan people. Such a voyage was not thought possible. The church of Saint Cuthbert is spattered with the blood of the priests of God, stripped of all its furnishings, exposed to the plundering of pagans   a place more sacred than any in Britain.  The extract is from a letter, written in the wake of the attack, to King  thelred of Northumbria by Alcuin. Alcuin had been a monk in York before accepting an invitation in 781 to join Charlemagne at his court in Aachen, where he became the Frankish king s leading spiritual advisor. Historians have been inclined to take Alcuin s astonishment at the raid at face value, and supposed the Vikings to be a wholly unknown quantity. Yet in the same letter Alcuin rebuked  thelred and his courtiers for aping the fashions of the heathens:  Consider the luxurious dress, hair and behaviour of leaders and people,  he urged the king.  See how you have wanted to copy the pagan way of cutting hair and beards. Are not these the people whose terror threatens us, yet you want to copy their hair?  The obvious conclusion is that, at the time of the raid, the Northumbrians were already familiar with their Norwegian visitors. What was new was the violence. Vikings Season 6 arrives on Amazon Prime on 30 December: catch up on what s happened so far Lindisfarne turned out to be the start of a wave of similar attacks on monasteries in northern Britain. Alcuin, with his local knowledge, warned the religious communities at nearby Wearmouth and Jarrow to be on their guard:  You live by the sea from whence this plague first came.  In 794, Vikings  ravaged in Northumbria, and plundered Ecgfrith s monastery at Donemuthan . The 12th century historian Symeon of Durham identified this as the monastery at Jarrow, and reported that its protector, Saint Cuthbert, had not let the heathens go unpunished,  for their chief was killed by the English  And these things befell them rightly, for they had gravely injured those who had not injured them.  Shetland and Orkney were probably overrun during this first wave of violence, and the indigenous population of Picts wiped out so swiftly that local place names and the names of natural phenomena such as rivers and mountains vanished, to be replaced by Scandinavian names. Ireland and the Western Isles of Scotland suffered, too. The Annals of Ulster report the burning in 795 of the monastery at Rechru, and the Isle of Skye  overwhelmed and laid waste . Iona was attacked for a first time in 795 and again in 802. In a third raid in 806 the monastery was torched and the community of 68 wiped out. Work started the following year on a safe refuge for the revived community at Kells in Ireland. In 799 the island monastery of Noirmoutier off the north-west coast of France was attacked for the first time. By 836 it had been raided so often that its monks also abandoned the site and sought refuge in a safer location. It soon become clear, however, that there was no such thing as a safe refuge. Best form of defence Why was there such hatred in the attacks, and why did they start in 793, rather than 743, or 843? To look for a triggering event we need to examine the political situation in northern Europe at the time. At the commencement of the Viking age, the major political powers in the world were Byzantium in the east; the Muslims, whose expansion had taken them as far as Turkistan and Asia Minor to create an Islamic barrier between the northern and southern hemispheres; and the Franks, who had become the dominant tribe among the successor states after the fall of the Roman empire in the west. Charlemagne became sole ruler of the Franks in 771. He took seriously the missionary obligations imposed on him by his position as the most powerful ruler in western Christendom, and expended a huge amount of energy on the subjugation of the heathen Saxons on his north-east border. In 772, his forces crossed into Saxon territory and destroyed Irminsul, the sacred tree that was their most holy totem. In 779, Widukind, the Saxon leader, was defeated in battle at Bocholt and Saxony taken over and divided into missionary districts. Charlemagne himself presided over a number of mass baptisms. In 782, his armies forcibly baptised and then executed 4,500 Saxon captives at Verden, on the banks of the river Aller. Campaigns of enforced resettlement followed, but resistance continued until a final insurrection was put down in 804. By this time Charlemagne had already been rewarded for his missionary activities by Pope Leo III who in Rome in AD 800 crowned him imperator   emperor not of a geographical area nor even of a collection of peoples but of the abstract conception of Christendom as a single community. With their physical subjugation complete, the cultural subjugation of the Saxons followed. Death was the penalty for eating meat during Lent; death for cremating the dead in accordance with heathen rites; death for rejecting baptism. Several times, in the course of the campaign of resistance, Widukind sought refuge across the border with his brother-in-law Sigfrid, a Danish king. News of Charlemagne s depredations, and in particular the Verden massacre, must have travelled like a shock wave through Danish territory and beyond. How should the heathen Scandinavians react to the threat? For, whether they knew it or not, they were on Alcuin s list of peoples to be converted. In 789 he wrote to a friend working among the Saxons:  Tell me, is there any hope of our converting the Danes?  The question for the Vikings was: should they simply wait for Charlemagne s armies to arrive and set about the task? Or should they fight to defend their culture? A military campaign against the might of Frankish Christendom was out of the question. However, the Christian monasteries   such as Lindisfarne   dotted around the rim of northern Europe were symbolically important and, in the parlance of modern terrorist warfare,  soft targets . So, with an indifference to the humanity of their victims as complete as that of Charlemagne s towards the Saxons, these first Viking raiders were able to set off on a punishing series of attacks in the grip of a no-holds-barred rage directed at Christian  others . The Christian annalists who documented Viking violence insistently saw the conflict as a battle between religious cultures. A century after the first attack on Lindisfarne, Asser, in his biography of Alfred the Great, continued to refer to the much larger bands of Vikings who had by now established thdaemselves along the eastern seaboard of England as  the pagans  (pagani), and to their victims as  Christians  (christiani). Clash of faiths Attacks such as those mounted by Vikings were almost impossible to defend against, and long before Asser s time the raiders had discovered how easy it was to plunder what was probably the richest country in western Europe. In 851 a fleet of 350 ships sailed up the Thames to attack London and Canterbury then, instead of sailing home, spent the winter encamped at Thanet. It was a prelude to the arrival in 865 of what the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle called the  Great Heathen Army    a force that, after 15 years of warring against the demoralised kingdoms of Northumbria, Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia, had gained control of England from York down to East Anglia. By 927 much of the lost territory had been regained by the Wessex king Alfred the Great, his son Edward and grandson  thelstan, but by that time the achievements of the Great Heathen Army had became part of the cultural history of young Viking males. Large-scale Viking violence returned to England during the reign of King  thelred in the 990s, under the Dane, Swein Forkbeard, and the Norwegian, Olaf Tryggvason. The policy of the  danegeld    protection money paid in return for being left alone   was practised with a punishing regularity. It was with wealth gained in this fashion that the Viking Olaf Tryggvason financed his successful bid for the crown of Norway in 995. In 1012 the archbishop of Canterbury was captured and, when the ransom demanded for him was not forthcoming, was murdered for the sport of a drunken group of men under the Viking earl Thorkell the Tall. They pelted him with bones, stones, blocks of wood and the skulls of cattle before finishing him off with the flat of an axe. The loss of its spiritual head brought the faltering Anglo-Saxon monarchy to its knees, and within two years a Danish king, Swein Forkbeard, was on the throne of England. By 1028 Swein s son Cnut was ruler of a North Sea empire that included Denmark (with Sk ne in Sweden), Norway, and all England. In name, at least, the heathens were now Christians but their pride in themselves as conquering warriors remained strong. A poem in praise of Cnut   composed by his Icelandic court poet, Sigvat   invoked the memory of the Northumbrian king  lla of York, defeated in battle by Ivar the Boneless during the first surge of the Great Heathen Army:  And Ivar, who dwelt in York, carved the eagle on  lla s back.  Remarkably, Cnut s triumphs figured in Sigvat s literary imagination as the successful resolution of a conflict that had been going on for over 150 years, beginning as a series of gestures of cultural self-defence and soon after developing into dreams of conquest. Alcuin had foreseen the ultimate consequences of the first Viking raid of 793 with visionary precision.  Who does not fear this?  he asked King  thelred of Northumbria.  Who does not lament this as if his country were captured?  In his distress, he was overlooking the fact that the Vikings were only doing what his own Saxon forefathers had done to the Britons and Celts of the kingdoms of England some three and a half centuries earlier, conquering  this fair land  by the same means   violence   as the Vikings. Cnut was unlucky with his sons, and Danish rule in England lasted less than 30 years. Fifteen years on and the memories of King Cnut and his North Sea empire were all but wiped out by the greater drama of Duke William of Normandy s conquest of 1066. Robert Ferguson has been a leading scholar and exponent of Scandinavian culture and history for over 30 years. He lives in Oslo and on the Isle of Cumbrae. Three other explanations for Viking violence Faster ships, internal strife and new trade links may also have helped trigger the raids Technological advances that encouraged piracy The onset of the Viking age coincided with the appearance of the technologically advanced, sail-powered longship   the stealth bomber of its time. Longships such as the Oseberg ship (built 820) replaced giant man-powered vessels like the Storhaug ship, found on Karm y (buried 779), opening up the seas to young Scandinavian pirates as never before. Poverty and overpopulation In his history On the Customs and Deeds of the First Norman Dukes (995 1015), Dudo of Saint-Quentin wrote that, in former times in the Scandinavian homelands, quarrels over land and property were resolved by  the drawing of lots . Losers were condemned to a life abroad where  by fighting they can gain themselves countries . A flood of riches into Scandinavia Trading led to an influx of silver bullion into Scandinavia from the Islamic world, creating elites around which ambitious young men gathered. Leaders had to reward these men for their military support and loyalty, and did so by plundering abroad on the grand scale. The etymology of the word  Viking  It is not even certain that  Viking  is Scandinavian in origin. It occurs several times in the Old English poems Widsith, usually dated to the end of the seventh century, and in the eighth-century Exodus, in which the tribe of Reuben are described as  s wicingas , meaning  sea-warriors , as they cross the Red Sea on their way out of Egypt. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle uses the term only four times before 1066, in the native English forms w cenga or w cinga, in 879, 885, 921 and 982. Some linguists believe it derives from the Latin v cus, meaning  camp  or  dwelling-place . Others suggest it comes from an Old Norse verb v kja, meaning  to travel from place to place . A simple and persuasive theory is that it originally denoted people from the Vik, the name for the bay area of south-east Norway around the Oslo fjord that also denoted the inland coastal region, and included the coast of Bohusl n in present-day Sweden. There is support for the suggestion in the frequency with which the waters of the Vik appear in saga literature, suggesting it was the most heavily trafficked maritime area in the region at the time.

        "target_summary": "The ominous appearance of a Viking longship across 18 nautical miles of sea provided little more than an hour's warning for the monks of Lindisfarne on that fateful day in 793. This brutal assault, vividly recounted by Alcuin to King Æthelred, marked the violent dawn of the Viking Age. Alcuin’s letter, lamenting the desecration of Saint Cuthbert's sacred church and the unthinkable savagery, initially suggests utter surprise. Yet, his concurrent scolding of Northumbrian nobles for mimicking \"heathen\" fashions implies a prior familiarity, revealing that it was not the Vikings themselves, but their terrifying *violence*, that was profoundly new.\n\nLindisfarne proved to be the harbinger of a devastating wave, as Viking attacks rapidly spread to monasteries across northern Britain, Ireland, and beyond, from Wearmouth and Jarrow to the remote Western Isles, Iona, and even Noirmoutier off France. These wealthy, undefended religious outposts, scattered along the coasts, became irresistible \"soft targets.\" The ferocity of these raids was such that entire populations, like the Picts of Shetland and Orkney, were swiftly eradicated, their ancient place names replaced by Scandinavian ones, as communities desperately sought, and rarely found, safe havens.\n\nThe intense animosity of these early Viking raids is best understood by examining the political climate of northern Europe. Charlemagne, the powerful Frankish ruler, was aggressively expanding Christendom, brutally subjugating the pagan Saxons on his borders. His campaigns involved the destruction of sacred sites like Irminsul, forced baptisms, and the horrific massacre of 4,500 Saxons at Verden. These acts, and the imposition of Christian law with death penalties for pagan practices, sent shockwaves through Scandinavian lands, whose people were next on Charlemagne's conversion list. Unable to confront the mighty Frankish empire directly, the \"heathen\" Scandinavians, perhaps in a defensive rage against encroaching Christian conversion, turned their fury upon the vulnerable, wealthy Christian monasteries across northern Europe. These symbolically significant \"soft targets\" provided an outlet for a violent backlash, transforming the conflict into a perceived clash of religious cultures.\n\nThe initial raids soon escalated into full-scale invasions, as Vikings discovered the immense plunder potential of England. The \"Great Heathen Army\" of 865, after years of relentless warfare, carved out a vast territory from Northumbria to East Anglia, etching Viking conquest into their cultural lore. Though Alfred the Great and his descendants reclaimed much of this land, large-scale violence resurfaced in the 990s under leaders like Swein Forkbeard. The infamous \"danegeld\" became a regular payment, yet couldn't prevent atrocities like the brutal murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Ultimately, this led to the establishment of a Danish monarchy in England, culminating in Cnut's formidable North Sea empire by 1028. Even as these 'heathens' nominally converted to Christianity, their identity as conquering warriors remained potent, celebrated in sagas as the resolution of a long conflict. Alcuin's early fears of total capture proved prescient, ironically mirroring the very conquests Anglo-Saxon ancestors had inflicted centuries before. Danish rule, however, was fleeting, eventually overshadowed by the Norman Conquest of 1066.\n\nBeyond this religious and political impetus, other factors also fueled the Viking Age. Technological advancements like the swift, sail-powered longship revolutionized seafaring piracy. Overpopulation and internal land disputes in Scandinavia may have driven many to seek fortunes abroad. Furthermore, a new influx of Islamic silver bullion from trade created wealthy elites who rewarded loyal warriors through grand-scale overseas plunder, transforming desperate raids into a strategic means of power and wealth.",

        "title": "Forget the longships: this is the overlooked story of how the Vikings dominated eastern Europe",
        "content": "The Norse peoples of the Viking Age held much of western Europe tightly in their grip thanks to their imperious command of the sea. Ad Their prowess as seafarers let them strike their targets at speed and then slip away just as swiftly, in repeated cycles of relentless raids from the fertile shores of the British Isles to the harsher coasts of Iceland that brought wealth and power. Viking longships carved with fearsome, dragon-headed prows crashed through imposing waves, delivering warriors to burn monasteries and terrorise prosperous lands. These vessels were key to their hit-and-run strategy, and to its eventual evolution into something more settled as the Norse forged enduring strongholds on hostile ground. But for the Vikings who ventured east toward the Slavic and Baltic regions, the story unfolded very differently. Conquests there weren t defined by ocean raids, but by a remarkable capacity for canny adaptation. In the territories of today s Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, the Norse traded the open sea for winding rivers, turning inland waterways into vital thoroughfares of commerce, conflict and state-building.  The rivers are absolutely critical,  explains historian Martyn Whittock, author of Vikings in the East, speaking on the HistoryExtra podcast.  We need to envisage them as the motorways of the early medieval world, which allow people access deep into the heart of the European continent, particularly the east.  When did the Vikings first head east? Archaeological finds from the mid-eighth century (including Scandinavian-style burials in places like Staraya Ladoga, near modern St Petersburg) show that the Norse were already present on the Baltic-Russian frontier before the famous raids on Britain had even begun. These early Norse pioneers were traders as well as warriors. They followed the Neva and Volkhov rivers into the interior, establishing bases like Ladoga and Novgorod. From there, they probed deeper, carrying boats and their cargo overland between river systems.  | Norse gods and goddesses: 14 of the most important deities venerated by the Vikings By the ninth century, Norse settlers were establishing footholds from which they could push further inland.  We first see Norse settlements appear in eastern Europe along the southern shores of the Baltic,  says Whittock.  Increasingly they were utilising river systems which flow into the Baltic, and by following them along their courses into what is now northwestern Russia, they could then port ships across gaps in the river systems to connect with other river systems.  Swapping longships for log boats While the famous longships were ideal for crossing seas, they were less suited to being hauled over rapids or dragging across portages. So, in the east, Vikings turned to different vessels.  To start with, we should be thinking of squatter, stronger and broader trading vessels than the dragon-prowed ships of popular imagination,  says Whittock. The Norse also adopted local craft. Archaeological evidence shows they purchased huge unfinished log boats from Finnic and Slavic neighbours, later fitting them with sails. These sturdy ships could handle rapids and were easier to portage than larger ships.  | The dark reality of Norse life on the edge And in winter, transport shifted to sledges, which were ideal for gliding across frozen rivers and snowbound plains.  We need to think of sledges, because we always think of summer transport,  says Whittock.  And yet in many of these areas, winter transport on frozen rivers or frozen, snowy landscapes would be on sledges. That's the kind of mental image we need to have: more of a mixed economy of transport.  By log boat or sledge, the Norse moved steadily southwards through modern-day Russia, past today s Smolensk, into Ukraine, and eventually to Kyiv. That city became the hub of a new and lasting regional power: Kievan Rus, the central hub of the Rus Vikings. This 8th-century runestone depicts a Viking longship   a powerful symbol of Norse identity, seafaring prowess, and the raiding and trading voyages that shaped the Viking Age. (Photo by Getty Images) Who were the Rus, and where does the name come from? The name  Rus  itself may refer explicitly to this river-faring identity.  It s interesting that one of the possible word origins for the name  Rus  is from a mixed Finnish, old East Norse word, which means rowers: those who row,  Whittock explains. Before they were the inhabitants of Kievan Rus, they were Vikings of the kind introduced by Whittock, moving along rivers, rowing against currents and hauling boats across land. This eastward expansion would have been impossible without the rivers that stretched across the Eurasian plain like veins.  | The truth about Viking berserkers  Those rivers that flow north into the Baltic allowed access well into the heart of Russia. It was then possible to pick up other major river systems that then flow south into Ukraine and towards the Caspian Sea,  Whittock notes. A closer look at the geography of eastern Europe shows the river system that made this possible. The Dnieper linked Novgorod and Smolensk to the Black Sea and Constantinople. The Volga carried Norse merchants towards the Caspian, opening routes to Persia and the Islamic caliphates. These rivers made Scandinavia part of a global economy stretching to Byzantium, Baghdad and beyond. The rise of Rus The Rus settlements steadily grew into a federation of principalities ruled by Scandinavian dynasties but populated mainly by Slavs. Over generations, intermarriage and cultural exchange transformed the Norse elites. They adopted Slavic languages, Byzantine Christianity and local customs. By the late ninth century, leaders like Rurik (credited as founder of the Rus dynasty) and his successors, Oleg and Igor, were consolidating power in Novgorod and Kyiv, extracting tribute from Slavic tribes and expanding their authority through warfare and alliances. By the late 10th century, rulers like Vladimir the Great were more Slavic than Norse in culture, even if their lineage traced back to Scandinavia. The Norse had become the Rus: a distinct identity forged by geography and circumstance. Kyiv emerged as the heart of this world. Its location on the Dnieper made it a natural hub for trade flowing between Scandinavia, Byzantium and the steppe. From here, the rulers of Rus built a power that stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea. 1066: The battle for England Member exclusive | The year 1066 is the most famous in English history, but there's a lot more to the story than one bloody battle at Hastings.

In this four-part series, medievalist Marc Morris talks David Musgrove through the full story of the Norman Conquest. A distinct Viking identity: the Rus vs the Icelanders The Rus experience diverged sharply from that of Norse settlers in the west. In Iceland, Vikings recreated a Scandinavian society, carrying their laws, sagas and language with them across the North Atlantic. Isolation preserved their Norse culture in near-pure form.  | 10 incredible Viking stories from Norse mythology In eastern Europe, by contrast, the Vikings were absorbed into a much larger Slavic world. Over time, the Norse language faded, replaced by Old East Slavic. Pagan traditions gave way to Byzantine Orthodox Christianity. Norse sagas never took root; instead, the Rus produced chronicles and legal codes in Slavic style.  This began as a Norse Slavic state, but it increasingly became a Slavic state with Norse echoes. There was an awareness of origins and a real awareness of connectivity to the northern world, but by the year 1,000 this was an increasingly a Slavic state,  says Whittock. The Viking story in eastern Europe is one of adaptation and transformation. In the west, Norsemen dominated seas and coastlines. In the east, they turned rivers, frozen or flowing, into a tool of power. In the process, they stopped being only Norse. They became the Rus: a people who built a state undeniably distinct from their cousins in Iceland or Norway. Ad Martyn Whittock was speaking to James Osborne on the HistoryExtra podcast.

        "target_summary": "The Viking Age Norse are famously known for their imperious command of the sea, their dragon-headed longships delivering swift, relentless raids across Western Europe, from the British Isles to Iceland. This maritime prowess allowed them to establish formidable strongholds, cementing a legacy of conquest and power. However, a vastly different, equally compelling saga unfolded for the Vikings who ventured eastward into the Slavic and Baltic regions. Here, their conquests were not defined by oceanic raids but by an extraordinary capacity for canny adaptation to the continent's intricate river networks.\n\nThese winding rivers, described by historian Martyn Whittock as the \"motorways of the early medieval world,\" became vital thoroughfares for commerce, conflict, and state-building, granting access deep into Eastern Europe's heartland. Archaeological evidence indicates the Norse were present on the Baltic-Russian frontier from the mid-eighth century, predating their famous Western incursions. These early pioneers were astute traders as much as warriors, following rivers like the Neva and Volkhov inland to establish crucial bases such as Ladoga and Novgorod, meticulously portaging boats and cargo between interconnected river systems.\n\nRecognizing the limitations of their famous longships on rapids and portages, the Eastern Vikings ingeniously adapted their transport. They favored squatter, sturdier trading vessels and readily adopted local craft, purchasing unfinished log boats from Finnic and Slavic neighbors, which they then fitted with sails. In the harsh winters, transport seamlessly shifted to sledges, gliding effortlessly across frozen rivers and snowbound plains, demonstrating a pragmatic \"mixed economy of transport.\"\n\nThis strategic mobility allowed the Norse to steadily push south through modern-day Russia and Ukraine, culminating in the establishment of Kyiv as the vibrant hub of a new and enduring regional power: Kievan Rus. The very name \"Rus\" may eloquently derive from a mixed Finnish and Old East Norse word signifying \"rowers,\" underscoring their profound riverine identity. Crucial arteries like the Dnieper and Volga rivers linked Scandinavia to a vast global economy stretching from Byzantium and the Black Sea to Persia, the Caspian, and the Islamic caliphates.\n\nKievan Rus blossomed into a federation of principalities, initially ruled by Scandinavian dynasties but predominantly populated by Slavs. Over generations, a profound cultural exchange and intermarriage transformed the Norse elite. They embraced Slavic languages, adopted Byzantine Orthodox Christianity, and integrated local customs. By the late 10th century, leaders like Vladimir the Great embodied a culture far more Slavic than Norse, even as their lineage traced back to Scandinavia. The Norse had, through a remarkable process of adaptation and assimilation, become the Rus—a distinct people forged by their unique geography and circumstances.\n\nThis Eastern narrative sharply contrasts with Norse settlements like Iceland, where relative isolation preserved a pure Scandinavian culture, laws, and language. In the East, the Vikings were absorbed into a vast Slavic world, their language fading, their pagan traditions replaced, and their sagas giving way to Slavic chronicles. The Viking story in Eastern Europe is thus a powerful testament to adaptation and transformation, where fierce seafarers became astute river-farers, crafting a powerful state and a unique identity entirely separate from their Western cousins.",

        "content": "The raid on Lindisfarne On 8 June 793, the terrified inhabitants of the small Northumbrian island of Lindisfarne found themselves under attack. Norse longboats landed on the holy island with the intention of plundering its monastery's riches. Treasures were stolen, religious relics destroyed and monks murdered, in a brutal and shocking start to the Viking age and centuries of Viking activity in Britain. Ad Anglo-Saxon monasteries made rich pickings for Viking raiders. The British Isles  religious communities could offer little resistance to the plundering of their treasures. Furthermore, as pagans, the Viking attackers had no religious qualms about desecrating sacred sites. Lindisfarne was not the first time Scandinavians had visited on the British Isles. While they had largely come to trade peacefully, there had been sporadic violence. In 789 three ships of Norsemen had landed on the coast of the kingdom of Wessex and murdered one of the king s officials. Yet the merciless raid on Lindisfarne s monastery was different   it was an unprecedented brutal strike right at the heart of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. The shocking event spread fear and panic across Christian Europe. The scholar Alcuin argued that God, as vengeance on the immoral people of the kingdom of Northumbria, had sent the raiders. The attack was not easily forgotten. In the ninth century, Lindisfarne s Anglo-Saxon residents memorialised the violence by carving the scenes of bloodshed onto a stone grave marker. The stone, now kept in Lindisfarne s museum, is known as the  Viking Domesday Stone . Just as Christian communities had feared, Lindisfarne heralded the beginning of further death and destruction, as Viking raids on Britain escalated over the following years.

Up until this point, Scandinavian expeditions to the British Isles had consisted of smaller raiding parties on  smash-and-grab  missions. Their intention was to plunder the islands  riches before returning to their homelands with the loot. The Great Heathen Army was different however   it was a calculated invasion force. The army was a coalition consisting of soldiers from Norway and Denmark, and possibly also Sweden. According to legend, various bands of Norsemen came together under the leadership of the three sons of legendary Viking warlord Ragnar Lothrok   Halfdan Ragnarsson, Ivar the Boneless and Ubba. The number of troops in the army is unclear   estimates range from less than 1,000 men to several thousands. The Great Heathen Army landed on the coast of East Anglia in the autumn of 865, picking up horses before going on to capture Northumbria and York. For several years, frequent fighting plagued the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, as rulers proved unable to subdue the spread of the Viking invaders. By 874, Wessex was the only Anglo-Saxon kingdom not under effective Viking control. 866   York is conquered by Viking forces As a thriving Anglo-Saxon metropolis and prosperous economic hub, York was a clear target for the Vikings. Led by Ivar the Boneless and Halfdan, Scandinavian forces attacked the town on All Saints  Day. Launching the assault on a holy day proved an effective tactical move   most of York s leaders were in the cathedral, leaving the town vulnerable to attack and unprepared for battle. After it was conquered, the city was renamed from the Saxon Eoforwic to Jorvik. It became the capital of Viking territory in Britain, and at its peak boasted more than 10,000 inhabitants. This was a population second only to London within Great Britain. Jorvik proved an important economic and trade centre for the Vikings. Norse coinage was created at the Jorvik mint, while archaeologists have found evidence of a variety of craft workshops around the town s central Coppergate area. These demonstrate that textile production, metalwork, carving, glasswork and jewellery-making were all practised in Jorvik. Materials from as far afield as the Arabian gulf have also been discovered, suggesting that the town was part of an international trading network. According to Dr Soren Sindbaek, urban living in the tightly packed streets of Jorvik was unusual for Viking settlers, whose traditional lifestyle was agricultural. Sindbaek argues that for a Viking,  the commonest path is to farm the land  If you end up in towns, something s almost always gone wrong.  Jorvik's last Viking king was Eric Bloodaxe. Depicted in Norse sagas as a bloody tyrant, Bloodaxe was expelled from York in 954, after which the town returned to Anglo-Saxon rule. A silver penny minted in 10th-century Jorvik.

However, Viking forces had failed to conquer Wessex, under the rule of Alfred the Great. After two unsuccessful invasion attempts, in 878 the army launched a third attack on Alfred s kingdom. At the ensuing battle of Edington, they met with a crushing defeat at the hands of the Anglo-Saxons and Viking leader Guthrum met with Alfred to negotiate terms. A peace treaty was established. Guthrum agreed to baptism and assumed the Anglo-Saxon name Aethelstan. In return, Alfred formally recognised the Viking leader as king of East Anglia. As part of this peace treaty, a political boundary was drawn up, dividing Aethelstan s Norse territory in the north-east and Alfred s Anglo-Saxon lands in the south-west. The Viking region, known as the Danelaw, was to be dominated by Norse customs and law-codes, different to those of the surrounding Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The first article of the treaty formally drawn up between Alfred and Guthrum has been taken to mark out the boundaries of the Danelaw. It reads    First concerning our boundaries: up on the Thames, and then up on the Lea, and along the Lea unto its source, then straight to Bedford, then up on the Ouse to Watling Street.  The treaty also laid down laws to establish peaceful co-existence between the two kingdoms. Its fifth article banned attacks by raiding bands, set down rules for the exchange of hostages and slaves and made allowances for safe trading between Vikings and Anglo-Saxons. Listen | Acclaimed screenwriter and producer Michael Hirst talks about his work on Vikings and the secrets of making great history drama Although the Danelaw was never extensively settled by Vikings and had dissolved by c954, the impact of Norse rule on England s north-east was significant and long lasting. Echoes of the Danelaw could be traced forward in the social customs and law codes (such as severe fines for breach of the peace) of the region for many centuries. Norse influence can still be seen in the area s place names, especially in the central Viking hub of Yorkshire. Here, you can still find many town names ending in  thorpe , the Norse term for an outlying farmstead, and  by , which meant a farmstead or village.

(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) 10th century   The Second Viking Age In the mid-tenth century Denmark began to emerge as a major power, heralding in what is known as the Second Viking Age. As the Danish kingdom became increasingly powerful, Viking raiders began to target the British Isles with a renewed ferocity. In 991 Danish king Swein Forkbeard landed in Kent with more than 90 longboats, before exacting a cruel victory over Anglo-Saxon forces at the battle of Maldon. Over the following two decades, Swein led several more destructive campaigns in England. While Norse raids had been targeting the Britain Isles since the eighth century, it was unprecedented for these raids to be led by the king himself. Raids were on a larger scale than ever before, and Swein s Danish forces proved unstoppable as they ravaged England s major towns and extorted money from their leaders. By 1012, the Anglo-Saxons  situation had reached breaking point. Payments to the Danes, known as Danegeld, had proved crippling. Anglo-Saxon leaders were forced to raise 22,000kg of silver, largely levied through tax. The same year, Viking raiders led by Thorkell the Tall (it is debated whether Thorkell was an agent of Swein or not) plundered Canterbury and held the archbishop Aelfheah hostage for seven months. When he refused to let anyone pay his ransom they pelted him to death with bones and struck him over the head with an axe. c1000   The Vikings reach North America The British Isles were not the only destination of seafaring Norse traders, raiders and adventurers. Paris, Iceland, Italy and even the Iberian peninsula and Morocco were also visited by the Vikings. Remarkable archaeological discoveries have revealed that Norse longboats even travelled huge distances to North America, making the Vikings the first Europeans to land on the continent. In 1960, evidence of Norse settlement was uncovered at L Anse aux Meadows, a site on the northernmost tip of the island of Newfoundland, off the east coast of Canada. Who discovered America? It wasn't Christopher Columbus... Investigation into the site began after archaeologists found a small cloak pin that appeared to be of Scandinavian origin. Further archaeological work revealed timber-framed buildings identical to ones in Viking settlements discovered in Greenland and Iceland. After extensive work on the sites, experts have suggested that there were in fact Norse settlers in Newfoundland, but they stayed close to the coast and abandoned the site just a few years after it was founded. According to Norse sagas, the first Viking explorer to reach North America was Leif Erikson, a fearless seafaring adventurer who discovered  Vinland . The description of  Vinland  in the sagas has been seen by some to match the site in Newfoundland. In 2015, a potential new site of Viking settlement was found at Point Rosee, on Newfoundland s south-west coast. Identified using infrared satellite images and aerial photographs, the site contains promising evidence of iron-smelting, and turf walls which match Norse construction styles. Further investigation into the site is planned for later this year. Replicas Of Norse sod houses in L anse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland.

Although Swein had been campaigning in Britain from 991 onwards, fighting had been piecemeal. His troops were repeatedly forced back to Scandinavia   in 999 by an attempted coup in his homeland and in 1005 by famine in Britain. However, after decades of patchy campaigning, in 1013 Swein s attempts to conquer the entirety of Anglo-Saxon England finally came to fruition. By 1013, Oxford, Bath, Winchester and many other major towns had capitulated to Swein s forces. After fierce resistance, London also finally submitted, its residents afraid of what the Viking forces might inflict on them. Following these victories, the Anglo-Saxon king Aethelred the Unready was forced into exile in Normandy and Swein was finally accepted as king of England. However, after battling for so long to add England to his great Scandinavian empire, Swein s reign was short-lived. Only five weeks after he was pronounced king of England, Forkbeard died on 3 February 1014. It took two more years of intensive fighting before the country was returned to Viking rule, under Swein s son Cnut. King Cnut reigned over England for 19 years, finally bringing a period of relative peace and stability to the kingdom and uniting his Anglo-Saxon and Danish subjects. Listen | Thomas Williams explores the key events and legacies of the Viking era 1066   The end of the Viking age The death of Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor (of the House of Wessex) in 1066 led to a power-struggle for the English crown. The Viking contender for the throne was Harald Hardrada, king of Norway. Descended from the line of the kings of Norway ousted by Cnut a generation earlier, Hardrada claimed a right to the throne based on an agreement between his father and Hardicanute, Cnut's son and successor. In an effort to reclaim England for the Scandinavians, in 1066 Hardrada sailed to England with 300 ships stuffed full of 11,000 warriors. His intention was to seize the throne from the vulnerable Anglo-Saxon king Harold Godwinson, who was also expecting a Norman invasion from the south. After sailing up the river Ouse and seizing York, Hardrada s forces were taken by surprise by the Anglo-Saxon troops at Stamford Bridge. Harold Godwinson s men had travelled north with remarkable speed, meaning that the Scandinavian forces were unprepared to take them on. Not expecting Harold Godwinson to leave the south under the threat of Norman invasion, Hardrada had left both men and armour behind with his anchored fleet at Riccall. The Viking army was smashed and Hardrada killed by an arrow through the neck. It was reported that of the 300 longboats that landed in England, only 24 returned to their homeland carrying the survivors. Despite proving a failure, the Viking invasion of 1066 nonetheless had a significant impact on British history. Taking on the Vikings at Stamford Bridge had weakened Harold Godwinson s forces, making the path easier for the successful invasion of William of Normandy. William defeated Godwinson at the battle of Hastings just three weeks later, going on to launch a conquest more successful and long lasting than any Viking invasion. Hardrada s crushing defeat at Stamford Bridge is generally seen as the end of Viking influence in Britain. Centuries of raiding, extortion, trading and bloodshed had finally come to a close.

        "target_summary": "The Viking Age in Britain commenced with a chilling brutality in 793, as Norse longboats descended upon Lindisfarne. This \"holy island\" monastery was savagely plundered, its treasures stolen, sacred relics destroyed, and monks murdered in an unprecedented assault on Anglo-Saxon Christianity. This shocking event, memorialized on the \"Viking Domesday Stone,\" ignited centuries of escalating Norse activity, with wealthy, undefended monasteries proving irresistible targets for pagan raiders.\n\nBy 865, Viking ambitions solidified from sporadic raids into a calculated invasion with the arrival of the formidable Great Heathen Army. This formidable coalition, reportedly led by the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok, swept across England, conquering vast swathes of territory. A pivotal moment was the capture of York in 866. This thriving Anglo-Saxon metropolis, strategically seized on All Saints' Day, was dramatically transformed into Jorvik, the bustling capital of Viking Britain. Jorvik flourished as a significant economic and trade hub, renowned for its diverse crafts and international connections, an unusual urban center for the predominantly agricultural Norse settlers.\n\nDespite widespread conquests, the Vikings faced a formidable adversary in Alfred the Great of Wessex. Following a decisive defeat at Edington in 878, a peace treaty was forged, formally establishing the Danelaw in 886. This agreement delineated distinct Anglo-Saxon and Norse territories, with the Danelaw governed by Viking customs and law-codes. Though its political lifespan was limited, the Danelaw left an enduring cultural and linguistic legacy, still visible in place names across England's north-east.\n\nThe mid-tenth century heralded the Second Viking Age, marked by Denmark's emergence as a major power. Raids on Britain intensified with unprecedented ferocity, often spearheaded by King Swein Forkbeard himself. These destructive campaigns extorted crippling payments, known as Danegeld, from Anglo-Saxon leaders, and witnessed brutal acts such as the murder of Archbishop Aelfheah. Meanwhile, Viking seafaring prowess extended far beyond Britain, as evidenced by archaeological discoveries at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland around 1000 AD, confirming them as the first Europeans to reach North America.\n\nBy 1013, Swein Forkbeard's relentless efforts culminated in the conquest of England, forcing King Aethelred into exile and crowning Swein as the first Viking King of England, albeit briefly. His son, Cnut, subsequently secured the throne, ushering in a period of relative peace and stability by uniting Anglo-Saxon and Danish subjects under his rule.\n\nThe Viking Age in Britain concluded dramatically in 1066.

Hardrada's death and the near-annihilation of his fleet effectively ended centuries of Norse influence. Critically, this costly victory severely weakened Godwinson's forces, inadvertently paving the way for William of Normandy's successful invasion at Hastings just weeks later, thus drawing a final curtain on the era of Norse ambition in Britain.",

        "content": "Hitler has only got one ball, / Goring has two but very small, / Himmler is rather sim lar, / But poor old Goebbels has no balls at all.  Ad This cheeky wartime ditty mocking the masculinity of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi leadership, set to the jaunty tune of the Coloney Bogey March, was once a familiar favourite in schoolyards in Britain and beyond. The lyrics often change   in one variant, it is suggested in rhyme that the Fuhrer s remaining testicle now resides as something of a war trophy in the Albert Hall   but where does this claim come from, and is there any truth to it? Is there any truth that Hitler had one testicle? On balance it seems unlikely that Hitler only had one testicle, but there are conflicting arguments on both sides. That said, there have been several stories that, if true, would mean the song was actually based on anatomical fact. According to one, Hitler lost a testicle during the First World War after being hit by shrapnel at the battle of the Somme in 1916; another says the injury occurred much earlier, in childhood, during an altercation with a goat. It all seems to be the stuff of hearsay. Although Hitler was wounded at the Somme, it was in the thigh rather than the groin. What s more, that claim comes from many decades later from an unconfirmed source, a priest who supposedly took the confession of the German medic who treated Lance Corporal Hitler. Perhaps the single best piece of evidence that counters the claim that Hitler only had one testicle comes from the doctor who treated Hitler as a child, an Austrian Jew named Eduard Bloch who fled to the United States in 1940, insisted to American interrogators that the genitals of the future Fuhrer were  completely normal . Still, the seemingly endless fascination with Hitler s reproductive equipment and sexual proclivities has persisted over the decades. Years after the war, a new claim emerged that the Soviets had carried out an autopsy of Hitler after taking Berlin in 1945, in which they found he did indeed have a missing testicle. This is not widely accepted as credible, however.  | Did Hitler escape to Argentina after WW2? Was anything wrong with Hitler s testicle? In 2015, a German researcher was able to study the medical records made during an examination of Hitler at Landsberg Prison. He was held there after the failure of the Munich Beer Hall Putsch, the failed uprising he instigated in 1923. According to the notes written by Dr Josef Steiner Brin, Hitler was  healthy and strong , but did have a  right-side cryptorchidism , or an undescended right testicle.  | The history of the Hitler salute Where does the song  Hitler has only got one ball  come from? The song appeared in the early days of the Second World War. While its origins are unknown (over the years several people have claimed they wrote the lyrics to be used for propaganda purposes), it caught on with the British soldiers as a means of ridiculing Hitler. Crude and childish, it aimed to emasculate both the Nazi leader and his inner circle, by implying they were not full men. Singing about Hitler and co. not having the usual number of balls was to call them cowards too:  to have no balls  is another way to say someone has no courage or nerve. Ad By bringing Hitler s physical state into question, there may have been a further intention to the song in challenging the Nazis  claims about a master race of perfect humans. When they were talking all the time about tall, muscular blond-haired, blue-eyed Aryans, the song serves to illustrate how Hitler, and those around him, were far from meeting those standard themselves.",

        "title": "Why did Hitler choose the swastika as a Nazi symbol?",
        "content": "The swastika is today synonymous with Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime; a red and black symbol of the Second World War. But this hasn't always been the case   the swastika existed as a symbol long before it was adopted by the Nazis, and the symbol's story is longer and more complex than you might expect. Ad So how and why did the Nazis use the swastika, and what is the ancient origin of the symbol made infamous by Hitler? Why did Hitler choose the swastika? When Adolf Hitler began his rise to power and looked for a symbol to encapsulate his movement, the Nazi Party and a strong future for Germany, the swastika became the clear choice. German antiquarian Heinrich Schliemann had grown obsessed with finding Troy, the lost city of Greek mythology, and in 1868 he set out with his copy of The Iliad to search the Mediterranean. Schliemann's search led him to the mysterious mound of Hisarlik on the Aegean coast of Turkey. There, during the 1870s, Schliemann unearthed layers of civilisations dating back thousands of years, and declared the oldest to be Troy. The city of legend had been found   although it turned out to be a different layer than the one Schliemann thought   as well as a cache of jewellery, bronze, silver and gold. Yet in the ancient ruins he made another fateful discovery: some 1,800 depictions of a symbol that resembled a cross with bent arms: the swastika. News of Schliemann s sensational excavations spread far and wide, quickly followed by the swastika, which became a ubiquitous sign, visible throughout Europe and North America. At the same time, however, the swastika s long history saw it become a favourite of German nationalists, who subscribed to a warped theory that they had descended from an ancient  master race  known as the Aryans. This belief persisted into the 20th century, growing more pernicious until it appealed to Adolf Hitler, the leader of the burgeoning Nazi Party. Hitler understood the power of an image and knew it would give the Nazi ideals an historic foundation. He could not adequately reconcile his view of Germany s Christian history with the religion s historical Jewish connections   essentially, that Christ was himself Jewish   so the idea that Germans descended from a white master race with a tried and tested symbol had great appeal. And so the swastika, or hakenkreuz (hooked cross), became the emblem of the Nazi Party in 1920; Hitler himself took personal credit for designing the flag. It used the red, white and black of the old German imperial flag   a cunning move to link Germany's past with its future   but attributed new meanings to them. \"In red we see the social idea of the movement, in white the nationalistic idea, in the swastika the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man,\" wrote Hitler in his 1925 autobiographical manifesto, Mein Kampf. The new design became the national flag on 15 September 1935 during the mass annual rally at Nuremberg. On the same day, two race laws were passed prohibiting marriages between Germans and Jews and declaring that only those of German blood could be citizens of the Reich. And so the act of cultural, religious and social theft that was the appropriation of the swastika was complete. It ensured that the Nazi flag would be associated with evil   under which a brutal war raged, atrocities committed and some six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. What is the swastika? A cross with arms bent at right angles meant many things to many people, but had always been used as a sign of hope and positivity. It could represent good fortune or prosperity; symbolise the Sun or the infinity of creation; or, as it still does in several religions, evoke a sense of the divine and call for auspiciousness. The word swastika itself derives from the Sanskrit svastika, meaning \"conducive to well-being\". What is the history of the swastika? The oldest-known example of the swastika dates back some 15,000 years. Discovered in Ukraine in 1908, an ivory mammoth tusk carved into the shape of a bird includes an intricate pattern of connected swastikas on its body, which may have been used as a fertility symbol. There is no knowing how the design first came about. It may have simply been an elegant, easy-to-create geometric shape, although its inspiration possibly came from a comet in the night sky. It was also in Eastern Europe that single swastikas were carved by the Vinca culture during the Neolithic period, some 7,000 years ago, before they became widespread from the Bronze Age. The swastika symbolised the Sun to the Illyrians; became a common sight on Mesopotamian coins; appeared on vases and clothing in Greece; formed mosaic motifs in Rome, and stands in as a stylised cross in Celtic design. There are 27 swastikas on the Iron Age Battersea Shield, found in London in 1857, but the symbol had been in Britain long before that as the so-called Swastika Stone on Ilkley Moor, Yorkshire, from c2,000 BC, shows. This carving resembles the swastika s shape, although with more curved arms and added spots. Swastikas could be found in Roman mosaics, as evidenced in this one excavated at Lullingtone Roman Villa in Eynsford, Kent (Photo by English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images) The swastika, often known as a gammadion or fylflot, continued to be used throughout Europe, occasionally being subsumed into religious iconography. Early Christian art depicts the hooked cross to represent Christ's victory over death, while a left-facing version of the swastika showed up in reference to the Norse god Thor's hammer. Still a popular symbol in medieval times, the swastika can be seen today on surviving church decorations, coats of arms and on textile fragments from the 12th century thought to be from a dress owned by a Slav princess. The monastery school a young Adolf Hitler attended, Lambach Abbey in Austria, had swastikas carved on the stone and woodwork. Yet the influence of the swastika reached much further than can be explained by the migration of peoples over the centuries. It has appeared in several cultures across northern Africa, including as window decorations in churches in modern-day Ethiopia, while also showing up in the Mayan, Aztec and Kuna civilisations of South and Central America. A number of Native American and First Nation tribes of North America, such as the Navajo, Hopi and Passamaquoddy, also adopted the symbol, which they called  whirling logs . Swastikas are prevalent and potent symbols in several religions: there s a small one on the chest of this Buddha in Hong Kong s Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery (Photo by Victor Fraile/Corbis via Getty Images) Undoubtedly the most enduring relationship with the swastika began in Asia, especially in India, among followers of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, for whom it has served as a holy symbol for millennia. To Jains, the swastika represents one of the 24 Tirthankara, or saviours, while Buddhists regard the symbol as the footprints of the Buddha. For Hindus, the right-hand svastika   a term that emerged c500 BC   is a sign of surya (the Sun) and auspiciousness, so is used to mark entrances, offerings, ceremonies, festivals and each year's account books. The left-hand version, the sauvastika, is symbolic of the night and the goddess Kali. The swastika remains as spiritually significant today, in the face of the stigma towards the symbol in the West brought on by the Nazis. How did the swastika become a Nazi symbol? Heinrich Schliemann's discovery of Troy in the 1870s set in motion the events that transformed the swastika, a symbol of fortune and hope for thousands of years, into a hated and feared sign of fascism. He concluded it to be a \"significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors\" when he unearthed 1,800 examples, but his colleague, Emile-Louis Burnouf, thought differently. Knowing the symbol appeared in India, Burnouf studied a sacred Hindu text called the Rigveda and claimed to have found a connection between the swastika and an enigmatic ancient people, the Aryans. Burnouf studied a sacred Hindu text called the Rigveda and claimed to have found a connection between the swastika and an enigmatic ancient people, the Aryans Supposedly, this 'master race' of white-skinned warriors constituted the peak of human civilisation, conquering lands such as India and bringing the swastika with them. The word Aryan itself derived from Sanskrit, like svastika. Pots from the sixth-century had been found in Germany with swastikas on them and scholars noted the similarities between Sanskrit and German as further proof that the Aryans had come from Germany. But the whole notion of this 'pure' race, as well as being deeply racist, was based on a misunderstanding. The Sanskrit word for Aryan ( rya) actually meant \"honourable, respectable or noble\" and referred to a social or linguistic distinction, not a separate ethnic group. Before the Nazis, the swastika was widely adopted in the West as a symbol of luck and fortune (Photo by Rykoff Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) But the theory of the Aryans  existence grew in popularity from the mid-19th century. The unification of Germany in 1871, the same year Schliemann started work at Troy, led to a swell of uninhibited nationalism in the country and the idea that Germans descended from Aryans. To them, the discovery at Troy of their symbol, the swastika, proved they had been a dominant race. So while the swastika existed as a benign good-luck charm across Europe and North America, it simultaneously became an icon for German nationalists and anti-Semitic groups. What is the swastika a symbol of today? In the aftermath of World War II, publicly displaying the swastika was banned in Germany, where it remains illegal. Yet while reviled in the Western world, it continues to be a potent symbol with far-right and white-supremacist groups. In the US, where its use is permitted, incidents involving swastika flags and graffiti have increased in recent years, most infamously when neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. It can be seen seemingly everywhere in parts of the Indian subcontinent   from temple entrances to the front of taxis   and plays an important role in ceremonies and festivals But the swastika also remains a feature of worship for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. It can be seen seemingly everywhere in parts of the Indian subcontinent   from temple entrances to the front of taxis   and plays an important role in ceremonies and festivals. During Diwali   the Hindu festival of lights   the swastika is drawn with coloured sand, or rangoli, and depicted with lanterns to celebrate the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. In 2007, when German politicians attempted to introduce a swastika ban across the European Union, Hindus vehemently opposed the measure on religious grounds. Swastikas are drawn in coloured sand during Diwali celebrations (Photo by Shashi Sharma/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) Such disparate attitudes towards the swastika raises the question of whether the symbol   which for so long has been a force for good   can be reclaimed from its association with Hitler and the neo-Nazis who still display it. Would reclaiming the symbol mark the final defeat of the Third Reich and the hatred it advocated? Or is that impossible? The 20th-century corruption of the swastika came to represent so much of the horrors of Nazism that it should never be forgotten. Ad The answer, although not a neat one, may be that there will always be two utterly conflicting interpretations of the swastika, both of which are part of our history, present and future: one representing the worst of humanity and the other symbolising the best.",
        "target_summary": "The swastika, now an almost universally chilling emblem of Adolf Hitler's brutal Nazi regime and the horrors of World War II, possesses a far older, richer, and more complex history than its infamous association suggests. For millennia, this cross with bent arms was a ubiquitous symbol of hope, positivity, and good fortune, its story tracing back some 15,000 years.\n\nIts ancient journey began with the Sanskrit word \"svastika,\" meaning \"conducive to well-being.\" The oldest known example, discovered in Ukraine, dates to the Stone Age on a carved mammoth tusk, potentially a fertility symbol. From there, it spread across the globe: etched by the Vinca culture in the Neolithic period, representing the Sun to Illyrians, appearing on Mesopotamian coins, Greek vases, Roman mosaics, and Celtic designs. Its presence spanned Europe, from the Iron Age Battersea Shield in Britain to medieval church decorations, and stretched into North Africa, the Mayan, Aztec, and Kuna civilizations, and among numerous Native American tribes, who called it \"whirling logs.\" Most profoundly, the swastika has been a sacred symbol in Asian religions—Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism—for millennia, signifying auspiciousness, divine connection, and the footprints of the Buddha, a role it maintains today amidst Western stigma.\n\nThis ancient symbol's journey to infamy began in the 1870s with German antiquarian Heinrich Schliemann's sensational excavation of Troy. Among the ruins, he unearthed 1,800 depictions of the swastika, initially concluding it a \"significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors.\" However, his colleague, Emile-Louis Burnouf, critically misinterpreted its appearance in India, forging a spurious link between the swastika and an enigmatic \"Aryan master race.\" This deeply racist theory, which falsely claimed a pure, white-skinned lineage originating from Germany and conquering lands, gained insidious traction among German nationalists following the country's unification in 1871. To them, the swastika became proof of their supposed Aryan dominance.\n\nAdolf Hitler, seeking a powerful emblem for his burgeoning Nazi Party, eagerly embraced this distorted narrative. He understood the image's potency to provide a historical foundation for his movement, a \"hooked cross\" (Hakenkreuz) to signify the \"struggle for the victory of the Aryan man.\" In 1920, Hitler personally designed the Nazi flag, strategically incorporating the red, white, and black of the old German imperial flag but imbuing them with new, sinister meanings. By 1935, this symbol of cultural and social theft became the national flag, concurrently with the passage of horrific race laws that stripped Jewish people of their citizenship and rights. Under this stolen emblem, a brutal war raged, atrocities were committed, and six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.\n\nToday, while the swastika is reviled and legally banned in Germany and much of the West, where it is still adopted by far-right and white-supremacist groups, it remains a vibrant, positive religious symbol in the Indian subcontinent. It adorns temples, vehicles, and plays a vital role in ceremonies and festivals like Diwali. This profound duality leaves the question of its reclamation open: can a symbol so deeply corrupted ever shed its association with humanity's worst horrors, or will it forever embody two utterly conflicting interpretations – one of ancient good, the other of unspeakable evil?",

        "content": "What was the Beer Hall Putsch? On 8 November 1923, Adolf Hitler strode into a beer hall, jumped on to a chair, and fired a single bullet into the ceiling. Ad  The National Revolution has begun,  he bellowed to his startled audience.  The hall is under the control of 600 heavily armed men. No one is allowed to leave.  It was the most dramatic of entrances, and one that would signal the start of a defining episode in Hitler s early life: the Munich beer hall putsch. A speaker addresses a crowd in Marienplatz, Munich during the beer hall putsch. Hitler planned to seize the Bavarian city before leading a march on Berlin. (Photo by Shutterstock) Hitler s aim that autumn night was to seize Munich and use the city as a base from which to overthrow the Weimar Republic. Yet little did he know as stood on top of the table that his  national revolution  was about to fall flat on its face. Why did the putsch take place in a beer hall? Hitler had chosen the location of his coup   the B rgerbr ukeller, a large beer hall in the centre of Munich   for a good reason. For it was here, on that November evening, that Gustav von Kahr, state commissioner of Bavaria, was due to deliver a speech to Munich government officials. Hitler, who had been leader of the National Socialist German Workers  Party (better known to history as the Nazis) since July 1921, decided to hijack this meeting to announce a  March on Berlin , where he planned to have himself installed as German leader. He had already won over the First World War leader General Erich Ludendorff   and assumed that Kahr and the Bavarian establishment would support him, too. What Hitler did not know was that, on 6 November, Kahr had met leading paramilitary organisations in Munich, telling them the Bavarian government would not support any revolutionary action designed to bring down the Weimar Republic. General Otto von Lossow, head of the Bavarian Reichswehr, and Colonel Hans Ritter von Seisser, the head of the Bavarian State Police, also opposed Hitler s proposed coup. On the podcast | Everything you wanted to know about the Weimar Germany What happened duing the Beer Hall Putsch? In the minutes following Hitler s entrance into the beer hall, Kahr was barely in a position to oppose the Nazis swarming into the building. Standing at the speaker s podium, he was led at gunpoint to an adjoining room, accompanied by Seisser, Lossow and Ernst P hner, the former Munich chief of police. Hitler threatened to kill them and himself, too, if they refused to join his march on the German capital. In the meantime, Ludendorff had turned up, telling Kahr, Sesser and Lossow that he supported Hitler s plan. However, Ludendorff was somewhat surprised to hear that, in Hitler s proposed national government, he had been given the lesser role of commander of the army, as Hitler had already appointed himself  dictator of Germany . At 10.30pm, Hitler left the beer hall to go and calm down a clash between an SA paramilitary unit and government troops at the local barracks of the Army Engineers a few miles away. He left Ludendorff to control Kahr, Lossow and Seisser. It was a huge error of judgment: Ludendorff had soon allowed the three to leave. Members of the SA arrive at the Munich beer hall during the putsch. Tensions between Nazi militia and the Bavarian police soon erupted into violence. (Photo by Presse-Illustrationen Heinrich Hoffmann/ ullstein bild) Once free, Kahr took measures to strangle Hitler s would-be revolution at birth. German president, Friedrich Ebert, gave full executive power over Bavaria to General von Seeckt, who issued a manifesto warning that the army would deal sternly with all conspirators. And so, a few minutes before midnight, Hitler accepted that his attempt to overthrow Weimar democracy had failed. Yet he wasn t about to go quietly into the night. As a final and futile revolutionary gesture, the following day the Nazi leader led a demonstration, numbering 3,000, through Munich, with Ludendorff at his side. Their aim was to march to the War Ministry and capture it, but as they approached the Feldherrnhalle, in the city centre, they found their path barred by a heavily armed cordon of the Bavarian state police. Several shots were fired on both sides. It left 14 National Socialists and four police officers dead. What happened after the Beer Hall Putsch? When it was all over, Hitler turned up at the house of his close friend, the wealthy landowner Ernst  Putzi  Hanfstaengl. It didn t take the authorities long to catch up with him. On 11 November, Hitler was arrested and driven to Landsberg Fortress, a modern prison 33 miles to the west of Munich, to await trial on a charge of treason. Why did the Beer Hall Putsch fail? The coup had failed because Hitler allowed his party to become a purely paramilitary organisation, involved in an ill-defined conspiracy. Hitler had whipped up his own supporters into a frenzy, only to find that he had already been deserted by his supposed co-conspirators. On the day of Hitler s arrest, Gustav Stresemann, the German chancellor, gave a speech in which he reflected on recent events in Munich, admitting:  Germany was now confronted with the demand for a dictatorship.  But he stressed that anyone thinking a dictatorship would improve matters was making a  great mistake . Stresemann said a  destructive force  such as Hitler could never have provided competent government for Germany, even if he had succeeded. But, of course, Hitler hadn t succeeded. His coup had ended in abject failure. What happened to Hitler after the Beer Hall Putsch? As his trial got under way at Munich s First District People s Court, on 26 February 1924, his political career now seemingly lay in tatters, his dreams of seizing power cast to the wind. A long prison sentence surely awaited. A photograph of the beer hall putsch trial at Munich s People s Court. (Photo by INTERFOTO/TopFoto) Yet Hitler wasn t quite finished yet. That much became apparent on 27 March 1924 when, after four weeks of worldwide press coverage of his trial, he delivered his closing speech. It lasted for more than an hour and would be remembered as one of the most important of his life. Hitler began by saying the Weimar Republic was founded on a  crime of high treason  in which the German army had been  stabbed in the back  by socialists and Jews. As the country suffered one catastrophe after another, the democratic leaders of the republic remained, he argued, subservient to the Allied powers. Germany was reduced to a pawn on the international chessboard. The Treaty of Versailles was, Hitler raged,  immorality in 440 clauses . As for the League of Nations, its only function was to guarantee the  corrupt peace treaty . Now, this  so-called government was hauling German heroes into court and branding them traitors . Respect for law would only return when the president of Germany was tried for high treason. Looking straight at the judge, Hitler concluded his speech, with the following statement:  Even if you pronounce us guilty a thousand times, the eternal goddess of the eternal court of history will smilingly tear up the verdict of this court and she will acquit us.  Hitler had undoubtedly seized his moment in the international spotlight. In that court in central Munich he had somehow turned a bungled fiasco into a triumph. On 1 April, Georg Neithardt, a nationalist member of the rightwing Bavarian judiciary, delivered the verdicts. Hitler was found guilty of high treason and sentenced to five years, with a reduction for the four months he had already served. This made him eligible for release on parole after just six months. He also received a fine of 200 gold marks. The other chief defendant in the trial, General Erich Ludendorff   who arrived to hear the verdicts in full general s regalia, displaying all his medals   was amazingly acquitted of all charges. What was the impact of the Beer Hall Putsch? News of the verdicts shocked not only the German press, but newspapers around the world. The leading SPD newspaper, Vorw rts, condemned the trial as  a farce and a mockery , suggesting it was such an obvious injustice that the judge should be put on trial himself. The Times asked if the crime of high treason was  worth more than a mere six months in prison? , and The New York Times regarded the verdicts as  an excellent joke for All Fools  Day . Far from snuffing out Hitler s political aspirations, the trial had provided him with the oxygen of global publicity. It had made him famous. To many, he was no longer the buffoon who had botched a coup in a beer hall, but a true patriot who tried to rescue Germany from democratic chaos. Hitler s time in prison also led him to begin writing Mein Kampf (My Struggle), which became the  Bible of National Socialism , in which he cast himself in the role of political and philosophical Messiah. Part autobiography, part ideological manifesto and part blueprint for political action, Mein Kampf remains an important book for understanding the essence of Nazi ideology, crystallising his virulent hatred for Jewish people and Marxists and setting out his living space in eastern Europe. Nazism s sacred text How Hitler used his time in prison to produce a chilling political manifesto, Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler spent just eight months and 20 days incarcerated in Landsberg Fortress for his part in the Munich beer hall putsch. To many onlookers, he had been handed a mystifyingly lenient punishment for an audacious act of treason. Yet that was time enough for the Nazi leader to refine his political ideology, formulate his future plans for Germany and begin committing them to paper. The result was a 782-page manifesto published over two volumes. Hitler called it Mein Kampf (My Struggle). The first volume of Mein Kampf presents a heavily redacted autobiographical story from Hitler s early life up to the founding of the National Socialist Party (NSDAP) in February 1920. The second volume, written after his release, was more of a political manifesto, developing many of the ideas he mentioned in the first volume, but in more detail. The dominant theoretical concepts in both volumes are race and space. Hitler depicts human history not as a class struggle, as Marx would have it, but a Darwinian struggle for existence between the strong and pure  Aryan  races over the  weak and mixed-race  ones. The key objective of Hitler s racial policy is to create a pure Aryan folk community of Germans, which he called Volksgemeinschaft. This  master race  would then become  the highest species of humanity on this Earth . If the Aryan possessed all the positive qualities Hitler ad- mired, the opposite was true of the two key enemies he outlined in Mein Kampf: Jews and Marxists. A virulent hatred of Marxism runs through many pages in the book. Hitler s chief desire if he gained power was to  eliminate  or  exterminate  Marxism in German politics. There is a similar passionate and violent hatred of Jews, especially in the chapter  Nation and Race , in the first volume. Hitler defined Jews, not as a religious group, but as a united race planning a  world conspiracy . A large amount of space in Mein Kampf is devoted to foreign policy. Hitler had entered politics to demand the end of the Treaty of Versailles, primarily by settling accounts with France, thereby restoring Germany s 1914 borders. This implied a future war concentrated in western Europe. Yet the revision of the Treaty of Versailles was to be a mere prelude to gaining living space in eastern Europe. In Mein Kampf, Hitler sets out his belief that the Soviet Union had been militarily weakened by being under the control of  Jewish-Bolsheviks . It was, he concluded,  ripe for collapse , and would be subjugated through a war of conquest.  | Mein Kampf: what happened to Hitler s money after his death? At 12.15pm on 20 December 1924, Hitler walked out of Landsburg Fortress. The New York Times ran an article to coincide with his release under the headline:  Hitler Tamed by Prison.  The paper reported that the  demi-god of reactionary extremists  looked much wiser as he left prison, noting that his behaviour during imprisonment had convinced the authorities he was no longer to be feared.  It is believed he will retire to private life and return to Austria, the country of his birth.  Hitler was, of course, planning nothing of the sort. While in prison, he had spent his time assessing his failure, learning from it, and, above all, formulating his next move on the political stage. He concluded that, to succeed, National Socialism needed a clear ideology and a national organisation   and that the path to power lay through votes in elections, not brute force. Put that way, the Munich Beer Hall Putsch marked the birth of Hitler as a politician, and the end of his career as a beer-hall agitator. It was the true start of his road to power.

        "target_summary": "In November 1923, Adolf Hitler, then leader of the nascent Nazi Party, dramatically burst into Munich's Bürgerbräukeller, firing a single bullet into the ceiling to silence the startled crowd. \"The National Revolution has begun,\" he bellowed, announcing his audacious plan to overthrow the Weimar Republic. His grandiose aim was to seize Munich, then lead a triumphal march on Berlin, mistakenly confident in the backing of key Bavarian officials and the revered World War I leader, General Erich Ludendorff.\n\nHitler had chosen the beer hall precisely because State Commissioner Gustav von Kahr was addressing local officials there. Hitler dramatically hijacked Kahr's address, detaining him and other leading figures, General Otto von Lossow and Colonel Hans Ritter von Seisser, at gunpoint in an adjoining room, threatening them with death if they refused to join his cause. Though Ludendorff subsequently arrived, lending his prestige, he was surprisingly assigned a subordinate role. In a critical lapse of judgment, Hitler departed to quell a street clash, entrusting the guarded officials to Ludendorff. This proved a fatal miscalculation; the venerated general inexplicably allowed Kahr and the others to slip away.\n\nFreed, Kahr immediately mobilized Bavaria's forces, decisively strangling the would-be revolution. By midnight, Hitler's grand scheme had unraveled into abject failure. Yet, not one to fade quietly, Hitler led a defiant, albeit futile, demonstration of 3,000 the following day. This procession, marching through Munich, clashed violently with a heavily armed police cordon, resulting in the deaths of 14 National Socialists and four police officers, decisively crushing the coup.\n\nHitler was soon arrested and charged with high treason. His subsequent trial in February 1924, initially poised to shatter his political aspirations, was shrewdly transformed into an unexpected propaganda triumph. From the witness stand, he masterfully spun his bungled coup into a patriotic act, vehemently assailing the \"treasonous\" Weimar Republic, the \"immoral\" Treaty of Versailles, and perceived \"Jewish-Bolshevik\" conspiracies. Despite a guilty verdict, Hitler received an astonishingly lenient sentence: five years, convertible to parole after merely six months, ultimately serving just eight. General Ludendorff, astonishingly, was acquitted outright. This outcome, which stunned the world, inadvertently transformed Hitler from a bumbling putschist into a perceived national hero for many.\n\nWithin the walls of Landsberg Fortress, Hitler penned \"Mein Kampf\" (My Struggle), a chilling manifesto that would become the blueprint for Nazism. It meticulously articulated his virulent racial ideology, asserting Aryan supremacy, expressing profound hatred for Jews and Marxists, and laying out his ominous vision for \"living space\" (Lebensraum) in Eastern Europe.\n\nReleased in December 1924, Hitler emerged from Landsberg Fortress not \"tamed\" as contemporary headlines prematurely declared, but fundamentally transformed and strategically emboldened. He had meticulously analyzed the putsch's failure, concluding that a direct, forceful coup was not the path to ultimate power. Instead, the future lay in leveraging votes through elections and meticulously constructing a national political movement. Thus, the Beer Hall Putsch, though a tactical failure, ironically marked a pivotal genesis: the end of Hitler the beer-hall agitator and the chilling inauguration of Hitler the calculating politician, now set firmly on his inexorable path to absolute power.",

        "content": "In 1943 the fortunes of war began to turn against Nazi Germany. Early that year, the battle of Stalingrad   widely hailed as a turning point in the Second World War   inaugurated a long, steady advance by the Red Army on the eastern front. This was interrupted only briefly by the battle of Kursk, the largest tank battle in history, which the Germans lost comprehensively. Ad In the south, Hitler s Italian ally, Benito Mussolini, was deposed in July 1943 after the Allies launched their invasion of Sicily. The Germans now felt obliged to occupy mainland Italy, diverting much-needed troops from the east, but were steadily beaten back by the Allies from September onwards. The end of July saw the mass bombing of Hamburg, with the damage inflicted on German cities by Allied raids becoming ever more severe. All the while, morale on the home front began to fall, and the Nazi Party, the Gestapo and the SS started to tighten the screws of the repression that had played such an important part in creating the regime in the first place. Active Nazis rejoiced in the return, as they saw it, of the  time of struggle , the old days before the Third Reich was securely established, when they were fighting against their enemies, real or imagined, on all sides.  | Should we be glad the 1944 July Plot to kill Hitler failed? By 1944 growing numbers of middle-ranking army officers, backed by a few more senior figures, had become so despairing of victory that they were plotting to remove Adolf Hitler and sue for peace   a futile enterprise, since the Allies had agreed to demand unconditional surrender early the previous year. On 20 July 1944, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg detonated a time-bomb in Hitler s eastern headquarters, but it didn t kill the Nazi dictator and the coup failed. Already suspicious of the armed forces and contemptuous of their leadership, Hitler now lost all faith in them. They were either cowards or traitors. Willpower was what mattered in his view, willpower would conquer everything, and willpower was precisely what they lacked. On the podcast | Frank McDonough discusses how Nazi Germany fell from the peak of its power in 1940 to disastrous defeat A failed miracle In a desperate attempt to shore up morale, the manufacture of  miracle weapons  was trumpeted by Joseph Goebbels  propaganda apparatus, including nerve gases, flying bombs, ground-to-air missiles, rockets, air-conditioned submarines and even an atom bomb. Hitler placed particular faith in the effects of a jet-engine fighter plane, the Messerschmitt Me 262, but it had little impact on fighting before the end of the war. These projects dissipated resources too widely, and depended on supplies of raw materials that were already drying up. Hitler ordered a concentration on the V1 flying bomb and the V2 rocket, but they could not be manufactured in sufficient quantities to have a major impact. Moreover, the fact that the  V  stood for Vergeltung,  retribution , amounted to a confession that they were unlikely to change the course of the war. For a while, however, they gave at least some encouragement to Hitler s faithful that the tide could still be turned. The public, as the SS reported, were increasingly sceptical.  | Reporting on Hitler: how foreign correspondents in Nazi Germany battled to expose the truth In these final months, Hitler looked to history for inspiration. The call-up of men previously exempted from military service, above all because they were too young or too old, into the Volkssturm (People s Storm) deliberately echoed the legendary popular mobilisation in Prussia against Napoleon Bonaparte. The official date for the launch of the Volkssturm, 18 October 1944, was the anniversary of Napoleon s defeat at Leipzig in 1813. Goebbels also commissioned and released an expensive new colour movie, Kolberg, telling the fictionalised story of a decision by the people of a town besieged by Napoleon to fight on to the bitter end whatever the cost. It was an implicit invitation to the Germans of Hitler s day to sacrifice themselves in what was claimed to be the national interest. It had little impact, since it had a very limited release. The movie also wasted precious resources of manpower for the military scenes, which involved thousands of men who might otherwise have been fighting at the front. The Volkssturm itself, poorly equipped and badly trained, was largely pointless except as a propaganda exercise: 175,000 men and boys were killed before the war came to an end.  | The stomach for the fight: the food policies used by the Nazis to maintain control in the Third Reich On 16 December 1944, Hitler attempted a last throw of the dice, launching a fresh offensive in the west, where he believed that he could repeat the triumph of 1940 in the Ardennes   another piece of historical wishful thinking. Some 200,000 troops and large quantities of armour and equipment were transferred to the battle of the Bulge, largely from the eastern front. When Hitler s acting army chief of staff, Heinz Guderian, told him that the situation on the eastern front was at breaking point, and that it was folly to divert troops to the west, the dictator screamed:  You don t need to lecture me! I ve been leading the German armies in the field for five years  I m better informed than you are!  If the troops believed in victory, Hitler told his adjutant Nicolaus von Below, then victory would be theirs. To begin with, the German armies scored some successes, enthusing Hitler with a fresh confidence, before the overwhelming superiority of the Allies brought them to a halt. The net effect in the end was to weaken the German defences in the east. After the Ardennes offensive was broken, Hitler told Below:  I know the war is lost. The enemy s superiority is too great.  He had been let down by the Luftwaffe and betrayed by traitors in the army.  We won t surrender, never. We can go under. But we ll take a world with us.  Death and destruction were all he could think of in his hour of despair.

Once more, he blamed everything that had, in his mind, gone wrong with Germany since the First World War on  the Jewish-international global conspiracy , in which latterly Franklin D Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill had been no more than willing puppets. He still insisted on continued uncompromising resistance. When Warsaw was evacuated by the retreating German army, he lost his temper and had the staff officers who had issued the retreat signals arrested by the Gestapo. A crack SS division, the Leibstandarte, suffered heavy losses in its defence of the Hungarian oilfields, and was rewarded for its defeat by Hitler s sending SS chief Heinrich Himmler to strip its surviving soldiers of their armbands, a very public humiliation that caused some of the troops to shoot themselves. Hitler did not care. By insisting on fighting to the end, he sacrificed the lives of millions of his soldiers. More than a third of all German troops killed during the war died in January to May 1945, when it was clear to most Germans that the war was already lost. By insisting on fighting to the end, Hitler sacrificed the lives of millions of his soldiers. More than a third of all German troops killed during the war died in January to May 1945 The destruction of German towns and cities from the air was turning more and more of them into heaps of rubble. Power cuts and water shortages became more frequent with the destruction of gas and electricity generating plants, power lines and underground pipes. More than half a million civilians were killed in the raids. Living conditions began to worsen. In the autumn of 1944, for the first time, the Nazi authorities began to make serious reductions of food and other rations. The supply situation steadily deteriorated from now on, and was not to recover until many months after the end of the war. On 19 March 1945, Hitler issued the infamous  Nero order , commanding local authorities and plant managers to destroy their facilities in the face of the Allied advance in order to prevent them from being used by the enemy. The order, however, was widely disobeyed by local authorities, encouraged by armaments minister Albert Speer. After reading a memorandum Speer had presented to him rejecting the order because the German people would need the basic necessities if they were to survive after the war, Hitler told him that it was not necessary to worry about the German people,  for the nation has proved to be the weaker, and the future belongs solely to the stronger eastern nation. In any case only those who are inferior will remain after this struggle, for the good have already been killed.

To begin with, he climbed the stairs to the garden quite frequently to walk his dog, Blondi, and on 20 March 1945 he went up to inspect and decorate a small detachment of Hitler Youth who had been defending the city. But as the Red Army moved into Berlin, it became too dangerous. On 20 April, his 56th birthday, he went up for the last time; a further attempt to come out, a week later, was frustrated by Soviet shelling. Inside the bunker, the foul air and failing latrine system were beginning to make life unbearable. The celebration of Hitler s birthday in the bunker was muted, with Hitler himself participating only reluctantly. Outside on the surface, the dull thuds of Soviet artillery fire could already be heard, the noise penetrating through the thick concrete into the room. By this time, Hitler had almost wholly lost touch with reality. He continued in his daily military conferences to move little flags representing army divisions around Berlin on a map, ordering a tank unit led by Felix Steiner, a senior SS officer, to launch a counter-attack, supported by aircraft and infantry, in which he expected that  the Russians will suffer the greatest defeat, the bloodiest defeat in their history before the gates of the city of Berlin . But the troops and the tanks simply didn t exist. Told the attack had not taken place, Hitler lost all self-control, screaming that the army   and now, too, the SS   had betrayed him. Everything was lost, he cried, shaking with rage. Hermann G ring must negotiate a peace deal with the Allies. He would stay in the bunker and take his own life. Informed by telephone of Hitler s breakdown, Goebbels moved into the bunker with his wife and children, determined to stay with him until the end, then create a heroic myth, just as he had tried to do after Stalingrad, of self-sacrifice for posterity. Hitler s breakdown on 22 April 1945 inaugurated the final act in the squalid and pointless drama being played out in the bunker. At last, the spell broken, his lieutenants, with the exception of Goebbels, began to desert him. Told of Hitler s rant, G ring sent a telegram to Berlin assuming his rights as his nominated successor unless he heard otherwise. Hitler had already lost faith in him because of the failure of the Luftwaffe, and now he reacted by instructing the Reich Marshal to resign all his offices. Within a few hours, G ring was under house arrest, an SS unit stationed outside his house. Worse than any of this, Hitler discovered that Himmler had been negotiating with neutral Sweden behind his back for Germany s surrender to be conveyed to the Allies. Declaring this to be  the most shameful betrayal in human history , Hitler dismissed him from all his offices.

His body was to be burned until no trace of it remained, he said. Summoning a local Berlin official to the bunker, he now underwent a formal, legal ceremony of marriage with Eva Braun. Dictating his last will and testament, he appointed Grand Admiral Karl D nitz as his successor, and blamed the bombing of German cities on the Jews, who he believed were steering the Allies from behind. They had been forced to  expiate their guilt, though through more humane means . Such an admission expressed a belief that the gas chambers of Auschwitz and other extermination camps were a  humane  method of killing, as well as a feeling of triumph that, with the Holocaust, he had exacted on the Jews what he imagined to be a justified revenge. Privately, Hitler admitted to his secretary Traudl Junge that  National Socialism is dead . Unrestrained in his boundless egotism, he told her that the Germans had not been ready to carry out the tasks he had allotted to them. On 30 April 1945, after saying farewell once more to his secretaries, Hitler retired with Eva to his study at half-past three in the afternoon. A few minutes later a single shot was fired. Gingerly opening the door, Hitler s valet, Heinz Linge, saw the dictator s lifeless body slumped on the sofa, blood oozing from a gunshot wound in his right temple. Eva Braun (now Hitler) was beside him, a strong smell of bitter almonds coming from her corpse. She had taken cyanide. Linge and Hitler s adjutant, Otto G nsche, wrapped the bodies in blankets and, with the help of SS guards, carried them up the long staircases to the Reich Chancellery garden, where they doused them with petrol and set them alight. So thoroughly were the bodies burned that only the teeth remained among the ashes, later to be identified by a technician who had worked for Hitler s dentist. The American military newspaper The Stars and Stripes announces the f hrer s death on 2 May 1945 (Photo by Peter Horree / Alamy Stock Photo) Public executions Hitler left only death and destruction behind him. Many ordinary Germans had gradually lost faith in his regime as defeat followed defeat, and life in Germany s devastated cities had progressively become more difficult for them to sustain. Instead of being restored to greatness, as Hitler had proclaimed, the country lay in ruins. Yet there had been no general rising against the regime. By the last months, any kind of dereliction of duty, open defeatism, or attempt to negotiate a local surrender to the advancing Allied forces incurred public execution at the hands of the SS and other fanatics. Many Germans carried on resisting the enemy out of fear of what might happen to them, justified enough in the case of the Red Army, whose troops carried out innumerable shootings and rapes of civilians as they advanced into Germany. By 1945 most Germans were motivated above all by nationalism, the feeling that what they were defending was their country rather than the Nazi regime that had taken it over. Civil servants and administrators continued with their daily bureaucratic routines more out of a sense of duty or ingrained habit than anything else. Hitler s charismatic authority endured almost to the end. More than a decade of his rule had left people unable to imagine life without him   in thousands of cases literally so, as a huge wave of suicides rolled across Germany, particularly among government ministers, generals and Nazi Party officials. When Hitler s death became known, and the war ended, allegiance to the Third Reich among the people of Germany vanished almost overnight. Ad This article was first published in the November 2022 issue of BBC History Magazine",
        "target_summary": "By 1943, the tide of World War II had dramatically turned against Nazi Germany. On the Eastern Front, the Red Army's relentless advance, inaugurated by the pivotal victory at Stalingrad and cemented by the comprehensive German defeat at Kursk, heralded the beginning of the end. In the south, the Allied invasion of Sicily in July toppled Mussolini, forcing Germany to divert precious troops to occupy Italy, only to be steadily pushed back by the advancing Allies. Concurrently, Allied air raids intensified, culminating in the devastating mass bombing of Hamburg, which shattered German cities and eroded morale on the home front. As despair grew, the Nazi regime tightened its repressive grip, even as some hardline Nazis paradoxically welcomed a \"return to the time of struggle.\"\n\nThe escalating desperation among military leadership manifested in the July Plot of 1944, a brave but ultimately futile attempt by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and other officers to assassinate Hitler and negotiate peace. Hitler survived, emerging even more convinced of his own infallible will, viewing his military leaders with contempt as cowards or traitors.\n\nIn a desperate bid to bolster collapsing morale, Joseph Goebbels' propaganda machine trumpeted the promise of \"miracle weapons.\" From nerve gases and advanced jet fighters to the V1 flying bombs and V2 rockets, these highly resource-intensive projects proved too limited in production and impact to stem the Allied onslaught. They served more as a confession of impending defeat than a harbinger of victory, and despite initial encouragement, the public grew increasingly skeptical.\n\nFurther detached from reality, Hitler sought inspiration in historical parallels, invoking legendary Prussian resistance against Napoleon. He resurrected the Volkssturm, drafting old men and young boys into a poorly equipped and largely symbolic militia, and commissioned the lavish movie \"Kolberg\" to inspire national sacrifice. Both endeavors proved largely pointless, consuming vital resources and lives for minimal strategic gain.\n\nIn December 1944, Hitler gambled his remaining strength on a final, audacious offensive in the Ardennes, the \"Battle of the Bulge.\" Despite desperate pleas to prioritize the crumbling Eastern Front, he delusionally believed he could repeat his 1940 triumph. While initially achieving some success, the overwhelming Allied power soon halted the German advance, further depleting critical resources and fatally weakening defenses in the East. In the grim aftermath, Hitler conceded the war was lost, yet defiantly vowed never to surrender, expressing a grim resolve to drag the world down with Germany.\n\nAs defeat spiraled, Hitler retreated into increasing isolation, blaming a \"Jewish-international global conspiracy\" for Germany's woes. He commanded uncompromising resistance, punishing any sign of retreat or defeatism with brutal swiftness. This fanatical insistence led to millions of German soldiers dying in the war's final months, long after victory was an impossibility. German cities lay in rubble, civilian casualties mounted, and basic necessities grew scarce. Hitler's infamous \"Nero order\" to destroy all infrastructure was largely defied by those who recognized the need for post-war survival; he chillingly declared the German people \"weaker\" and unworthy of survival.\n\nConfined to his Berlin bunker from February 1945, Hitler's grip on reality completely dissolved. He continued to move phantom divisions on maps, ordering impossible counter-attacks against the advancing Red Army, and descended into furious rants against his \"betraying\" army and SS. As his lieutenants, save for the fanatically loyal Goebbels, began to desert him, Hitler learned of Himmler's secret surrender negotiations and Göring's attempt to seize power, reacting with outbursts of rage and dismissals.\n\nOn April 29, 1945, horrified by photographs of Mussolini's ignominious demise, Hitler married Eva Braun and dictated his final will, blaming the Jews for Germany's destruction and cynically affirming the \"humane\" nature of the Holocaust as justified revenge. Privately, he acknowledged National Socialism's death, blaming the German people for failing him. The next day, April 30, with Soviet shells echoing through the bunker, Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide. Their bodies, doused in petrol and set alight, were almost entirely consumed by flames, preventing the public spectacle Hitler had so feared.\n\nHitler left behind a nation in ruins and millions dead. Though faith in the regime had waned, fear of Nazi reprisals and the brutal advance of the Red Army meant no widespread uprising occurred. Most Germans fought on out of nationalism rather than allegiance to the regime, a system whose charismatic authority had so deeply permeated society that many could not imagine life without it. Yet, with Hitler's death and the war's end, the Third Reich's hold on Germany vanished almost instantaneously.",

        "content": "(Meet the powerful yokai that inspired the demon king in  Demon Slayer ) In Mesopotamia during the 1st millennium B.C., purveyors of magic called a ipu staved off and expelled demons that brought illness and chaos. As spiritual healers, a ipu were esteemed protectors who used amulets, performed elaborate rituals and, when needed, engaged helper demon figures in their efforts. The ancient Greek word daimon from which the modern  demon  derives referred to god-like spirits and supernatural forces. While a daimon could be good or evil, the latter was a malevolent force that needed to be cast out or exorcized. The 1st century A.D. historian Flavius Josephus recounted the story of Eleazar, a man who freed others from a demon by drawing it out of his nostrils and repeatedly invoking King Solomon s name, attesting to a form of exorcism in Jewish tradition as well. (The wealthy, wise reign of King Solomon made Israel prosper) This bronze Mesopotamian booklet presents an ancient exorcism and is housed at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Photograph by Photo Josse, Bridgeman Image Christianity and exorcism With the growth of Christianity during the first three centuries A.D., the established themes of the rite found even stronger footing. Possession and exorcism became a means to unite the Christian faithful and vindicate their beliefs in the wake of religious persecution. (In Zanzibar, a traditional herbalist exorcises evil spirits) The spread of Christianity meant paganism took on an evil connotation, transforming non-Christian beliefs into something that needed to be exorcized. As a result, renouncing paganism as an evil became a requirement for baptism into the Christian faith. Falling back under the influence of a pagan belief was, therefore, akin to possession. Exorcism in this context was a voluntary mechanism used to strengthen both the Christian faith and the Christian community. (Biblical stories of Jesus  birth reveal intriguing clues about his times) Exorcism served to legitimize Christianity and, by the 4th century A.D., found extensive use in pre-baptismal contexts. Converts and aspiring Christians underwent daily morning exorcism in the lead up to baptism. On the day of baptism, a bishop literally blew evil influences off of them through a process called exsufflation. In the moments before being baptized, the individual was anointed with oil that had itself been exorcized. (What does it take to become a saint in the modern age?) Outside of baptism, churchmen carried out exorcism by laying hands on the possessed while commanding evil spirits to leave their bodies. Christians in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages could exorcize themselves, so to speak, by calling on a saint as an intercessor, going to a shrine, and appealing for aid from a sacred entity to get closer to God and further away from evil.",
        "target_summary": "The ancient practice of exorcism, a ritualistic expulsion of malevolent forces, boasts a rich history predating its strong Christian association. In 1st millennium B.C. Mesopotamia, esteemed *ašipu*, masters of magic, meticulously performed rituals, utilized amulets, and even enlisted helper demons to combat spirits of illness and chaos. This early spiritual warfare, evident in the Greek \"daimon\" encompassing both divine and harmful forces, saw the latter demanding ritual expulsion. Jewish tradition also recorded such cleansing rites, like Eleazar invoking King Solomon's name, with a bronze Mesopotamian booklet at the Louvre serving as a tangible testament to these ancient practices.\n\nWith the rise of Christianity, exorcism dramatically deepened its roots and broadened its significance. Amidst persecution, it became a potent instrument for solidifying Christian identity and validating beliefs. Non-Christian \"pagan\" traditions were strategically reframed as inherently evil, transforming them into entities requiring explicit exorcism. Renouncing paganism thus became a crucial prerequisite for Christian baptism, equating any backsliding with spiritual possession and reinforcing community faith.\n\nBy the 4th century A.D., exorcism was intimately interwoven with Christian conversion. Aspiring believers underwent daily morning exorcisms before baptism, culminating in a bishop's exsufflation—a literal expulsion of evil influences—and anointing with specially exorcized oil. Beyond these transformational rites, churchmen performed exorcisms by laying hands on the possessed, while ordinary Christians could seek spiritual cleansing by invoking saints or visiting sacred shrines, actively engaging with the divine to repel evil and draw closer to God.",

The word itself is peculiar, yet it s now an almost universal sign of the supposedly impossible. While experts debate the exact origins of abracadabra, the word is undeniably ancient. Abracadabra first appears in the writings of Quintus Serenus Sammonicus more than 1,800 years ago as a magical remedy for fever, a potentially fatal development in an age before antibiotics and a symptom of malaria. He was a tutor to the children who became the Roman emperors Geta and Caracalla, and his privileged position in a wealthy noble family added importance to his words. Writing in in the second century A.D. in a book called Liber Medicinalis ( Book of Medicine ), Serenus advised making an amulet containing parchment inscribed with the magical word, to be hung around the neck of a sufferer. He prescribed that the word be written on subsequent lines, but in a downwards-pointing triangle with one less letter each time, as shown in the image above.",

Described as the \"work of a master,\" its hand-poked precision appears strikingly modern even today.\n\nFurther south in Oaxaca, Mexico, the only known tattooed mummy from Mesoamerica, a Mixtec woman from 250 A.D., expands our historical understanding. Re-identified as female in 2012, her shoulder bears glyphs mentioning lightning, wind, and a specific date, suggesting her role within an elite priestess caste, perhaps tied to a weather deity. Her existence definitively proves that pre-Columbian Mesoamericans practiced elaborate tattooing, contradicting previous assumptions that Spanish accounts of \"painted bodies\" referred only to cosmetics.",

        "content": "If Edda Ciano were to rescue her husband, she would have to do what no one else dared: she would have to blackmail Adolf Hitler. Ad  F hrer,  she wrote in a letter dated 10 January 1944,  for some time the documents have been in the hands of persons who are authorised to use them in case anything should happen to my husband . She gave Hitler three days to release Galeazzo Ciano, or she would publish the Italian s private diaries. It was a gambit as unlikely as it was daring. A young German spy named Hilde Beetz had already been sent to seduce her husband and learn the location of the documents. That spy s mission had already produced results. But what Hitler could not know was that in the final months of 1943, the young spy assigned to beguile Galeazzo Ciano in a prison cell had fallen in love with her target and was, even now, helping Edda to deliver her brazen blackmail message. Why did Hitler want Galeazzo Ciano's diaries? So, who was Galeazzo Ciano, and why were his diaries of such interest to Hitler? Galeazzo Ciano had been, until the previous summer, Benito Mussolini s foreign minister and political heir-apparent. Crucially, he was also Mussolini s son-in-law. Edda Ciano, n e Edda Mussolini, was the headstrong favourite child of Il Duce. Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini in 1938, with Galeazzo Ciano seen just to Hitler s right. Germany and Italy would enter a new political and military alliance the following year, dubbed the  Pact of Steel . (Image by Getty Images) As Mussolini s foreign minister, Galeazzo Ciano had been privy to secret conversations between Germany and Italy, and by 1942, became ever more convinced that joining the Axis powers had been a grave mistake. Determined to act, he began secret negotiations with the Allies and sought to remove Italy from the war. When that failed, he reached out to Allied intelligence, attempting to broker a separate peace. After that, too, failed, he joined a plot to remove his father-in-law from power in the summer of 1943, and, for a few weeks   until Hitler liberated Mussolini from his mountain-top prison   Ciano and his co-conspirators succeeded. In the autumn of 1943, Hitler restored Mussolini to power as the head of a puppet state in northern Italy, which came to be known as the Italian Social Republic, or Sal  Republic. The Ciano family attempted to flee to South America, but were detained and sent home. Mussolini understood that he was expected to deal with his treacherous son-in-law in a show trial for treason. The verdict was always going to be  guilty . When the trial began on 8 January 1944, Galeazzo Ciano s attorney was persuaded to resign, and the public defender was comically incompetent. But it did not matter   the whole affair was nothing more than a charade. When the inevitable verdict was announced two days later, a plea for clemency was sent to Mussolini, and that night he was heard pacing sleeplessly waiting for the appeal. He had already half-decided to commute the sentence for the sake of his daughter, but the request for clemency never reached him. A senior member of Mussolini s Fascist Party, afraid that the dictator would waver, withheld the letter until Galeazzo Ciano had been executed on the morning of 11 January. Edda Ciano and Hilde Beetz did not, of course, know of those palace intrigues. All they knew during the trial was that there would only be a narrow window between the verdict and the firing squad. It might be hours; it might be a day or two. And Edda no longer believed that her father would be moved by appeals for mercy. She knew, though, what might move him: the papers. German spy Hilde Beetz, pictured here in 1953, was tasked with finding out where Galeazzo Ciano had hidden his diaries. (Image Public Domain) The  Ciano Diaries  recorded the inner workings of a fascist strategy that he now renounced, along with its ugliest diplomatic secrets. And since at least 1942, the diaries had been seriously aggravating Hitler.  I don t understand,  Hitler fumed privately,  how Mussolini can make war with a foreign minister who doesn t want it and who keeps diaries in which he says nasty things about Nazism and its leaders . The Gestapo was, even now, hunting for Edda and the missing papers. On the podcast | Judy Batalion describes how a group of young Jewish women fought back against their Nazi oppressors in occupied Poland A rescue bid Despite Hilde s feelings for Galeazzo Ciani, Edda was prepared to set emotional complications aside in a bid to save her husband s life. Aided by Edda s wartime lover, Emilio Pucci, the two women teamed up and concocted a plan to smuggle Edda and the diaries over the border to neutral Switzerland, where they would make contact with British intelligence. Before crossing the frontier, Edda wrote the aforementioned letter to Hitler, along with a letter to her father, threatening to publish the diaries unless her husband was released from prison. She handed the blackmail letters (both post-dated to 10 January) to Emilio, so he could pass them to Hilde. Hilde would then see that they reached the two dictators. Emilio gave Edda a loaded pistol and warned her to shoot anyone who tried to stop her On the evening of 9 January, Emilio gave Edda a loaded pistol, warned her to shoot anyone who tried to stop her   and to shoot herself if they captured her   and watched as she disappeared into the woods with several volumes of her husband s diaries wrapped around her waist in a belt made of pyjamas. When she arrived at the Swiss side of the border, the impression that she was heavily pregnant prevented her being searched by agents. Galeazzo Ciano (centre) pictured at the Berghof, Hitler s Bavarian chalet, in 1942. In secret, he opposed the war. (Image by Getty Images) Having seen Edda off, Emilio rushed to Verona to deliver her letters, with the intention of returning to the border to flee himself. Instead, he was captured and tortured by the Gestapo. Hilde, feeling responsible for the debacle, persuaded her supervisor that if she could take Emilio to Switzerland, he would help them  trap  Edda and get the diaries. In reality, of course, they would ensure Edda and the diaries made it safely to Britain. However, as soon as the pair arrived in Switzerland, Emilio collapsed on the street from head trauma, making their incognito operations impossible. He was then hospitalised with a fractured skull and later interned as an Italian prisoner of war. Meanwhile, Edda   a very unwelcome refugee in Switzerland   was incarcerated in a convent, with no access to outside information. She was still in possession of the diaries, and still hunted by the Gestapo. Hiding in Switzerland On 14 January, an Italian diplomat travelled to Edda s convent, where he informed her that her husband had been executed three days earlier. It was crushing news   a revelation that caused her to howl in grief and fury   but she was still keen to ensure that the diaries were published. With Hilde now undercover as a German consular secretary in Switzerland, the trio attempted to contact British intelligence to arrange the delivery of the manuscripts, and to negotiate Edda s passage to safety. Already, there were German plans in the works to kidnap her, obtain the location of the diaries, and ensure her permanent silence. Galeazzo and Edda Ciano pictured in 1935. Edda was the daughter of Benito Mussolini, under whom Galeazzo served as foreign minister between 1936 and 1943. (Image by Getty Images) Frustratingly, though, the British agent on the ground in Bern   perceiving that Hilde was a German operative and suspecting a set-up aimed at revealing his identity   could not be drawn. Things were looking bleak: Hilde was unable to renew a Swiss visa and about to be deported; Emilio was still recovering from a cracked skull; and it was only a matter of time before Hitler s henchmen discovered Edda s location. Fortunately, the trio had a lucky break. The presence of Edda and Emilio in Switzerland came to the attention of an American government man in Bern named Allen Dulles, whose covert assignment was the operation of the newly founded Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS already had some information about the diaries, and was keen to obtain them for the Allies. Not only might the documents help shape public perceptions about the war, but the Allies were already looking ahead to what would become   after the conflict had ended   the trials at Nuremberg. The race was on. A mountain mission Allen Dulles  first thought was to send in a professional intelligence agent, Cordelia Dodson, who had attended university with Emilio, to see if she could obtain the materials. He soon realised, however, that a more expedient route was available: in Fribourg there was a country house, locally known as the  House of Spies , where the American and British intelligence communities socialised, along with a select group of other European agents. The hostess, an American banker s wife named Frances de Chollet, was friends with the Italian heiress Virginia Agnelli and her daughters, who were themselves friends of Edda and Emilio. Keen to exploit this connection, Allen Dulles activated Frances as an  accidental  (amateur) agent and tasked her with befriending Edda and persuading her to trust the Americans with her late husband s papers. To facilitate the clandestine  girls  lunches  between the two women, the OSS provided Frances with a sporty race car to cross the mountain pass to the psychiatric clinic where Edda was now living in secret. It was fortunate that they did   and that Frances was an excellent and experienced race car driver. Because, when Edda ultimately did agree to allow the OSS to photograph the papers, the equipment blew the fuses inside the building.

(Image by Getty Images) Fearing that the clinic would discover what was happening   and that Edda would be sent back to Italy, and her certain death   it was decided that Frances would drive Edda and the diaries across the mountains to photograph the diaries on Frances  kitchen table. The plan worked: the intelligence team photographed the diaries, page by page, into the early morning hours. Then, just before dawn, Frances drove Edda back to the clinic at high speed and helped her sneak back in through a window. What began as an amateur spy mission ended up in a bond that would last after the war ended. Later, Edda would fondly recall  that little trip , especially how the two women dodged the Gestapo and delivered   at last   the major portion of Galeazzo Ciano s diaries to the Allies for publication, just as Edda had warned Hitler. Delivering justice On 27 May 1945, Allen Dulles held the papers in his hands; the papers that three women   Edda Ciano, Hilde Beetz and Frances de Chollet   had each risked their lives to preserve, and that bound them in a curious wartime friendship. Together, the papers were, in the words of the US government,  the most important single political document concerning recent Italian affairs in existence . In front of Dulles was Robert H Jackson, the US chief counsel and head prosecutor at the trials that would come to be known simply as Nuremberg, after their location. The charges were crimes against the peace, conspiracy, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The diaries of Galeazzo Ciano were among the most important pieces of evidence against members of Hitler s innermost circle. Whatever small measure of justice Nuremberg amounted to, set against the sweeping depravity of World War II, these women   in what must rank as one of the war s greatest rescue missions   helped to deliver one part of it to history. Dr Tilar J Mazzeo is a bestselling author and an associate professor at the Universit  de Montr al.

        "target_summary": "In a captivating tale of wartime intrigue and desperate courage, Edda Ciano, the headstrong daughter of Benito Mussolini, embarked on a perilous mission to save her condemned husband, Galeazzo Ciano. Facing his imminent execution for treason, Edda launched a daring gambit, threatening Adolf Hitler himself with the explosive private diaries her husband had meticulously kept. She gave the Führer mere days to release Ciano, or the damning secrets within the diaries—chronicling the inner workings of fascist strategy and its darkest diplomatic dealings—would be exposed to the world.\n\nGaleazzo Ciano, once Mussolini's foreign minister and heir-apparent, had become disillusioned with the Axis powers, secretly attempting to broker peace with the Allies and even joining a plot to depose his father-in-law. Although briefly successful, Hitler restored Mussolini to power, leading to Ciano's arrest and a farcical show trial. Despite Edda's desperate pleas and a last-minute clemency request that was maliciously withheld, Ciano was executed by firing squad.\n\nUndeterred by his death, Edda vowed to honor his memory by ensuring his diaries saw the light of day. Her audacious plan involved an unlikely network of allies: her lover, Emilio Pucci, and, remarkably, a German spy named Hilde Beetz. Beetz, originally tasked by Hitler to seduce Ciano and locate the very diaries Edda now guarded, had instead fallen in love with her target and chose to betray her mission, secretly aiding Edda. Together, they concocted a plan to smuggle Edda and the precious documents across the border to neutral Switzerland. With the diaries wrapped around her waist, Edda made a harrowing escape, narrowly evading capture.\n\nOnce in Switzerland, grief-stricken but resolute, Edda found herself incarcerated, still hunted by the Gestapo.

The critical intelligence contained within Ciano's diaries soon caught the attention of Allen Dulles, an astute American operative with the newly formed Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA. Dulles immediately recognized their immense value, not only for shaping wartime perceptions but also as crucial evidence for the looming Nuremberg trials.\n\nWith British agents proving wary, Dulles activated Frances de Chollet, an American banker's wife and \"accidental agent,\" to befriend Edda. Frances, a skilled race car driver, masterminded a clandestine operation, driving Edda and the diaries across mountain passes to photograph the manuscripts page by page in secret.

        "title": "Wrens at war: life in the Women's Royal Naval Service in WW2",
        "content": "When the air raid siren began to blare, everyone on the third floor ran for the basement   except for 19-year-old Vera Jahans, the naval switchboard operator, who was ordered to stay at her post. She was told to wear her tin hat, and,  if it got very noisy, to get under the board for a bit . After the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, switchboards like hers were in operation 24 hours a day, coordinating the movement of troops and supplies. Vera was just one of more than 75,000 women who served in the Women s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) during the Second World War, undertaking vital   and sometimes dangerous   work. Ad The WRNS had first been established in 1917 during the First World War, when around 6,000  Wrens  took on predominantly administrative and domestic jobs in the Royal Navy to release men for frontline duty. Disbanded in peacetime, it was reformed in April 1939, when war again became inevitable. Dame Vera Laughton Mathews, who had spent two years with the WRNS during the first war, was appointed as its new director. In the Second World War, the only way for women to undertake military duties was to join one of the three auxiliary services that provided supporting staff for the armed forces. Alongside the WRNS was the Army s Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS), and the Women s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). The WRNS quickly became the most popular. As the smallest of the women s services, entry into the WRNS was naturally more competitive.  | An army of women: adventures in the Auxiliary Territorial Service Like many women, 18-year-old Barbara Smoker was anxious about factory work  because I d feel I was making things that would kill people and wound people, and this seemed to me such an awful thing . She thought that in the services, she would be less directly involved in killing the enemy and so volunteered before she risked being called up for factory work. The WRNS also offered women more opportunities for skilled specialist work in addition to general domestic roles. What was WRNS training like? Newspaper adverts and recruitment posters depicted a smart woman in uniform calling for volunteers to  Join the Wrens   and Free a Man for the Fleet . Paulina Nichol, who served as a WRNS meteorologist, recalls wearing  a straight blue serge skirt, black stockings, dark blue bloomers (a fleecy material) and a jacket which... fitted pretty well if you were lucky.  And, unlike the women of the ATS, most Wrens were volunteers rather than conscripts. With thousands of applications every time new positions opened, the WRNS was seen as the most exclusive of the auxiliaries, and the recruiting officers were able to take their pick of the best candidates. But when women were called up, they were in for a shock. Each one had to earn her place   and her uniform. The women first reported as probationers to Mill Hill, London, for two weeks  basic training. Dressed in overalls, there was none of the promised glamour. According to 19-year-old Eileen Drury, the whole affair was  designed to put us off... it was perfectly dreadful, nearly killed us!  Lectured on naval traditions, the women were taught to drill, and any romantic notions of crewing sailboats were quickly dismissed. Josephine Pearce says,  I remember spending most of the fortnight scrubbing rough bare concrete floors... cleaning, cleaning, cleaning and more cleaning.

The recruiters were seeking resilient women who weren t afraid of hard work or being shouted at by their superiors. Instead of joining an exclusive club based on social class or wealth, Wrens were selected based on their skills and experience. The director, Vera Laughton Mathews, insisted that, apart from the initial appointments in 1939 when the WRNS was being established, all officers should be appointed from the ranks. After basic training, the women were interviewed. If they were accepted, they were given a chance to choose their role and finally receive their uniforms. Initially, the navy only wanted women for domestic and clerical duties, but even before the war began, they asked Wrens to take on coding and cypher work. To keep communications secret, a coder would encrypt messages to be sent between ships and bases by substituting the text with pre-agreed words and phrases.  | Female codebreakers: the women of Bletchley Park However, a Cypher Wren dealt with more confidential material, substituting each letter using a more complex system. Enid Bruce began working as a Wren coder in her home city of Newcastle at the end of 1939. Then, in May 1943, she became a cypher officer on board a troop ship. Wrens were not permitted to serve on large Royal Navy vessels. As well as maintaining its ban on women in combat positions, the navy argued that it must ensure propriety   there were no separate female quarters on board. Yet troop ships like Queen Elizabeth, which Enid worked on, had been converted from luxury liners, so accommodation was not an issue. In total, approximately 30 Wrens worked on troop ships and handled sensitive information, including messages bound for the Allied leaders  conferences in Quebec and Tehran. While the British worked hard to protect their own communications, they were simultaneously trying to break the enemy s codes. Eileen Drury was offered a role so secret that she wasn t allowed to tell anyone about it   not even her parents. If anyone asked, she was doing clerical work. Reporting to a top-secret building in Stanmore, London, Eileen joined a small group of Wrens in charge of Britain s first computers, a series of machines called Bombes. On the podcast | Kathy Kleiman reveals how six women helped create the world s first modern computer Built by the country s top codebreakers at Bletchley Park, the Bombes were set up by the Wrens according to precise instructions, and they waited for hours as they processed thousands of combinations, aiming to crack the German naval codes. Allied convoys transporting troops and valuable supplies were at the mercy of Germany s submarines, the U-boats. If Bletchley could break a code in time, the convoys could be warned in advance of the enemy s plans. When the Bombe suddenly stopped, the Wren noted the position of the dials, and the information was sent back to the team at Bletchley. Eileen says the Wrens were under  a lot of pressure to be quick and terribly accurate and not to make mistakes... we knew if we were quick and could get the message up quickly, we could save a lot of lives . Eileen later volunteered for service abroad, spending two years working for South East Asia Command in Colombo, Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka), dealing with Japanese codes. Wrens first went overseas in 1941, and by the end of the war they had served in Ceylon, Egypt, Kenya, Singapore, Iraq, South Africa, the United States and Northern Europe. They supported the Royal Navy across the globe. A Wren (member of the Women's Royal Naval Service) changes a tyre at the HMS Daedalus shore establishment in Hampshire, 1941 (Photo by Horace Abrahams/ Keystone Features/ Hulton Archive/ Getty Images) How did the WRNS change during the war? While the majority of women were still employed in domestic roles (such as cooking and cleaning) by 1941, the number of jobs available to women increased significantly. For instance, all naval despatch riders were Wrens, delivering messages by motorbike, and they also began crewing small craft within the navy s harbours. As meteorologists, their forecasts informed the navy and its air force, the Fleet Air Arm, ahead of manoeuvres. In the months leading up to D-Day, the Wrens helped build up knowledge of how weather systems behaved across the Channel and the impact these could have on the operation. From parachute packers to radar plotters, the list of jobs kept growing. New technologies such as radar required more people on the ground to install and maintain equipment, leading to a growth in mechanical roles. Female conscription was introduced in December 1941, and over the next year WRNS membership doubled from 10,653 to 22,898, peaking at 74,635 in 1944. Wrens put together the practice bombs for pilot training, which contained a bright orange dye to show whether or not they had hit their target. The dye stained the Wrens  hands, and their overalls were forever covered in oil from the guns In her admission interview, Louise Taylor requested to do  something out of doors . With a grasp of physics and  strong wrists , Louise undertook six months  training as an ordnance mechanic. She learnt to strip down different guns and name all the separate parts   one gun she worked with, she recalled, had over 365 parts   before putting them back together again. Once qualified, Louise was posted to Scotland with the Fleet Air Arm. Her job was to maintain and clean the guns (including those fitted in aircraft) and then test them to make sure that they were all in working order. Louise and the other Wrens also put together the practice bombs for pilot training, which contained a bright orange dye to show whether or not they had hit their target. The dye stained the Wrens  hands, and their overalls were forever covered in oil from the guns. Carrying around heavy wooden tool boxes was hard work. There were meant to be weight limits on what women could lift and carry, but nobody ever checked. In due course, Louise was placed in charge of the explosives compound, checking the inventory and safety of the site   a major responsibility.  | The women and children of munitions factories in WW1 Were the Wrens ever in combat roles? Women were still not permitted in combat roles, but sometimes the boundaries became unclear   particularly during Operation Outward. From 1942 until the Allies landed in Normandy, Wrens were employed in a secret scheme in the coastal town of Felixstowe, Suffolk. Inflating large balloons measuring about 8 feet in diameter, the Wrens then attached either a long trailing wire or an incendiary device to the end. When the wind blew in the right direction, these balloons drifted across the Channel to German-occupied Europe. The aim was to cause a major nuisance; for the wires to bring down telephone lines, and for the incendiaries to set fire to crops and buildings (one balloon even caused a blaze that destroyed a power station). Unusually, these Wrens were also trained to fire Lewis guns and rifles in case they came under attack. When the wind was blowing the wrong way, the Wrens spent their time making grommets: circles of interlaced wire that were hung across harbour entrances to prevent submarines entering. In total, Operation Outward employed seven Wren officers and 140 Wrens, and they successfully launched over 99,000 balloons. The Wrens also played a crucial part in implementing radar; a major innovation championed by the British armed forces during the war. Wren radio mechanics were trained to install radar units in aircraft and boats and to fix them quickly if anything went wrong. Radar used radio waves to ascertain the location of other vessels and aircraft. This information was then relayed to operation rooms, where Wrens received details of the locations and plotted them on a grid, providing commanding officers with a three-dimensional view of the situation. On the podcast | Tessa Dunlop explores the lives of the last surviving women who served in Britain s armed forces during WW2 Former Wrens recall looking at the grid on D-Day and trying to keep track of the hundreds of ships crossing the Channel. Thelma Stollar trained for nine months as a radio mechanic, and in March 1944 she reported to HMS Collingwood to help set up a radar training school. Their male commanding officer  was utterly appalled to see us and said that it was absolutely useless to have Wrens... he was furious.  He told the women they would have to run cables, fix generators and mix cement; not women s work. To which, Thelma said, the Wrens replied:  Oh, we can do that!  According to her, they always said,  we can do that . Over the course of the war, the women of the WRNS adapted to new roles, taking on more responsibilities and facing new challenges. Such was the vital contribution of the Wrens that in 1949 the service was made permanent, before eventually being integrated into the Royal Navy in 1993. Ad Elisabeth Shipton is a military historian, television and radio documentary researcher, and author. Her books include Female Tommies: The Frontline Women of the First World War (The History Press, 2014)",
        "target_summary": "During the Second World War, the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), reformed in 1939 and led by Dame Vera Laughton Mathews, emerged as the most sought-after and competitive of Britain's women's auxiliary services. By 1944, over 75,000 dedicated \"Wrens\" performed a vast array of vital, often perilous, duties, coordinating military movements and sustaining the war effort. Young women like 19-year-old naval switchboard operator Vera Jahans exemplified this commitment, remaining at their posts even during air raids to ensure continuous communication for crucial operations like the D-Day invasion. Many joined the WRNS to find skilled, purposeful work, eschewing factory labor.\n\nRecruitment posters alluringly promised smart uniforms and purposeful service, but the reality of basic training at Mill Hill was a shock. Probationers faced rigorous drills, lectures on naval traditions, and relentless cleaning, designed to test their resilience before they could earn their uniforms. Initially assigned to domestic and clerical tasks, the roles of Wrens rapidly diversified and expanded. They became indispensable coders and cypher officers, with figures like Enid Bruce handling highly confidential messages on troop ships. Others, like Eileen Drury, undertook top-secret work operating complex Bombe machines at Stanmore, tirelessly cracking German naval codes to safeguard Allied convoys and save countless lives. Wrens served across the globe, from Ceylon to North Africa, supporting the Royal Navy's vast operations.\n\nAs the war progressed, Wrens pushed the boundaries of traditional women's roles, taking on specialized and physically demanding tasks. They served as dispatch riders, small craft crews, and critical meteorologists whose forecasts shaped D-Day planning. They became radar plotters, assembling practice bombs (which indelibly stained their hands), and even ordnance mechanics like Louise Taylor, who meticulously maintained aircraft guns and managed explosives compounds. Though officially barred from combat, some Wrens in \"Operation Outward\" launched incendiary and wire-laden balloons across the Channel into enemy territory, and were even trained to fire firearms. Others, defying initial male skepticism, became pioneering radar mechanics and plotters, installing equipment and providing crucial three-dimensional intelligence on the battlefield. The Wrens' unwavering adaptability, skill, and sheer grit proved their \"vital contribution\" to Allied victory, leading to the service's permanent establishment in 1949 and its eventual full integration into the Royal Navy in 1993.",

Read on for your guide to ancient Rome  Ad Q: Who founded ancient Rome? A: Like all ancient societies, the Romans possessed a heroic foundation story. What made the Romans different, however, is that they created two distinct creation myths for themselves. In the first it was claimed that they were descended from the royal Trojan refugee Aeneas (himself the son of the goddess Venus). In the second it was stated that the city of Rome was founded by, and ultimately named after, Romulus, son of a union between an earthly princess and the god Mars. Both myths helped establish the Romans as a divinely chosen people whose ancestry could be traced back to Troy and the Hellenistic world. Roman tradition had Romulus  foundling city established on the Palatine Hill in what became, for Rome,  Year One  (or 753 BC in the Christian calendar of the West).

(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The Romulus and Remus story tells of two babies, royal twins ousted by their great-uncle, found and suckled by a wolf then brought up by an honest shepherd. As men, they returned to found the city of Rome   and then Romulus murdered his brother. How Romans saw this story tells us a great deal about the way they perceived themselves, says Mary Beard when talking about the Roman republic. Civil war and fratricide were embedded in their history; they were never going to escape civil war because right at the very beginning   the first moment in Roman history   a brother killed a brother.

A: Rome made much of the fact that it was a republic, ruled by the people and not by kings. Rome had overthrown its monarchy in 509 BC, and legislative power was thereafter vested in the people s assemblies: political power in the senate, and military power with two annually elected magistrates known as consuls.

Even after the rise of the Roman emperors   kings in all but name, who  guided  the Roman political system in the 1st century AD    SPQR  continued to be used in order to sustain the fiction that Rome was a state governed by purely republican principles. Answered by Miles Russell Q: What was the senate in ancient Rome? A: Under the Roman republican constitution, the monarchy was abolished, but the king s former advisory council of elders survived in the form of the senate (senex being Latin for  old man ). Originally comprising the heads of each leading family in Rome, the senate became the key component in Roman politics, with responsibilities in finance and expenditure, foreign policy, the appointment of provincial governors, and military strategy, although legislative power was ultimately vested in the various people s assemblies. In order that decisive action could be taken in the field of domestic politics, the senate was guided by two annually elected consuls of equal authority, who, for the duration of their posts, possessed supreme power. Consuls needed to be in agreement if action could be taken, and each could veto the decisions of the other. In times of extreme emergency, a dictator (who  spoke  for the people), was appointed to deal with the crisis. Answered by Miles Russell Q: What was life like in ancient Rome? A: Most wealthy Romans were able to afford both a town house (domus) and an out of town rural retreat (villa). The best town houses possessed private spaces for family use, grouped around and facing an internal courtyard or garden. They also featured public rooms for the receiving of business visitors, clients and official guests.  | Did Romans really wear togas? The more well-to-do possessed dining rooms for winter and summer use, featuring brightly coloured wall plaster often depicting scenes from Roman mythology. Their homes boasted multiple bedrooms, separate kitchens, underfloor heating and decorative mosaics.

(Image by Getty Images) The less well-off city dwellers lived simply in either rooms above their shop or place of employment, or rented flats in crowded and less well-built apartment blocks of varying design and scale   sometimes seven or eight storeys high. Slaves were usually accommodated within discrete areas of wealthy family homes. There were also insulae, the forerunner of modern apartment buildings. Each insula consisted of around half a dozen living spaces for Rome s middle class and poorer citizens, the plebs, as well as shops and businesses on the ground floor. What was life like in Roman Britain? We know much about life in the ancient Roman period due to archaeological sites including the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, which was lost for centuries, after the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79.

A: As for food in ancient Rome, the Romans ate pretty much everything they could lay their hands on. Meat, especially pork and fish, however, were expensive commodities, and so the bulk of the population survived on cereals (wheat, emmer and barley) mixed with chickpeas, lentils, turnips, lettuce, leek, cabbage and fenugreek. Olives, grapes, apples, plums and figs provided welcome relief from the traditional forms of thick, cereal-based porridge (tomatoes and potatoes were a much later introduction to the Mediterranean), while milk, cheese, eggs and bread were also daily staples.  | Meet the people the ancient Romans tried to hide The Romans liked to vary their cooking with sweet (honey) and sour (fermented fish) sauces, which often helpfully disguised the taste of rotten meat. Dining as entertainment was practised within elite society   lavish dinner parties were the ideal way to show off wealth and status. Recipes compiled in the 4th century supply us with details of tasty treats such as pickled sow s udders and stuffed dormice. Answered by Miles Russell Q: Who were gladiators in ancient Rome? A: Gladiatorial games were organised by the elite throughout the Roman empire in order to distract the population from the reality of daily life. Most gladiators were purchased from slave markets, being chosen for their strength, stamina and good looks. Although taken from the lowest elements of society, the gladiator was a breed apart from the  normal  slave or prisoner of war, being well-trained combatants whose one role in life was to fight and occasionally to kill for the amusement of the Roman mob. A relief portraying a Gladiator fight. (Photo By DEA / A. DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini/Getty Images) Whatever their reasons for ending up in the arena, gladiators were adored by the Roman public for their bravery and spirit. Their images appeared frequently in mosaics, wall paintings and on glassware and pottery. Answered by Miles Russell Q: Why did the Romans build straight roads? A: While some Roman roads might have bends or corners, the vast majority are distinctively straight as they march for mile after mile across Britain and Europe. Unlike modern roads, the via munita were not intended for the use of ordinary people. Only army units, government officials and those with a special pass were allowed to use them. When moving armies, or officials to deal with emergencies, speed was paramount. Everyone else had to make do with using local dirt tracks. An old Roman road in Sardinia, Italy. (Photo by Getty Images) Of course, you would think certain natural features   steep hills and valleys   of the landscape could affect the straightness of the via munita. Not so, Roman roads went straight up the most precipitous of slopes without winding back and forth in hairpin bends like modern roads. This is because a marching man on foot can go straight up a steep hill and then rest to recover before moving on much quicker than if he wound around a gently rising slope. Army supplies were carried on mules who could likewise go up a steep slope without much trouble. Draught animals pulling wagons needed the gentler slope, but the via munita were not built for merchants who used wagons. Answered by Rupert Matthews The Romans get the credit for a lot of inventions, but things are more complicated than that. Historian Jem Duducu investigates what the Romans really did for us  Q: Why did ancient Rome fall? A: A whole variety of reasons can be suggested to explain the fall of the Roman empire in the west: disease, invasion, civil war, social unrest, inflation, economic collapse. In fact all were contributory factors, although key to the collapse of Roman authority was the prolonged period of imperial in-fighting during the 3rd and 4th century.  about the fall of Rome Conflict between multiple emperors severely weakened the military, eroded the economy and put a huge strain upon local populations. When Germanic migrants arrived, many western landowners threw their support behind the new  barbarian  elite rather than continuing to back the emperor. Reduced income from the provinces meant that Rome could no longer pay or feed its military and civil administration, making the imperial system of government redundant. The western half of the Roman empire mutated into a variety of discrete kingdoms while the east, which largely avoided both the in-fighting and barbarian migrations, survived until the 15th century.

Both are completely anachronistic: the Romans, like the Greeks, had an ideology that we call  civic militarism . It was believed that if you were a citizen you had a duty to fight for your state, and conversely if you fought you were entitled to political rights. This excluded the use of slave rowers, or slave soldiers like those of medieval Islam. In the handful of exceptional times when slaves were admitted to the armed forces, they were either freed before enlistment, or promised manumission if they performed well in battle.

        "target_summary": "Ancient Rome, a civilization etched into history, is celebrated for its vast conquests, ingenious innovations like underfloor heating, and expansive road networks. Yet, the true fabric of Roman society reveals a complex tapestry of divine origin, political evolution, daily life, and eventual decline.\n\nThe Romans wove two heroic foundation myths for themselves, asserting their status as a divinely chosen people. One lineage traced back to the Trojan refugee Aeneas, son of the goddess Venus. The other, more visceral tale, recounted the legendary founding of Rome in 753 BC by Romulus, born from a union between an earthly princess and the god Mars. This latter myth, involving the fraternal murder of Remus by Romulus, symbolically embedded civil strife and fratricide into Rome's very genesis, a recurring theme throughout its history, despite archaeological evidence of settlement predating these legends by centuries.\n\nRome’s political journey began with the overthrow of monarchy in 509 BC, giving rise to the Republic. Legislative power resided with the people’s assemblies, political power with the esteemed Senate, and military authority with two annually elected Consuls. The proud acronym \"SPQR\" (Senatus Populusque Romanus – the Senate and People of Rome) emblazoned across their empire, underscored the theoretical primacy of its citizens. However, by the late 1st century BC, ambitious politicians and extensive overseas territories strained this system, ushering in emperors who, while ruling as kings, maintained the republican fiction to sustain public belief. The Senate, initially an advisory council of elders, became a pivotal institution, wielding influence over finance, foreign policy, and military strategy, guided by the Consuls and, in dire emergencies, by a temporary Dictator.\n\nDaily life showcased stark contrasts. The wealthy luxuriated in multi-roomed townhouses (domus) and country villas, boasting internal courtyards, underfloor heating, and vibrant mythological frescoes. The less affluent city dwellers, however, occupied cramped rooms above shops or rented flats in towering, often poorly built apartment blocks (insulae), sometimes seven or eight stories high, in a society rife with class hatred and exploitation. The meticulously preserved city of Pompeii offers an intimate glimpse into these everyday realities.\n\nRoman cuisine, driven by accessibility, saw the general populace subsisting on cereals, lentils, and vegetables, supplemented by fruits, dairy, eggs, and bread. Expensive meats and fish were luxuries. Elite dining, however, transformed into lavish entertainment, a display of wealth featuring rich sweet and sour sauces (often masking less-than-fresh meat) and exotic delicacies like pickled sow's udders and stuffed dormice.\n\nFor public amusement, gladiatorial games served as a grand distraction from daily hardships. Most gladiators were enslaved men, chosen for their strength and appearance, then rigorously trained. Though drawn from society's lowest strata, these combatants were revered by the Roman public for their bravery and spirit, their images frequently adorning mosaics and pottery.\n\nThe famed Roman roads, or \"via munita,\" were not built for common folk or merchants, but were distinctively straight and robust, primarily designed for the rapid movement of armies and officials. They conquered steep inclines directly, without winding, to facilitate swift passage for foot soldiers and mules, for whom speed over gentle gradients was paramount.\n\nThe eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 410 was not due to a single catastrophe but a confluence of factors: disease, relentless invasions, devastating civil wars, social unrest, inflation, and economic collapse. Prolonged imperial infighting in the 3rd and 4th centuries severely weakened the military and economy. As Germanic migrants arrived, many Western landowners shifted allegiance from the struggling emperor to the new \"barbarian\" elites. A dwindling income from the provinces ultimately rendered the imperial system unsustainable, causing the West to fragment into discrete kingdoms, while the Eastern Roman Empire remarkably endured for another thousand years.\n\nDespite common misconceptions, Roman warships were not propelled by chained slaves but by free citizens, reflecting a principle of \"civic militarism\" where fighting for the state bestowed political rights. Furthermore, while the average life expectancy was around 25 due to high infant mortality and childbirth risks, Romans who survived childhood often lived into old age, comparable to lifespans in the modern Western world.",

Archaeologists still point to those distinctive stacks of bricks beneath villa floors as a mark of Roman sophistication.  The hypocaust system is really important for us to think about when we consider Roman homes,  explains Dr Hannah Platts on the HistoryExtra podcast.  It was important to them: that it heated their baths and their other spaces.  But they weren t for everyone. Who owned homes with underfloor heating? And what did such comfort say about status and power?  I should reiterate, having your own bathhouse or having a hypocaust was a luxury,  says Platts. Rome s underfloor miracle At its simplest, a hypocaust worked by circulating hot air through a hollow space beneath the floor. A furnace, or praefurnium, was stoked outside the building; hot air from the furnace was funnelled into a network of small brick pillars (pilae) that supported a raised floor. But it wasn t just about heating the floor.  | How and why did the Roman empire fall?  The hypocaust was used to heat houses via underfloor heating, but actually we ve got a number of houses where we ve got evidence of box flue tiles in the walls,  says Platts.  So we know that hypocausts could heat the walls of the rooms as well.  In the context of ancient Rome this was engineering of incredible sophistication. Archaeological remains from sites such as Pompeii and Ostia, and across Roman Britain, show entire suites of rooms heated by the system. Stepping barefoot on a mosaic floor, warmed from underneath, was quite literally to step upon Roman ingenuity. The Roman baths at Salamis, dating to the 3rd century, feature a well-preserved hypocaust system beneath the tepidarium, or warm room. This network of brick pillars once channelled hot air under and through the floors. (Photo by Getty Images) From the baths to the villa The hypocaust began as a public luxury, eventually exported to private homes. The earliest examples appeared in the great bath complexes (thermae) of the late republic and early empire. Roman baths were vast public leisure centres and required consistent, large-scale heating. The first recorded Roman hypocausts date to the first century BC, developed under architects and engineers serving figures such as Marcus Agrippa, the ally and later son-in-law of the Roman emperor Augustus. Under Augustus himself, public bathhouses multiplied across Rome and its provinces. The technique soon spread to private villas, where the wealthy adapted public comfort for domestic display. By the second century AD, during the reigns of emperors such as Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, the hypocaust had become a standard feature of elite architecture across the empire   from the Mediterranean heartlands to the frontier forts of Britain. The price of luxury But this warmth came at a cost.  We know that the idea of heating your house was really important, but it wasn t for everyone,  says Platts.  To have a hypocaust system in one s house was a big sign of wealth. It would generally only have been present in examples of really opulent and wealthy dwellings: dwellings that, for example, might have their own private bathhouses.  They didn t even need to go to the general baths. They could just have fun in their own spaces.  And, Platts says, what often goes forgotten is that maintaining heat from a hypocaust was hard.  | Everything you wanted to know about the Roman emperors  It took significant effort to build [and] to maintain,  says Platts. Fires had to be constantly fed with wood, ash cleared away and airways cleaned.  There s engineering skill behind it too,  says Platts.  Not everyone is going to be able to build a hypocaust. There is a huge amount of skill behind that building process, and then you ve actually got to be able to run the hypocaust and have it working. It really would ve taken considerable finances to build a hypocaust within your house.  The result was that the hypocaust became an unmistakable badge of wealth. Visitors entering a villa with warm floors knew instantly that they stood in the home of someone of status.

For the upper classes, architecture, fashion, and food all worked together to display wealth and taste.  What also would be luxuries could be the way in which people spent their fortunes in other ways,  Platts says.  I m thinking about fashionable clothing, or elaborate jewellery or gemstones. Romans loved amber. They loved pearls. They had quite a thing for uncut diamonds   as we all might   and things that were imported: ivory imported from Africa, silks imported from towards China.  The global reach of the Roman empire fed its appetite for exotic goods. To own these luxuries, to eat peppered dishes and dress in silk, was to embody the luxuries of empire.  Anything like fine wines, exotic spices, was a really good way of showing your status,  Platts notes. In this way, food became another way to demonstrate power.

Furthermore, luxury in Rome was intrinsically linked to labor, with the number, origin, and skills of enslaved people also serving as potent indicators of an owner's prosperity.

However, the oldest-known versions of the list start with a landmark that is often forgotten: the Temple of Artemis. Ad Located in the ancient city of Ephesus (near modern-day Sel uk, Turkey), this remarkable place of worship was renowned for its size and scale, standing at least 20 metres tall and boasting an enormous tile-covered roof supported by 127 marble columns. With a floor plan of some 6,000 square metres, the temple was also nearly three times as large as the famous Parthenon in Athens. But some of the most startling archaeological evidence from Ephesus isn t concerned with the dimensions of the temple, nor its complicated history of destruction and rebuilding. Instead, much attention has been directed towards a collection of statues depicting the temple s patron deity, Artemis. A 20th-century depiction of the Temple of Artemis, dedicated to the goddess Artemis (Image by Bridgeman Images) Rather than portraying the goddess as a conventional Greek beauty, the sculptures display Artemis in an altogether different guise.

[This] is not the Artemis that you probably have in your heads  this image of a beautiful young woman in a tiny Greek chiton, artfully pulling a bow and arrow,  reveals Hughes on an episode of the HistoryExtra podcast.  She is a huge, towering figure, covered in birds and bees, goats and curious figures. But what none of you will miss  is that she looks as though she has 30 or so breasts.  Thirty breasts  or testicles? What need did Artemis have for 30 breasts? As well as being the goddess of hunting and the moon, Artemis was also revered as a deity of fertility and childbirth. Having a multitude of breasts would therefore be a fitting attribute for a goddess so intrinsically connected with fecundity and womanhood. In fact, even alternative theories   which suggest that the  breasts  are actually bulls  testicles or sacks of honey   bolster Artemis s association with abundance. Both motifs have also been used as symbols of procreation in Greek art, so the ambiguity was likely deliberate.  These ancient craftsmen are likely playing a game with us,  says Hughes. Ultimately, the ancient Greeks believed that Artemis was so potent in her fertility that  she didn t need anything as mundane as sex to procreate .

Artemis is an enduring symbol of fertility (Image by Alamy) A goddess of power and procreation It s not just the features on the statue[s] itself that suggest Artemis s importance   the location where they were discovered is notable too. Ephesus was situated on the eastern edge of the ancient Greek world, where Artemis s association with fertility and childbirth was perhaps stronger than elsewhere.  | Wanderlust: Bettany Hughes on the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World  The Artemis who was worshipped in Ephesus was an  eastern Artemis    a direct descendant of the great nature goddesses of the eastern world,  says Hughes.  Any ancient traveller who went to visit the temple would have been left in no doubts of how extremely strong and potent she was.  While Artemis was regarded as a powerful goddess for all, she was particularly important to women. Care of the temple was entrusted to high priestesses, a system that Hughes likens to a  hive buzzing around, serving the queen bee . Overall, maleness was not well tolerated at the site; it was intended to be devoted to female presence and power. An offer of sanctuary But it wasn t just the high priestesses who devoted themselves to Artemis. Countless ordinary women also dedicated themselves to this bastion of fertility, travelling from far and wide to give offerings.  Poor female pilgrims would beat a path to Artemis s door, and some of them would leave extraordinary gifts [and] beautiful gold offerings,  says Hughes.  They were left as temple dedications and then buried as hoards.  In some cases, the poorest pilgrims would simply leave a seashell for Artemis instead. They merely offered whatever they could, in the hope that the goddess would provide protection and preparation for marriage and childbirth. Crucially, the Temple of Artemis wasn t solely a place for worship   it also functioned as a place of refuge for the oppressed. Hughes adds,  If you were being persecuted politically, and even if you were a woman escaping domestic abuse, you could go to sanctuary at the temple.   | The gods and their whims: your guide to ancient Greek religion A round-mouthed jug and an assortment of Electrum coins, discovered in the foundations of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (Image by TopFoto) A forgotten legacy The Temple of Artemis was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World for good reason. Its sheer scale and beauty were matched only by the power of the goddess it honoured. To the modern eye, her many breasts might seem slightly mystifying. But   whether seen as symbols of fertility, abundance or simply a playful riddle set by ancient craftsmen   they remind us of the complexity and depth of her worship.

Located near modern-day Selçuk, Turkey, this monumental sanctuary dwarfed even the Parthenon, soaring at least 20 metres high with a sprawling 6,000-square-metre floor plan supported by an impressive 127 marble columns.\n\nBeyond its magnificent architecture, the temple was renowned for its unique depictions of the goddess Artemis, strikingly different from conventional Greek portrayals. These statues presented Artemis not as a demure huntress, but as a towering, formidable figure adorned with birds, bees, and goats, most notably featuring \"30 or so breasts.\" As classicist Bettany Hughes explains, this enigmatic characteristic—whether literal breasts, bulls' testicles, or sacks of honey—profoundly underscored Artemis's role as a potent deity of fertility, abundance, and childbirth, embodying an \"eastern Artemis\" whose creative power was believed to transcend the need for physical procreation.\n\nThe temple served as a vibrant center of female devotion and empowerment. Run by high priestesses and largely exclusive of male presence, it attracted countless women seeking the goddess's protection for marriage and childbirth, offering gifts ranging from precious gold to simple seashells. Crucially, it also functioned as a sanctuary, providing refuge for those fleeing political persecution or domestic abuse.\n\nUltimately, the Temple of Artemis captivated the ancient world with its grand dimensions, exquisite artistry, and the formidable power of its patron goddess.

        "title": "Ancient Roman theatre was a powerful weapon of empire, so why were actors' lives so tragic?",
        "content": "Roman society was acutely hierarchical. Every occupation carried a moral weight, and the line between dignity and dishonour was a stark one. A senator who spoke in the law courts could win eternal repute, but a gladiator who risked his life to entertain the masses was branded socially devalued, and the same was true of actors. Ad No matter how dazzling their performances in front of a packed theatre might be, their profession consigned them to the lowest rungs of society. By law they were infamis; people of ill repute, stripped of civic rights and grouped alongside the enslaved. But what was this paradoxical life of stardom and shame really like for the actors of the Roman empire? Roman theatre s golden age under Augustus  When we talk about a golden age of Roman theatre, we tend to be talking about Emperor Augustus s reign and the beginning of the Roman empire,  says Jessica Clarke, author of A New History of Ancient Roman Theatre, speaking on the HistoryExtra podcast.  This was a period with new cultural, religious and political structures being implemented.  Augustus was the first emperor of Rome, ruling from 27 BC until AD 14. And he grasped how useful theatre could be as a political tool.  | The worst Roman emperors Spectacle was part of a strategy that Romans would come to call panem et circenses, or bread and circuses: free food and entertainment offered to the populace in return for loyalty and social cohesion. Drama and performance helped bind audiences into a shared Roman identity and provided a stage (quite literally) for imperial ideology. This 1st-century AD mosaic from the House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii depicts the staging of a theatrical performance. Such scenes highlight the importance of theatre in Roman cultural life, blending entertainment with expressions of myth, satire, and social commentary. (Photo by Getty Images) A web of theatres across the Roman empire  Augustus built hundreds of theatres across the Roman empire, all following the design of the theatre that he also built for himself in Rome,  Clarke explains.  These theatres are enormous, they re spread across all of the provinces. Essentially, what he built was a web of entertainment venues that Rome was in charge of.  These theatres were architectural marvels in themselves. The Theatre of Marcellus in Rome, inaugurated by Augustus in 13 BC and named after his nephew, could seat more than 10,000 people. Its semicircular rows of stone seating rose above a wide orchestra space and a stage backed by the towering scaenae frons; a richly decorated permanent backdrop of columns, niches and statues. Men and women alike could attend the performances at this new wave of theatres, (unlike in Greece, where women were mostly banned from attending) and seating was arranged by social rank, with senators and equestrians   members of the second-highest social class   in prime positions, and the poor higher up. Performances ranged from solemn tragedies to ribald comedies, farcical mimes and elaborate pantomimes accompanied by music and dance. Admission was usually free, funded by magistrates or emperors seeking popularity. Who performed and who was excluded The Roman stage, however, was overwhelmingly male. As in Greece, women were largely banned from treading the boards. Clarke points to the existence of scant evidence of female performers in mime and pantomime   forms considered lower status and more risqu    but official theatre roles were reserved for men.  It s quite similar to Shakespearean rules around who is allowed to step onto a stage,  says Clarke.  Though it would have been slightly easier for men to play the female roles because they had masks on.  Masks, made of linen and plaster or occasionally wood, were central to performance, and not just because they made it easier for men to portray women; they exaggerated expressions and amplified voices too.

Listen to all episodes now On the Ides of March 44 BC, the most famous Roman in history was murdered. Julius Caesar's assassination transformed Rome forever, and the image of his bloody toga has haunted monarchs and tyrants ever since. Actors as infamis No amount of training or talent could lift an actor out of the social stigma that came with the role.  In ancient Rome, acting was an incredibly lowly profession,  says Clarke.  It wasn t something that was seen as an acceptable job for a Roman citizen to undertake. An actor was in the class known as infamis.  This was the same class as a slave; the same class as a prostitute. You would have no voting rights, and you also don t have bodily autonomy, so you don t have legal rights over your body,  Clarke explains. Why this disdain? Roman moralists believed that a respectable citizen should preserve dignitas (dignity) and gravitas (seriousness). To display one s body on stage, to impersonate others, or to provoke laughter was considered undignified. The actor sold their body and voice for public pleasure, which made the profession inherently shameful. This attitude was consistent with how Roman society viewed other entertainers. Gladiators might achieve celebrity in the arena, and charioteers could command passionate fan followings, but both were technically degraded in status. Performers were celebrated in spectacle but lacked any standing in civic life. The life of a Roman actor Evidence from inscriptions, satirical writings and contracts paints a picture of precariousness. Troupes travelled from town to town, dependent on festivals and civic sponsorship for work, while pay was unreliable; some actors received generous gifts, others little more than food and board. The constant would have been the rehearsals. Actors trained their voices to carry across open-air theatres, practised precise gestures codified to signal emotions and maintained the masks, costumes and props essential for performance. Injuries would have been common, especially in physical pantomimes involving acrobatics.  | The overshadowed ancient empire that rivalled Rome with maritime might and an iron fist  But that doesn t mean that we don t know about some very famous actors,  says Clarke.  One we know of is called Clodius Aesopus. He was the most famous tragic actor in the late Republic. Cicero was friends with him.  Aesopus, active in the first century BC, was celebrated for bringing Greek classics to Roman audiences. As Clarke notes, he became a personal acquaintance of Marcus Tullius Cicero, one of Rome s greatest statesmen, orators and philosophers, whose speeches still survive as masterpieces of Latin prose. That such a figure could publicly befriend an actor underscores the inherent paradox: Aesopus was admired, wealthy and socially connected, yet in law he remained infamis. Life as a Roman actor was full of strange contradictions. The art form of theatre was a powerful political tool, theatres themselves were magnificent constructions, audiences were vast and enthusiastic, and some performers became famous enough to mingle with Rome s elite. Yet the profession itself stripped actors of rights and respect. It was a life lived in the spotlight, but without dignity. Ad Jessica Clarke was speaking to Emily Briffett on the HistoryExtra podcast. Listen to the full conversation.",
        "target_summary": "Roman society was meticulously stratified, where profession and public perception rigidly dictated one’s standing. Actors, despite their dazzling performances before vast audiences, were branded \"infamis\" – people of ill repute, stripped of civic rights and denied bodily autonomy, grouped alongside slaves and prostitutes. Roman moralists deemed their public display of the body and impersonation undignified, consigning them to the lowest social echelons, thus creating a paradoxical existence of stardom intertwined with profound social degradation.\n\nThe era of Emperor Augustus (27 BC – AD 14) marked a \"golden age\" for Roman theatre, as he shrewdly leveraged it as a potent political tool. Part of the \"panem et circenses\" strategy, theatre offered free entertainment, cultivating loyalty and a shared Roman identity. Augustus orchestrated the construction of hundreds of colossal theatres across the empire, like the Theatre of Marcellus which could seat over 10,000 spectators. These architectural marvels featured impressive multi-tiered seating and richly adorned backdrops (*scaenae frons*). Unlike Greek traditions, Roman venues welcomed both men and women, with seating meticulously arranged by social rank. Audiences enjoyed a diverse repertoire from solemn tragedies and ribald comedies to farcical mimes and intricate pantomimes, often funded by magistrates or emperors for free admission.\n\nThe Roman stage, however, was predominantly male. While some evidence suggests women participated in lower-status mime and pantomime, official roles were reserved for men, who utilized elaborate masks to portray female characters, exaggerate expressions, and amplify their voices across the immense open-air auditoriums.\n\nDespite the inherent societal disdain, actors underwent rigorous training, perfecting their voices and codified gestures. Their lives were often precarious, dependent on travel and civic sponsorship, with fluctuating pay.

This personal admiration, however, could not alter their legal status; Aesopus, like all actors, remained *infamis*.\n\nUltimately, Roman theatre presented a stark contradiction: a powerful cultural and political force showcased in magnificent venues to enthusiastic crowds, yet its practitioners were denied basic rights and social dignity.

        "title": "Living with the dead? You need to know these 7 gruesome facts about the history of human burial",
        "content": "From the depths of prehistory, human societies have grappled with the same question: how do we treat the dead? Those many varying answers offer a valuable insight into how people across history have understood life, faith and human relationships. Ad From Tutankhamun s tomb to the mysterious Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo, many of the most famous   and culturally significant   historical and archaeological discoveries have centred around the notion of burial. It s for that reason that historian Roger Luckhurst, author of Graveyards: A History of Living with the Dead, thinks that burial practices say as much about the living and their societies, as they do about the dead. In a conversation on the HistoryExtra podcast, Luckhurst shared seven important (and unsettling) facts that trace how our relationship with death has evolved across history. 1. Homo sapiens weren t the first to bury our dead For centuries, archaeologists thought deliberate burial marked the beginning of humanity. Care for the dead, they argued, was the dividing line between Homo sapiens other human species, like Homo heidelbergensis or the Denisovans.  It used to be the case that archaeologists thought that they could identify Homo sapiens by how they cared for their dead,  Luckhurst says.  Actually, there are other versions of [archaic humans] who were burying their dead probably intentionally.  But recent discoveries have challenged that assumption.  | When and why did Neanderthals go extinct? Now, archaeological evidence seems to suggest that other human species, including Neanderthals, carefully laid their dead in shallow graves, possibly alongside flowers. One of the most famous examples is in Spain s Sima de las Palomas archaeological site, where a Neanderthal woman and her child seem to have been buried together, with their bodies positioned in a specific way. Far from the brutish caricature of early humans, Neanderthals may have shared our impulse to mark death as a meaningful part of life. 2. Nations recruit their dead to tell stories about themselves From ancient empires to modern democracies, death has always served politics in the form of monuments and memorials.  If you think about most national narratives, it's nearly always about the sacrifice of the people who founded the modern nation,  says Luckhurst.  In England we have this celebration of Memorial Day in November to mark the Armistice [at the end of the First World War]. And there are monuments in every village and every church for those who died in the two world wars.  Across Europe, the aftermath of the world wars turned graveyards into civic altars. Cenotaphs, war cemeteries and endless rows of white crosses framed sacrifice as the foundation of unity and national image. But the phenomenon of using the dead to tell a broader story extends beyond the West.  In Africa, one of my favourite graveyards is in Zimbabwe,  says Luckhurst,  where the cemetery is shaped like an AK-47 rifle because that's the rifle that the people buried there used as independence fighters   the graves are [shaped like] bullets in the magazine.  3. Lenin s corpse sparked a modern cult of preservation When Vladimir Lenin died in 1924, the newly formed Soviet Union faced a problem: how should its revolutionary hero be memorialised?  He died after the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun,  says Luckhurst,  and the Soviets thought,  There's a preserved body that s laid for thousands of years, why don't we do this with Lenin?  The embalmed body of Vladimir Lenin lies in state, preserved for public viewing after his death in 1924. Displayed in Moscow s Red Square, the Soviet leader s mausoleum became both a shrine to the revolution and a symbol of enduring political power. (Photo by Getty Images) A special laboratory was built beneath Lenin s mausoleum on Red Square, where scientists experimented with chemicals to halt decay. The result was a body that has been preserved for nearly a century, tended to by teams of embalmers who still adjust his features under carefully controlled conditions.  [The Russians] even did this with Ho Chi Minh,  Luckhurst adds,  and kept it hidden for about six years until the Vietnam war was over.  What began as a self-contained Soviet experiment became a Cold War phenomenon, as other communist states adopted the same secular sainthood, embalming leaders from China s Mao Zedong to North Korea s Kim Il-sung. 4. Mummification began long before ancient Egypt The Egyptians made mummification famous, but they weren t the first to use it as a means of caring for their dead.  Mummification is a way of preserving a body by drying it out,  says Luckhurst,  but 2000 years before [ancient Egypt], in Chile there was a culture that was preserving bodies in a different kind of way.  Luckhurst was referring to the Chinchorro culture of coastal Chile and Peru, who as early as 5000 BC carefully prepared their dead with clay masks and natural salts. The region s arid air and saline soil acted as natural preservatives, inspiring deliberate human techniques.  | The pharaohs and dynasties that ruled ancient Egypt Egyptians would later transform that process into a religious art, codified under the Old Kingdom (around 2600 BC) into a 70-day ritual involving resins, oils and linen wrappings. 5. The Catholic world turned bone piles into works of art In medieval and early modern Europe, churchyards filled up quickly. The dead were buried close to sanctified ground, and when space ran out, bones were exhumed to make room for others   leading to the establishment of the ossuary, a monument built to be filled with the bones of the dead. Perhaps the best-known example of an ossuary can be found in the French capital.  Underneath the streets of Paris are hundreds of thousands of skulls,  says Luckhurst.  It's a very Catholic practice and it's designed to help you contemplate death.  In the Catacombs of Paris, six million skeletons were arranged into geometric walls of skulls and femurs. In the Sedlec Ossuary of the Czech Republic, monks turned human bones into chandeliers and coats of arms. Meanwhile, the Capuchin Crypt in Rome displays skeletons posed in niches. These were all intended to show that death was part of salvation s cycle. In the Catacombs of Paris, a man studies a skull by torchlight amid towering stacks of bones. Once part of the city s vast network of quarries, the ossuary now holds the remains of millions of Parisians. (Photo by Getty Images) 6. The Romans built cities of the dead outside their cities of the living Ancient Rome regulated death with remarkable precision. By law, burials were forbidden within city limits, a rule designed to protect both hygiene and sanctity.  They built laws quite quickly that set out that you must bury the dead outside the city limits. And that's where the word  necropolis  comes from,  Luckhurst explains. Along the Via Appia, tombs of senators and freedmen lined the roadside. These necropoleis (literally  cities of the dead ) were public spaces that served as memorials and monuments. Visitors passing through could read inscriptions, admire the sculpture and reflect on the continuity between life and death. 7. Europe s graveyards became dangerously overcrowded By the late Middle Ages, after the disaster of the Black Death, death once again loomed over Europe   and as the population grew, so did the problem.  From the medieval period onwards, some societies decided that they were going to live with the dead, crammed around Christian churches in classic churchyards, but also in the walls or in the crypts of these churches as well. So they started to become part of the architecture in a fundamental way,  says Luckhurst.  But by the 18th century, you start getting a real crisis with people thinking,  What on earth are we going to do with all of these dead?  As cities expanded, burial grounds grew packed. Corpses were layered in shared plots, and decomposing bodies seeped into wells and cellars. In London, decay became a very real public health hazard. It was a crisis that led to reform, and a massive social change. From the early 19th century, the garden cemetery movement transformed burial into something akin to landscape design. New cemeteries such as P re Lachaise in Paris (1804) and Kensal Green in London (1832) created tree-lined avenues and manicured plots that restored order to how the dead were buried. It was a distinct shift. Now, people weren t surrounded by the dead in the cities; the dead were no longer ever-present. Instead, they were separated from the living   out of sight, and, eventually, out of mind. Ad Roger Luckhurst was speaking to Ellie Cawthorne on the HistoryExtra podcast. Listen to the full conversation.",
        "target_summary": "Throughout history, human societies have universally grappled with the profound question of how to treat their dead, with the diverse answers providing an invaluable lens into historical understandings of life, faith, and human relationships. From the majestic tomb of Tutankhamun to the enigmatic Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo, many seminal archaeological discoveries underscore the central role of interment practices. Historian Roger Luckhurst, author of *Graveyards: A History of Living with the Dead*, posits that these practices reveal as much about the living and their societies as they do about the departed, tracing the intricate evolution of humanity's relationship with death through seven compelling insights.\n\nFirstly, contrary to long-held archaeological beliefs, *Homo sapiens* were not the sole species to deliberately inter their dead. Recent discoveries challenge the notion that care for the dead marked the exclusive dawn of humanity, with evidence now suggesting that other archaic human species, including Neanderthals, carefully laid their deceased in shallow graves, potentially adorned with flowers. Sites like Spain’s Sima de las Palomas reveal Neanderthal burials arranged with specific intent, suggesting a shared, profound impulse to acknowledge death as a meaningful part of existence, far removed from earlier brutish caricatures.\n\nBeyond individual grief, nations, both ancient and modern, adeptly harness their dead to construct powerful national narratives. Memorials and monuments stand as civic altars, weaving tales of sacrifice and unity. In Britain, Armistice Day marks profound remembrance, with countless village and church memorials honouring those lost in two world wars, framing their sacrifice as the bedrock of national identity. This phenomenon extends globally; in Zimbabwe, a cemetery dramatically shaped like an AK-47 rifle, with graves resembling bullets, powerfully commemorates independence fighters, demonstrating how collective memory is physically embodied to tell a nation's story.\n\nA pioneering, modern cult of preservation was catalyzed by the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924 within the newly formed Soviet Union. Inspired by the discovery of Tutankhamun's enduring remains, Soviet authorities embarked on an unprecedented scientific endeavour to embalm their revolutionary hero. A specialized laboratory beneath Lenin's mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square meticulously preserved his body, transforming it into an everlasting shrine and a potent symbol of political power. This initial Soviet experiment burgeoned into a Cold War phenomenon, with other communist states adopting secular sainthood through the embalming of leaders like China’s Mao Zedong and North Korea’s Kim Il-sung, maintaining their physical presence as enduring ideological beacons.\n\nFurthermore, mummification, though famously associated with ancient Egypt, originated millennia earlier. The Chinchorro culture of coastal Chile and Peru, as far back as 5000 BC, mastered sophisticated preservation techniques, preparing their dead with clay masks and natural salts. Leveraging the region’s arid climate and saline soils, they developed deliberate human methods for desiccation long before Egyptians codified the process into a complex, 70-day religious art involving resins, oils, and linen wrappings around 2600 BC.\n\nIn medieval and early modern Europe, overflowing churchyards led the Catholic world to transform bone piles into arresting works of art and spiritual contemplation. As burial space became scarce, exhumed remains were collected in ossuaries—monuments built explicitly to house the bones of the dead. The Catacombs of Paris, a vast subterranean labyrinth, dramatically arrange six million skeletons into geometric walls of skulls and femurs. Similarly, the Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic features macabre chandeliers and coats of arms crafted from human bones, while Rome’s Capuchin Crypt displays posed skeletons. These stark displays served as profound meditations on mortality, reminding the living of salvation’s cyclical nature.\n\nAncient Rome meticulously regulated death, forbidding burials within city limits for reasons of both hygiene and sanctity. This decree led to the creation of \"necropoleis\" or \"cities of the dead,\" vast public spaces situated just outside urban centers. Along thoroughfares like the Via Appia, elaborate tombs of senators and freedmen lined the roadsides, serving as perpetual memorials and monuments. These monumental necropoleis allowed visitors to contemplate inscriptions, admire sculptures, and reflect on the enduring continuum between life and death, fostering a unique blend of public remembrance and private grief.\n\nFinally, by the late Middle Ages, exacerbated by the Black Death and subsequent population growth, Europe faced a burgeoning crisis of dangerously overcrowded graveyards. Centuries of interment in churchyards, crypts, and walls meant the dead became fundamentally integrated into urban architecture. However, by the 18th century, the sheer volume of decomposing bodies in densely packed plots posed severe public health hazards, as seepage contaminated wells and cellars, particularly in rapidly expanding cities like London. This looming crisis spurred significant social reform: the early 19th-century garden cemetery movement. Pioneering sites like Père Lachaise in Paris (1804) and Kensal Green in London (1832) transformed burial into a serene landscape design, featuring tree-lined avenues and manicured plots. This marked a profound shift, physically separating the dead from the living, gradually shifting them \"out of sight, and, eventually, out of mind.\"",

(Photo by Getty Images) Hosted by historian Dr Kate Lister, Betwixt the Sheets: The History of Sex, Scandal and Society explores the intimate   and often overlooked   aspects of the human past. Lister, best known for her research on sexuality, brings academic expertise and irreverence, making the podcast distinctive in both its tone and content. The scope ranges from medieval sex manuals and contraception to the history of drag and the sexual politics of the Cold War. It highlights voices often absent from mainstream history, including stories of sex workers, queer communities and women navigating restrictive systems, while also revealing how sexuality indelibly intersects with politics, economics and religion. Dan Carlin s Hardcore History Dan Carlin s Hardcore History reshaped how history is told in audio form. Launched in 2006, it showed that audiences would happily devote hours (even half a day) to listen to a podcast episode about the past. Dan Carlin, a former journalist and broadcaster rather than a professional historian, delivers with a distinctive style; he immerses listeners in the period he s reflecting on, urging them to imagine what it was like to live in the past   from the Mongol conquests to the trenches of Verdun. Series such as Blueprint for Armageddon (on the First World War, running nearly 24 hours) or The Wrath of the Khans (on the Mongol empire) have become legendary. Episodes are released irregularly but each feels like a mammoth event: truly immersive and unforgettable.

Dalrymple s expertise on India and the East India Company is complemented by Anand s journalistic questioning, producing a compelling mix of analysis and storytelling. The series on the Yalta Conference of 1945, as Hitler s defeat became increasingly imminent, is a particular highlight. It explores the unique roles of Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin in determining the future of postwar Europe, and how they interacted at this moment of seismic significance. Fall of Civilizations Fall of Civilizations is an exploration of history s great societies and how they collapsed, from the Maya and Khmer Empire to the Norse of Greenland and the Roman west. Episodes are long (often exceeding two hours) but host Paul Cooper s reflective narration, careful research and immersive sound design all combine to make for an engaging listen. He blends archaeology, primary sources and cultural history to ask not just why civilisations fell in the first place, but what lessons their decline can offer.

In Our Time Laurent P cheux s dramatic painting The Assassination of Julius Caesar captures the moment in 44 BC when Roman senators turned on their leader. The work reflects Enlightenment-era fascination with republican virtue, tyranny, and the fall of great men. (Photo by Getty Images) Broadcast on BBC Radio 4 since 1998 and now available as a podcast, In Our Time has become well-known in the audio space. Host Melvyn Bragg   who has announced his departure from the show after 26 years   convenes a panel of specialist scholars to discuss a single topic from history, from the fall of the Roman Republic to the philosophy of Spinoza. Bragg s direct questioning unveils the scholarly disagreements surrounding subjects, and results in engaging conversation. The archive now runs to more than a thousand episodes across history, science, philosophy, religion and culture. The Rest is History Fronted by prominent British historians (not to mention BBC History Magazine contributors) Dominic Sandbrook and Tom Holland, The Rest is History has become a true podcasting phenomenon, regularly topping charts   even outside of the history category. Episodes veer from one-off explorations of figures such as Lope de Aguirre or John Dee to multi-part series on topics ranging from the fall of Anglo-Saxon England to the Watergate scandal (and everything between). But perhaps the real appeal lies in the hosts  chemistry. The pair have known each other for decades, and the strength of their relationship creates a space to navigate challenging subjects with their wit and intellectual curiosity.

(Photo by Getty Images) Produced by American public broadcaster NPR and hosted by Ramtin Arablouei and Rund Abdelfatah, Throughline traces the historical roots of present issues. Episodes on subjects such as immigration, policing and the politics of oil show how today s debates are only the sharp point of centuries of ideas and change. Blending journalism and history, the podcast employs archival audio, interviews and music to create richly produced episodes, usually under 60 minutes. While many focus on American history, the scope is international, with features on Afghanistan, Haiti and the Ottoman empire among others. You re Dead to Me Hosted by public historian Greg Jenner   perhaps best known for his work on TV comedy series Horrible Histories   the BBC Radio Four series You're Dead to Me combines solid research with humour. The result is a version of history that s accessible without being simplistic. Topics range from Joan of Arc to the Harlem Renaissance, with episodes also highlighting histories often overlooked elsewhere. Jenner s skill as a moderator ensures the conversations stay lively and well-paced. Ad But what really sets the show apart is its ability to balance fun and seriousness, offering an entertaining introduction to a wide span of historical figures and themes without getting bogged down too heavily by intricate details.",

        "content": "Biography & Historical Figures Icon, Libertine, Leader: The Life and Presidency of John F Kennedy Mark White Ad Mark White s study of JFK offers a compelling justification for yet another book on America s iconic president. Portraying Kennedy as youthful, optimistic and effective, it contrasts sharply with today s political gerontocracy. While acknowledging the mythologised image shaped by his assassination, White shows JFK s short presidency was marked by real achievements, both domestic and foreign. His cool and pragmatic handling of crises, especially over Berlin and Cuba, demonstrated strategic acumen, while his late but firm commitment to civil rights gave his leadership moral weight. White doesn t ignore Kennedy s reckless private life, but argues it didn t impair his public role, suggesting his behaviour stemmed from lifelong health issues and a sense of mortality. Boldly stepping into historical  what-ifs , White persuasively contends JFK would have avoided the Vietnam War and pursued moderate reform at home. This tightly argued, post-revisionist account stands out as the finest single-volume analysis of Kennedy s presidency   an enlightening and engaging read. Reviewer: Iwan Morgan is emeritus professor of United States studies at University College London Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The Rebel Romanov Helen Rappaport Helen Rappaport breathes life into the lost story of Princess Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld   Queen Victoria s  forgotten  aunt. With her signature flair for untangling forgotten corners of royal history, Rappaport uncovers the harrowing journey of a teenage girl thrust into the icy rituals of tsarist Russia and the violent hands of a disturbed husband, Grand Duke Konstantin. Julie s refusal to accept her fate   fleeing not once, but twice   marks her as a quietly radical figure amid Europe s rigid dynastic chessboard. Her life, largely self-erased from history out of fear and isolation, is here reclaimed with empathy, vivid detail and sharp insight. Rappaport also explores how Julie s ambitious yet relatively obscure noble family, led by the formidable matriarch Augusta, reshaped post-Napoleonic Europe through marriage. Rebel Romanov is both a deeply personal biography and a searing critique of aristocratic power, finally giving Julie the voice history denied her. Reviewer: Danny Bird, Content Producer of BBC History Magazine Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The Brothers Grimm: A Biography Ann Schmiesing Ann Schmiesing s biography of the Brothers Grimm is a long-overdue and richly rewarding study, filling a 50-year gap in English-language scholarship. Best known for their fairy tales, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were also pioneering figures in philology, mythology and folklore, shaping these disciplines profoundly. Schmiesing offers a highly readable and comprehensive account of their intellectual legacy, placing it firmly within the historical and political context of 19th-century Germany. She captures their close personal bond and family dynamics, as well as their involvement in events like the Napoleonic Wars and the G ttingen Seven protest. Importantly, she doesn t shy away from addressing the problematic aspects of their work, including instances of antisemitism, offering a nuanced view of German Romanticism s legacy. This is an essential read not only for folklorists and fairy-tale scholars but for anyone interested in the wider cultural and intellectual currents of the period. Reviewer: Paul Cowdell, honorary senior research associate at the University of Bristol Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The Scapegoat: The Brilliant Brief Life of the Duke of Buckingham Lucy Hughes-Hallett Lucy Hughes-Hallett s Scapegoat delivers a rich, expansive portrait of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham   the dazzling court favourite of both James VI & I and Charles I. In over 600 pages, the author moves beyond the myth of  the handsomest-bodied man in all of England  to reveal a complex, flawed, and contradictory figure. Buckingham s meteoric rise was matched by scandal, corruption, and ultimately, a brutal fall. His relationships with both kings form a compelling, often fraught triangle of power, love, and loyalty. Hughes-Hallett s thematic approach makes this more than biography   it's a vivid, fast-paced journey through the intrigue of early Stuart court life, enriched by scandal, politics, and personal drama. Her prose is sharp, her detail meticulous, and her portrait of Buckingham both absorbing and humane. Scapegoat is not only an engaging study of one man s rise and ruin, but a strikingly colourful account of a pivotal era in British and European history. Reviewer: Joseph Ellis is a historical researcher at the University of York, specialising in the royal progresses of James VI & I Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org When We Ruled Paula Akpan This is a thrilling reclamation of African history through the lives of 12 extraordinary women who shaped empires, defied colonisers and redefined gender expectations across a millennium. Paula Akpan brings these rulers   like the cunning Queen Njinga of Ndongo and Matamba, the fiercely independent Ranavalona of Madagascar and the revolutionary Yaa Asantewaa of Ghana   vividly to life, balancing their triumphs with their complexities. Rather than flattening these figures into symbols of resistance or virtue, Akpan delves into the messy, powerful and sometimes violent realities of their rule. This is not a dry history lesson; it s a vibrant conversation between past and present, informed by community voices, a diverse array of perspectives and a sharp critique of colonial archives. Akpan challenges dominant narratives with clarity and passion, asking not just who ruled, but how and why their legacies endure or have been obscured. When We Ruled is essential reading for anyone interested in African history, women, power and memory. Reviewer: Danny Bird, Content Producer of BBC History Magazine Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Ancient & Medieval History Between Two Rivers: Ancient Mesopotamia and the Birth of History Moudhy Al-Rashid In this concise yet illuminating work, Oxford Assyriologist Moudhy Al-Rashid explores how ancient Mesopotamians understood and recorded their past, drawing from a vast body of writings preserved on clay tablets. Spanning from 3500 BC to the first century AD, Al-Rashid s engaging narrative weaves nine essays around artefacts from the so-called  Ennigaldi-Nanna s museum , examining how history was perceived, taught, and displayed. She amplifies voices often unheard in ancient records: women, children and the enslaved, while interrogating the role of scholars in shaping historical understanding. Al-Rashid s highly personal style reveals history not as a neutral chronicle but as an evolving construct shaped by belief, cosmology and political power. While the book sidesteps certain philosophical questions such as conceptions of time or the effects of writing on oral tradition, it remains a revelatory study of  the history of history . Reviewer: Gojko Barjamovic is a senior lecturer in near eastern languages and civilisations and senior research scholar at Yale University Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Inventing the Renaissance: Myths of a Golden Age Ada Palmer Ada Palmer s Inventing the Renaissance offers a lively, accessible exploration of Renaissance political thought, centring on Machiavelli and the humanist tradition. While it touches on the Borgias and Medici for context, the real focus is Machiavelli s radical ideas, particularly his prioritisation of consequences over morals or rules, positioning him as a forerunner of utilitarianism. Palmer excels at explaining humanism s evolving definitions and Machiavelli s ambiguous place within it. The book combines scholarly insight with an idiosyncratic, blog-like style: humorous asides, comic dialogues and quirky chapter titles abound. Some readers may find the tone uneven, with jokes occasionally misfiring, but the philosophical content is strong and clearly explained. Though sprawling and at times tangential, it s an engaging guide to how Renaissance history has been shaped and reshaped by historiography. For those curious about Machiavelli s shock factor and humanism s core, this is an excellent starting point, even if more traditional art coverage lies elsewhere. Reviewer: Catherine Fletcher is professor of history at Manchester Metropolitan University. Her latest book is The Roads to Rome: A History Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Holy Places: How Pilgrimage Changed the World Kathryn Hurlock Kathryn Hurlock s Holy Places explores why pilgrimage is booming despite the decline of organised religion in the West. She examines 19 global sites, from Lourdes in France to Karbala in Iraq and Tai Shan in China, offering concise historical accounts that highlight their rituals and significance. While some pilgrims may begin these journeys for leisure, Hurlock suggests that walking in ancient footsteps often sparks unexpected introspection. She challenges the idea that modern pilgrimage is merely tourism, noting its long-standing commercial aspects. However, her academic approach   rich in notes and context but lacking personal experience or on-the-ground reportage   may leave some readers wanting more emotional depth. The book s strength lies in its clarity and breadth, but its cool, rational tone feels slightly detached from the passion and yearning that often define pilgrimage. For those seeking a thoughtful, scholarly introduction to sacred travel, Holy Places will appeal. For others, it may feel too dispassionate for its deeply human subject. Reviewer: Peter Stanford is a writer, broadcaster and author of Pilgrimage: Journeys of Meaning Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Summer of Fire and Blood: The German Peasants  War Lyndal Roper Lyndal Roper vividly recounts the brutal 1524 25 uprisings across the German lands, where thousands of peasants, motivated by communal grievances, attacked monasteries and castles with unprecedented fury. While largely non-violent, notable atrocities   such as the Weinsberg killings   prompted brutal noble retaliation. The rebels, despite their numbers and support from Florian Geyer s cavalry, were no match for the nobles  mercenaries. The resulting bloodshed was immense, with around 100,000 peasants killed in what contemporaries termed the Aufruhr ( turbulence ). Roper narrates these events with clarity and flair, offering a compelling reinterpretation of the revolt s causes. Rather than focusing solely on socio-economic factors, she foregrounds the religious motivations of the rebels, linking their actions to the spiritual upheaval sparked by Martin Luther. Her argument   that this was a revolutionary religious movement   is both persuasive and powerful. This is an essential read for anyone interested in early modern popular protest. Reviewer: Mark Stoyle is the author of A Murderous Midsummer: The Western Rising of 1549 Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The Monastic World: A 1,200-Year History Andrew Jotischky Andrew Jotischky s The Monastic World offers a rich, expansive survey of monasticism across the medieval era, moving beyond western Europe to explore traditions from Egypt to Britain. He includes both Latin and Orthodox practices, ensuring women s monastic experiences are not sidelined. Drawing on foundational texts and saints  lives, Jotischky reveals how small doctrinal differences often sparked deep conflict. From Benedictine traditions to radical ascetics   including pillar-dwelling abbots and naked holy fools   the book presents a strikingly diverse picture of monastic life. Famous figures like Bernard of Clairvaux appear, though military orders and mendicants are deliberately excluded to keep the scope manageable. While mainly chronological, the book is filled with thoughtful digressions. Not for beginners, The Monastic World best suits those with some grounding in medieval Christianity. For such readers, Jotischky s nuanced insights, especially his attention to eastern traditions, offer a rewarding and authoritative read. Reviewer: Dani le Cybulskie is a historian, podcaster and author. Her latest book is Chivalry and Courtesy: Medieval Manners for a Modern World Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The Last Dynasty: Ancient Egypt from Alexander the Great to Cleopatra Toby Wilkinson Toby Wilkinson s The Last Dynasty offers a compelling and accessible account of the enigmatic Ptolemaic dynasty   the last to rule Egypt before Rome s conquest. Often sidelined by both classicists and Egyptologists, the Ptolemies emerge here in vivid detail. Wilkinson masterfully bridges the Greek-speaking Hellenistic world and traditional pharaonic Egypt, deftly handling the diverse sources needed to interpret this cultural fusion. He highlights both the dynasty s glories   Alexandria s splendour, intellectual achievements, monumental temples   and its flaws, including xenophobia, military blunders and poor leadership. Particularly strong is Wilkinson s analysis of the Egyptian context shaping Ptolemaic rule, revealing how Alexander the Great himself was transformed by pharaonic ideology, and his vivid account of Alexander at Luxor Temple underscores how Egypt influenced its conquerors. This richly written book is a vital contribution to Hellenistic scholarship and a superb guide to understanding the Ptolemies on their own, uniquely Egyptian terms. Reviewer: Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones is professor of ancient history at Cardiff University Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Military & War History Allies at War: The Politics of Defeating Hitler Tim Bouverie Tim Bouverie s engaging account of Second World War diplomacy reveals the complex relationship between the  Big Three : Franklin D Roosevelt, Josef Stalin and Winston Churchill   who, despite deep suspicions and rivalries, maintained a fa ade of friendship. Bouverie skilfully balances the ruthless power struggles with moments of genuine diplomatic cooperation, offering a fast-paced narrative backed by extensive archival research, mainly from British sources. He sheds light on lesser-known episodes like the Royal Navy s attack on the French fleet and explores varied neutralities in Ireland and Spain. The book s title, from Churchill s adage    There is only one thing worse than fighting with allies and that is fighting without them    captures the paradox of allied tensions. A striking example is the 1943 Tehran Conference, where Roosevelt s mocking camaraderie with Stalin humiliated Churchill, illustrating the alliance s underlying discord. Yet, Bouverie fairly acknowledges the strength of the Anglo-American partnership. Overall, the book is a nuanced study, suggesting modern leaders might benefit from better diplomatic performances, even if it s just pretending to be friends. Reviewer: Richard Toye is professor of history at the University of Exeter. His books include Winston Churchill: A Life in the News Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Friends in Youth: Choosing Sides in the English Civil War Minoo Dinshaw Dinshaw s book is a clear labour of love, exploring a neglected yet illuminating topic: the intertwined lives of Edward Hyde and Bulstrode Whitelocke, two key political figures on opposite sides of the English Civil War. Former friends with shared views on politics and religion, they both sought peace even as war divided them. Their contrasting fates   Hyde s rise and fall in royalist exile, Whitelocke s decline after parliamentary success   are skilfully traced. The book also examines their intellectual circle, notably Lord Falkland s Great Tew group, and captures the complexities of allegiance in a polarised age. Though marred by occasional factual errors, tangential misjudgements and a disjointed structure that ends prematurely with Falkland s death, it compensates with elegant prose and rich biographical and political insight. Ultimately, Dinshaw deepens our understanding of the Civil War s human dimensions and offers a thoughtful, engaging account deserving of praise. Reviewer: Ronald Hutton is professor of history at the University of Bristol Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Her Secret Service: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence Claire Hubbard-Hall Claire Hubbard-Hall s compelling and deeply researched book dismantles the sexist notion that secretaries in British intelligence needed only  good legs and a good upbringing . Instead, it reveals the vital, often overlooked roles women played in MI5, MI6 and the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during both world wars. From administrative offices to fieldwork, their impact was profound. Figures like Winifred Spink and Kathleen Pettigrew,  the real Miss Moneypenny , are brought vividly to life. The narrative is rich with stories of espionage, resilience and even absurdities, such as a dog-loving double agent nearly compromising D-Day. Hubbard-Hall avoids clich s, offering fresh insights and personal anecdotes that highlight both adventure and institutional injustice. Women s contributions were significant, yet often went unrewarded   still, they pushed boundaries and seized opportunities in a male-dominated world. This eloquent book is both a tribute and a correction to the historical record, an inspiring chronicle of women s grit, ingenuity, and unrecognised brilliance in wartime intelligence. Reviewer: Kate Vigurs is a historian and author. Her latest book is Mission Europe Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Rain of Ruin: Tokyo, Hiroshima and the Surrender of Japan Richard Overy Richard Overy, a leading authority on Second World War bombings, brings sharp insight to Rain of Ruin, a lucid account of the air war against Japan. Avoiding common pitfalls, he integrates Japanese perspectives and highlights the moral ambiguities of strategic bombing, including the development and use of the atomic bomb. Overy critiques the historical erasure of Japanese civilian suffering and challenges the simplistic  bombing equals surrender  narrative. His inclusion of personal testimonies, such as Tsukiyama Mihoro s   a young survivor who witnessed people spontaneously combust during the firebombing of Tokyo on 9-10 March 1945   underlines the brutality of the campaign. While he remains cautious in drawing conclusions, his work invites a reassessment of longstanding triumphalist accounts. The book also reveals surprising facts, like Britain s eagerness to bomb Japan and the early technical struggles of the B-29 programme. Overy s sober and balanced analysis marks a significant step towards a more inclusive and honest reckoning with the war in Asia, even if the controversy around Allied actions endures.

Once again, the lawyer and author Philippe Sands is on the trail of those accused of crimes against humanity, in this case SS officer Walther Rauff, who wound up in southern Chile, and that country s former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, who Sands himself encountered in a London courtroom at the turn of this century. Deftly blending history, law, memoir and travelogue, 38 Londres Street centres on two key questions: did Rauff assist in Pinochet s brutal repressions? And why was Pinochet able to leave Britain without standing trial for his alleged crimes? Beyond this, Sands also explores what the tales of these men tell us about the concepts of immunity and impunity, which remain as vitally important today as in the years covered by the book. Reviewer: Robert Attar, Editor of BBC History Magazine Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Patria: Lost Countries of South America Laurence Blair In this engaging and well-researched book, Laurence Blair takes readers on a sweeping journey across South America, blending travelogue with historical reflection. He brings to light lesser-known histories of resistance, forgotten kingdoms and unrealised political dreams, arguing that the continent s past still shapes its present. Blair challenges myths, showing the Amazon as a human-shaped environment and recounting how indigenous groups and escaped slaves forged autonomous societies. He focuses on the stories of the vanquished, whose perspectives, he suggests, reveal deeper truths than the victors  narratives. Yet while the book vividly captures South America s complexity and lost potential, it sometimes misses opportunities to probe deeper, particularly into how and why certain memories persist while others fade. Still, Blair s commitment to uncovering buried histories is admirable. His central question:  What might have been?  lingers, even as his answers remain partial. The result is a fascinating, thought-provoking read that connects past and present with insight and empathy. Reviewer: Tamar Herzog is Monroe Gutman professor of Latin American affairs at Harvard University Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The CIA Book Club: The Best-Kept Secret of the Cold War Charlie English The CIA Book Club uncovers the CIA s little-known campaign to smuggle banned books by authors like George Orwell, Virginia Woolf and Albert Camus into 1980s Poland, supporting the fight for democracy. While the CIA had long operated cultural initiatives across Eastern Europe, this effort intensified during the Cold War s final years, aligning with a global democratic surge. English s well-researched study offers an alternative to the CIA s usual image, focusing on subtle influence: money, propaganda and print. Figures like Miros aw Chojecki, key to Poland s Solidarity movement, received covert support, becoming cultural leaders in their own right. Though some, like Frances Stonor Saunders, accused the CIA of cultural manipulation, others viewed these efforts more favourably. English avoids simplistic conclusions, offering a nuanced social history of a covert book programme that, while not the Cold War s best-kept secret, is certainly one of its most compelling stories. Ultimately, the book s optimistic tone reflects Poland s relatively successful democratic transition. Reviewer: Richard J Aldrich is professor of international security at the University of Warwick Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The Hohenzollerns and the Nazis: A History of Collaboration Stephan Malinowski Stephan Malinowski s compelling and meticulously researched book exposes the long-overlooked complicity of Germany s former royal family, the Hohenzollerns, in the rise of Nazism. While ex-Kaiser Wilhelm II faded into bitter exile, his son,  Crown Prince  Wilhelm, played a far more active and sinister role, aligning himself with far-right forces and later endorsing Adolf Hitler as a means of restoring the monarchy. Though Hitler cynically exploited the monarchists  support, he ultimately discarded them, leaving the Hohenzollerns politically irrelevant but still publicly loyal. Malinowski dismantles the post-war myth of aristocratic resistance to Nazism, showing instead how elites abetted the regime s consolidation of power. He also highlights the continued efforts of the Hohenzollerns to obscure this truth, including lawsuits aimed at silencing critics. This readable and courageous work should be essential reading for anyone interested in the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany and the ongoing struggle over historical memory and justice in reunified Germany. Reviewer: Sir Richard J Evans is Regius professor emeritus of history at the University of Cambridge. His latest book is Hitler s People: The Faces of the Third Reich Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The Nazi Mind: Twelve Warnings from History Laurence Rees Laurence Rees delivers a chilling, deeply engaging exploration of how ordinary people became complicit in extraordinary evil. Drawing on decades of interviews, including conversations with former Nazis and Holocaust survivors, Rees dives into the psychological and cultural forces that shaped the Nazi worldview. This isn t military history, it s a forensic investigation into the human mind under authoritarian pressure. Rees blends neuroscience, oral testimony and philosophy to illuminate how manipulation, fear and ideological fervour took root, particularly among the young. Central to Rees s book is his recollection of an encounter with an ex-Waffen SS officer who continued to revere Nazism despite all the devastation and genocidal mania it had inflicted. Sceptical of posterity s ability to learn lessons from the past, Rees instead offers  warnings  that encourage critical thinking over simplistic judgment. With sobering insight and personal urgency, this book reminds us that understanding the human mind is perhaps our best defence against repeating history s darkest chapters. Reviewer: Danny Bird, Content Producer of BBC History Magazine Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Cultural, Social & Intellectual History Every Valley: The Story of Handel s Messiah Charles King Charles King s Every Valley is a sweeping, erudite exploration of Handel s iconic oratorio, though not without its flaws. While not a Handel expert, King s diligent research and extensive bibliography lend credibility and his tripartite structure reflects the libretto s original organisation. He weaves five interconnected narratives with enthusiasm, offering rewarding historical context on 17th and 18th-century Britain, including the Glorious Revolution, colonialism and Enlightenment thinkers. His prose is engaging and his insights into character networks are often perceptive. However, tangents   such as the story of Ayuba Diallo   occasionally feel extraneous. Crucially, King falters on musical analysis; errors about performers and superficial commentary on Messiah s score betray a limited grasp of Handel s music. Nonetheless, despite its imprecision in fine musical detail, the book succeeds in painting a vivid, compelling portrait of the world in which Messiah was born. It s a flawed but imaginative and ambitious account. Reviewer: David Vickers is a lecturer at the Royal Northern College of Music Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Holy Men of the Electromagnetic Age: A Forgotten History of the Occult Raphael Cormack In late 1924, author Arthur Conan Doyle hailed modern spiritualism as miraculous, drawing comparisons between s ance phenomena and biblical wonders. Doyle s recognition of the wonder of the unknown is reflected in the narratives presented in Holy Men of the Electromagnetic Age: A Forgotten History of the Occult, a book which explores the allure of the mystical during times of political and social upheaval by focusing on the transnational careers of two little-known figures: Tahra Bey, a self-styled fakir who captivated 1920s Paris, and Dr Dahesh, founder of a pan-religious doctrine blending hypnotism and spiritualism. Drawing on European and Arabic archival sources, Cormack does not shy away from acknowledging gaps in the records. Rather than weakening the narrative, the inclusion of uncorroborated events highlights the ways in which hearsay and word of mouth fuelled celebrity. By reviving these enigmatic  holy men,  the book offers a compelling cultural history of occultism in the Middle East, revealing how myths form from humanity s search for meaning in turbulent times. Cormack s study is both insightful and engaging, filling a notable gap in spiritualist scholarship. Reviewer: Fiona Snailham, lecturer in English literature at the University of Greenwich Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org London Uncanny: A Gothic Guide to the Capital in Weird History and Fiction Clive Bloom This idiosyncratic journey through fantasy and the paranormal begins at a dubious 1930s s ance in Sydenham and leaps through time, blending fact and fiction. From 1970s poltergeists in London s suburbs to Clive Barker s Hellraiser and Dickens s haunting Night Walks, the book is eclectic and pleasantly disorientating. Familiar supernatural tales like Spring-Heeled Jack and Aleister Crowley sit alongside surprising insights   such as TS Eliot dressing up as Dr Crippen and Montague Summers  Black Mass in Hampstead. The chaotic structure may frustrate those expecting a linear Gothic history, but it mirrors the disorder of the Gothic metropolis. Bloom, for example, uniquely intertwines Gothic literature with pop culture, including a David Bowie video and ABBA s ghostly holograms. The book concludes with Gilbert and George providingan eerie metaphor for urban Gothic in Spitalfields, a weird, compelling meditation on death and life intertwined. Reviewer: Lee Jackson, author of Dickensland: The Curious History of Dickens s London Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org No Ordinary Deaths: A People s History of Mortality Molly Conisbee Molly Conisbee s overview of British cultural life is a labour of love, blending personal stories with broader reflections on mortality. She explores England s pre- and post-Reformation customs, the 19th-century rise of funeral directors and modern ideas of a  good death . The book meanders through fascinating topics like industrialisation, Victorian mourning attire and social class, juxtaposing figures such as Edvard Munch and CS Lewis to show how grief shaped their work. Detailed chapters cover beliefs about body, soul and afterlife, plus mourning traditions across England, Wales and Ireland. Conisbee highlights harsh 1832 laws on medical dissection and addresses memorials for same-sex relationships. She is committed to telling the stories of those often overlooked by history. The book s eclectic flow reflects new research and folklore and is overall an engaging and thoughtful survey of death in British culture.

The History of a Dangerous Idea Fara Dabhoiwala Fara Dabhoiwala s What Is Free Speech? is a masterful, revisionist history that exposes the myth of free speech absolutism. Dabhoiwala shows how appeals to free expression often mask selective, self-serving agendas. He argues that speech, far from being inherently free, has always been constrained by power, context and consequence. Foundational texts like Cato s Letters were partisan tools rather than principled defences, while later liberal icons such as JS Mill upheld freedoms that excluded colonial subjects. Though the book ranges globally, it centres on the US, where the First Amendment and tech giants have turned free speech into both a cultural battleground and a corporate shield. Dabhoiwala s conclusion is cautious: free speech debates are rarely about speech alone. His deeper point is clear: when someone claims to defend free speech absolutely, it s worth asking:  Whose speech, and to what end?

Exploring six institutions   market, state, community, religion, guild and family   she identifies how each has shaped epidemics and public health outcomes. Her analysis challenges myths, revealing more complex social dynamics whereby many of the wealthier inhabitants fled before quarantine was imposed. Ogilvie stresses that being poor in a pandemic is disadvantageous and highlights the importance not just of state power, but also its motivation, municipal structures and community cooperation. She shows how strong family ties can both help and hinder public health. The book concludes with cautious optimism: while no institution is perfect, societies have gradually improved their capacity to manage disease through innovation and coordination. Ogilvie avoids simple answers, but suggests that a balance of institutional diversity, social trust and an effective state offers the best defence against future pandemics.

Despite being exposed as a hoax, many clung to it because it felt true to their pre-existing beliefs about US war policy. Tinline shows how people often adopt beliefs based on comfort rather than truth, cherry-picking evidence or relying on feelings instead of facts. This hoax did not significantly alter public opinion or ignite conspiracy theorising but fits into a broader history of distrust. Tinline skilfully avoids grand claims or partisan bias, portraying extreme scepticism of the military-industrial complex as a bipartisan phenomenon. The book illustrates how beliefs sometimes arise not from reality but from what feels true, offering a thoughtful exploration of why Americans distrust official narratives.

His books include Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Believe Them Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Story of a Murder: The Wives, the Mistress and Dr Crippen Hallie Rubenhold In 1910, music hall performer Belle Elmore went missing. Her husband Dr Hawley Harvey Crippen claimed Belle had gone to America to visit a dying relative. But before long, the seemingly respectable doctor's stories began to unravel and he went on the run, triggering an international manhunt that gripped the globe. In Story of a Murder, Hallie Rubenhold reconstructs this Edwardian cause c l bre. But, as in her previous book on the Jack the Ripper murders, The Five, the historian rewrites the narrative of this well-known case by placing the spotlight back onto the victim. She seeks to rehabilitate Belle s image from the misogynist press coverage of the day, and reveals how her life intersected with some of the darkest undercurrents of the age. A wholly gripping and forensically researched read for those who prefer true crime stories that offer enlightening social commentary over prurience or gore.

The book acknowledges his reckless private life, linking it to health, but argues it didn't impair his public role, persuasively contending JFK would have avoided Vietnam and pursued moderate reform.\n\nHelen Rappaport's **\"The Rebel Romanov\"** vividly resurrects Princess Juliane, Queen Victoria's \"forgotten\" aunt, chronicling her harrowing journey through tsarist Russia and escape from a disturbed husband. Rappaport portrays Julie as a quietly radical figure, twice fleeing her predetermined fate on Europe's rigid dynastic chessboard. This empathetic biography reclaims a life largely erased by fear, revealing how her ambitious family reshaped post-Napoleonic Europe through strategic marriages, standing as a searing critique of aristocratic power.\n\nAnn Schmiesing's **\"The Brothers Grimm: A Biography\"** fills a 50-year gap, offering a richly rewarding study beyond their famous fairy tales.

Despite its sprawling nature, it's an excellent starting point for those curious about Machiavelli's impact and humanism's core.\n\nKathryn Hurlock's **\"Holy Places\"** thoughtfully examines the resurgence of pilgrimage amid declining organized religion, exploring 19 global sites from Lourdes to Tai Shan. Her concise historical accounts detail rituals and significance, suggesting that walking ancient paths often sparks introspection beyond mere leisure.

This meticulously researched, courageous work is essential for understanding Weimar, Nazi Germany, and the struggle over historical memory.\n\nLaurence Rees's **\"The Nazi Mind\"** offers a chilling, deeply engaging exploration of how ordinary people became complicit in extraordinary evil. Drawing on decades of interviews, Rees forensically investigates the psychological and cultural forces shaping the Nazi worldview. Blending neuroscience, oral testimony, and philosophy, he illuminates how manipulation, fear, and ideological fervor took root. Sceptical of posterity's ability to learn, Rees instead offers \"warnings,\" encouraging critical thinking as our best defense against repeating history's darkest chapters.\n\n**Cultural, Social & Intellectual History**\n\nCharles King's **\"Every Valley\"** is a sweeping, erudite exploration of Handel's iconic \"Messiah,\" weaving five interconnected narratives with enthusiastic prose. Despite not being a Handel expert, his diligent research offers rewarding historical context, illuminating 17th and 18th-century Britain, from the Glorious Revolution to Enlightenment thought. While King's musical analysis occasionally falters, the book nonetheless paints a vivid, compelling portrait of the world in which the oratorio was born—a flawed but imaginative and ambitious account.\n\nRaphael Cormack's **\"Holy Men of the Electromagnetic Age\"** explores the allure of the mystical during turbulent times, tracing the transnational careers of two little-known figures: Tahra Bey and Dr Dahesh.

She explores customs from pre-Reformation to modern ideas of a \"good death,\" meandering through fascinating topics like industrialization, Victorian mourning, and social class. Conisbee highlights beliefs about the afterlife, harsh historical laws, and memorials for same-sex relationships, committed to telling overlooked stories. This eclectic, engaging, and thoughtful survey illuminates death's profound shaping of British culture.\n\nFara Dabhoiwala's **\"What Is Free Speech?\"** is a masterful, revisionist history exposing the myth of free speech absolutism. Dabhoiwala argues that appeals to free expression often mask selective agendas, as speech has always been constrained by power and context. From partisan foundational texts to liberal icons who excluded colonial subjects, the book centers on how the US and tech giants have made free speech a cultural battleground and corporate shield. Her cautious conclusion urges asking: \"Whose speech, and to what end?\"\n\n**Crime, Conspiracy & Public Health**\n\nSheilagh Ogilvie's **\"Controlling Contagion\"** expertly tackles the enduring question of effective epidemic control, tracing responses from the Black Death to Covid-19. She examines how six institutions—market, state, community, religion, guild, and family—have shaped public health outcomes, challenging myths and revealing complex social dynamics. Ogilvie highlights the crucial interplay of state motivation, municipal structures, and community cooperation, ultimately suggesting that a balance of institutional diversity and social trust offers the best defense against future pandemics.\n\nPhil Tinline's **\"Ghosts of Iron Mountain\"** recounts the 1967 hoax report satirizing America's war machine, revealing how many clung to its claims because they \"felt true,\" despite evidence. Tinline expertly shows how beliefs often stem from comfort and cherry-picked facts, not reality. Avoiding partisan bias, he places this hoax within a broader history of distrust, offering a thoughtful exploration of why Americans, across political divides, often view official narratives with such profound skepticism.\n\nHallie Rubenhold's **\"Story of a Murder\"** masterfully reconstructs the Edwardian cause célèbre of Dr. Crippen and the disappearance of his wife, Belle Elmore. As in her previous work, Rubenhold rewrites the narrative by placing the spotlight squarely on the victim. She rehabilitates Belle's image from the misogynist press, revealing how her life intersected with the darkest undercurrents of the age. This wholly gripping and forensically researched true crime offers enlightening social commentary.",

        "title": "The Peloponnesian War: Athens fights Sparta for dominance in ancient Greece",
        "content": "What and when was the Peloponnesian War? During the fifth century BC, battles raged on land and at sea in a protracted and bloody conflict between the two leading city-states of ancient Greece: Athens and Sparta. On one side was the supreme naval power of Athens and on the other the dominant Spartan army, with each heading an alliance that involved nearly every single Greek state. The Peloponnesian War of 431-404 BC would reshape the Hellenic world. Ad How do we know about the Peloponnesian War? The pre-eminent account of the war was written by Thucydides, who, despite serving as a general in the Athenian army, is remembered as a forefather of impartial historical study. He began his masterly work, The History of the Peloponnesian War, in the first year of the conflict, 431 BC,  believing that it would be a great war and more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it . Although the war, and Thucydides  work, came to be named after the peninsula of Greece where Sparta and some of its allies were located, the fighting was not confined to the Peloponnese. Battles also devastated the Aegean coastline, the island of Sicily and the Attica region. Were Athens and Sparta once allies? Yes, Athens and Sparta had fought side by side against the Persian invasions of Greece by Darius and then his son Xerxes in the early fifth century BC. Allied Greeks defeated them first at Marathon and then at the battles of Salamis, Mycale and Plataea, crushing the invasions. What was the Delian League? In the aftermath, in 478 BC, an alliance of Greek states called the Delian League was formed as protection against any future Persian attacks. Hundreds of states joined the Delian League, but it came to be so dominated by Athens that the Athenians effectively turned the alliance into an empire. Circling the Aegean Sea, the Athenian Empire built a huge navy of triremes   galleys, more than 30 metres long and with three lines of rowers down the length of each side, capable of great speeds   making Athens the dominant maritime power in Greece. Sparta grew alarmed at Athens  hegemony, which continued to expand due to regular tributes pouring in from across the empire. Athens also planned to rebuild the  Long Walls    miles of fortifications connecting the city to the harbour of Piraeus   so as to offer a link to the sea even at times of siege, making it yet more powerful. What was the Peloponnesian League? While Athens ruled the seas, Sparta had long headed its own alliance of states from the Peloponnese and central Greece   the Peloponnesian League   which commanded a stronger army thanks to much-feared and respected Spartan warriors. Why were the Spartans such great warriors? The lives of Spartan men were consumed by military service and commitment to winning glory in battle. Their constant and brutal training began at the age of seven, when boys would be sent from their families to undergo the ritual of agoge, a form of boot camp. This turned them into a fiercely disciplined and highly trained fighting force, feared across all Greece. During the Persian invasions of the fifth century BC, Sparta had shown its might when 300 warriors and an alliance of Greek city-states, led by King Leonidas, had fought the Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae. Why did the Peloponnesian War start? Fighting had raged for decades before the Peloponnesian War, as Athens and Sparta got involved in the conflicts of other states or exploited circumstances to further their own advantage. This period, sometimes called the First Peloponnesian War, ended with the Thirty Years  Peace in the winter of 446/45 BC   although the uneasy peace lasted only half that time. Athens continued its aggression during the 430s, siding against Corinth, an ally of Sparta, by sending ships to assist its own ally, Corcyra, at the battle of Sybota. Athens then further tested the limits of the peace treaty by laying siege to the Corinthian colony of Poteidaia and issuing, in c432 BC, the Megarian Decree, which essentially imposed a trade embargo on another long-time Spartan ally, Megara. Even then, Sparta did not immediately retaliate, as it honoured the peace and was unready for a long conflict. But war was brewing. What was Sparta s plan? When war finally broke out in 431 BC, Sparta had the lofty aims of liberating Greece from Athenian tyranny and dismantling its empire. Attacking over land, King Archidamus II led an army of hoplites, armed with spears and shields, into the Attica peninsula, leaving destruction and chaos in his wake and robbing Athens of vital resources. He hoped to provoke the enemy and draw them out from their fortified walls into open battle, but Athens refused to take the bait thanks to the guidance of influential statesman Pericles. Instead, Athens used its superior navy to harass Spartan ships and make its own assaults in the Peloponnese. Were there really only 300 Spartans at the battle of Thermopylae? It is true there only 300 Spartan soldiers fought at Thermopylae, but they were not alone... Were the Athenians right not to invite open battle? Even though it may have been regarded as cowardice by the enemy, remaining behind the walls was a savvy move. But disaster struck when Athens was ravaged by plague. Outbreaks wiped out a huge proportion of the population   perhaps as many as a quarter, or around 100,000 people   and decimated the Athenian leadership. Pericles himself succumbed in 429 BC. The plague is thought to have come from sub-Saharan Africa, reaching Athens through the port of Piraeus; the added burden of people from Attica arriving to escape the Spartans only served to spread the disease faster. The fortifications that were keeping Athens safe in war were now keeping the plague inside. The Spartans did not approach the city for fear of catching it themselves, but they simultaneously refused the Athenian calls for peace. Yet Sparta failed to take advantage of a much-weakened Athens as its campaigns on land and sea suffered setbacks. Then when the island of Lesbos looked like rising up in revolt against Athens, which resulted in a blockade being put in place, the Spartans failed to come to their assistance and the island surrendered. In 427 BC, however, Sparta did capture the strategic Athenian ally of Plataea following a lengthy siege. Did either side gain the advantage? With the cautious Pericles gone (he died in 429 BC) and the hawkish Cleon taking over, Athens embarked on a more aggressive strategy. One of the finest generals of the day, Demosthenes, commanded raids on the Peloponnese; he was given a fleet with which he occupied and fortified the remote headland of Pylos; and repelled the assault to win it back. The building of outposts on the Peloponnese created a different problem for Sparta: the Athenians used them to attract runaway helots, or slaves, meaning there were fewer people to work the fields and a higher chance of a slave revolt. As more battles went against them Sparta began suing for peace itself, until terms became more favourable when it achieved victories of its own. The most significant came in 422 BC with the capture of the Athenian colony of Amphipolis. The man Athens had sent to protect it was Thucydides   for his failure, he was exiled and dedicated his time to his impartial history of the war. The distinguished Spartan general Brasidas died in the fight for Amphipolis, as did Athens  Cleon, leaving the way clear for those, on both sides, who desired peace. How long did peace last? The resulting Peace of Nicias   named after the man from Athens sent to negotiate the treaty   was signed in 421 BC. Intended to last 50 years, it ended up lasting just six. In fact, fighting never really stopped, as both sides spent those years trying to win over smaller states, or watched on as allies formed coalitions of their own and kept the conflict going. In 415 BC, war officially resumed when Athens launched a massive assault on Sicily with the aim of capturing Syracuse, a powerful city-state which controlled a large share of Mediterranean trade. If successful, Athens could claim its abundant resources. The expedition started badly, however, as the Athenian commander Alcibiades, who had been accused of the serious crime of impiety and ordered back to Athens, defected to Sparta. Syracuse, with Spartan aid, broke the blockade around Sicily and time and time again defeated the invading army until it was crushed, even in a sea battle. By 413 BC, the few who had not been killed or enslaved were forced to retreat. The invasion was a total disaster for Athens, a major blow to morale and prestige. Did the failure of the Sicily expedition swing the tide? Back in Greece, Sparta certainly looked to be closer to victory over the next few years as it occupied Attica once again and several revolts broke out against Athenian rule. Athens itself was in political turmoil as governments were overthrown and replaced. What s more, the Persians had chosen to back Sparta as they saw the Athenian empire as a threat. And yet, the Spartans and their allies were slow to act, allowing Athens to rebuild and put into service its reserve navy. Athens started winning naval battles again, so much so that by 406 BC, it had actually won back parts of the empire thought to have been lost. What effect did the Peloponnesian War have on democracy in ancient Greece? Find out in our guide to the history of democracy How did the war finally end? It would be a naval victory that won the Peloponnesian War after 27 years, but not an Athenian one. Sparta managed to build an imposing fleet of hundreds of triremes, thanks to Persian money and resources, and put to sea. In 405 BC, the fleet   under the skilled command of Lysander   crushed the Athenians at the battle of Aegospotami, near the Hellespont. Lysander then advanced to Athens itself and forced the city-state to surrender the following year. The victorious Spartans ordered the Long Walls to be demolished, forbade Athens from building a fleet larger than 12 ships and demanded Athens pay them tribute. The Athenian empire was no more; Sparta had emerged as the dominant power in Greece. What happened in Greece after the war? Sparta s position did not last long. It became embroiled in too many conflicts for its army to handle, and its hold over Greece ended with defeat by Thebes and its Boeotian League allies at the battle of Leuctra in 371 BC. Nearly a century of the Peloponnesian War, followed by continued fighting and divisions, had left Greece vulnerable. This instability was exploited by Philip II of Macedon, who invaded and defeated the city-states   laying the foundations of a Macedonian empire, which would grow to an unprecedented size in the reign of his son, Alexander the Great.

        "target_summary": "The Peloponnesian War, a protracted and bloody conflict spanning from 431 to 404 BC, dramatically reshaped the ancient Greek world during the fifth century BC. This monumental struggle pitted the dominant naval power of Athens and its extensive Delian League empire against the formidable land forces of Sparta and its Peloponnesian League, involving nearly every Greek state. Our primary understanding of this era comes from the meticulous writings of Thucydides, an Athenian general exiled for military failure, who became a forefather of impartial historical study. He chronicled the war, which, despite its name, extended far beyond the Peloponnese to devastate the Aegean, Sicily, and Attica.\n\nPrior to this conflict, Athens and Sparta had been unlikely allies against the Persian invasions. In the aftermath, however, their paths diverged dramatically. Athens transformed the defensive Delian League into a vast maritime empire, amassing immense wealth and power through tributes and its unparalleled fleet of triremes, while fortifying itself with formidable \"Long Walls.\" Sparta, conversely, commanded reverence through its legendary, fiercely disciplined warriors, forged by brutal training from childhood. Alarmed by Athens' escalating hegemony, Sparta led its own alliance of Peloponnesian and central Greek states, its formidable army poised against Athens' naval might.\n\nDecades of simmering tensions and proxy conflicts, often referred to as the First Peloponnesian War, had preceded the main struggle, briefly interrupted by an uneasy \"Thirty Years' Peace.\" This fragile accord shattered when Athenian aggression, including siding against Corinth and imposing a trade embargo on Megara (both Spartan allies), finally provoked Sparta into declaring war in 431 BC.\n\nSparta initially aimed to liberate Greece from Athenian \"tyranny,\" launching annual land invasions of Attica with its hoplite army. Athens, under the strategic guidance of Pericles, adopted a defensive posture, sheltering its population behind the Long Walls and relying on its superior navy to strike back. However, a devastating plague soon swept through the overcrowded city, claiming Pericles and a quarter of the Athenian populace, severely weakening its morale and leadership. Despite this catastrophic blow, Spartan campaigns suffered setbacks, and they failed to capitalize on Athens' vulnerability.\n\nWith Pericles gone, Athenian strategy became more aggressive. Generals like Demosthenes achieved successes, establishing outposts in the Peloponnese that attracted runaway helots, disrupting Spartan society. Sparta, facing these challenges, sought peace, but renewed fighting led to a Spartan victory at Amphipolis, where both Athenian leader Cleon and the distinguished Spartan general Brasidas fell. This cleared the way for the \"Peace of Nicias\" in 421 BC, a fifty-year treaty that lasted merely six, as both sides continued to undermine each other through covert means and proxy skirmishes.\n\nThe war reignited fiercely in 415 BC with Athens' ambitious, but ultimately catastrophic, Sicilian Expedition. Aiming to conquer Syracuse and its vital trade routes, the Athenian fleet suffered repeated defeats, exacerbated by the defection of their commander Alcibiades to Sparta, and Spartan aid to Syracuse. The expedition ended in utter devastation for Athens, a crippling loss of men, ships, and prestige.\n\nDespite this monumental setback, Athens remarkably rebuilt its reserve fleet and began winning naval battles, even as Sparta, aided by Persian funds, increased pressure on Attica and fueled revolts. However, the tide definitively turned when Persian gold enabled Sparta to construct a powerful fleet of its own. In 405 BC, under the brilliant command of Lysander, the Spartan navy utterly annihilated the Athenians at the Battle of Aegospotami. This decisive victory led directly to Athens' surrender in 404 BC. The triumphant Spartans imposed harsh terms: the demolition of the Long Walls, a severely restricted fleet, and enforced tribute. The once-mighty Athenian empire was dissolved, and Sparta emerged as the dominant power in Greece.\n\nSparta's newfound hegemony, however, proved brief. Entangled in too many conflicts, it was eventually defeated by Thebes in 371 BC. Nearly a century of incessant warfare and shifting alliances had left Greece fractured and vulnerable, a state expertly exploited by Philip II of Macedon, who unified the city-states and laid the foundations for the vast empire his son, Alexander the Great, would dramatically expand.",

        "content": "In popular depictions of ancient Greece, the mythical Amazons loom large. A tribe of independent, fierce and powerful warriors, their legend is inspired by real nomadic women who lived in the Eurasian Steppe   and it s very revealing about the roles women played in Greek society. For the ancients, these strong women represented a threat to the patriarchal order, and most versions of the myth see them tricked and overcome by the hero Herakles, the ultimate symbol of masculine strength. Ad For the ancient Greek ideal, you might instead look to Penelope, the wife of Odysseus in Homer's Odyssey. Beset by more than a hundred suitors, she remains calm, dedicated to her domestic duties, and, most importantly by the standard of the day, loyal to her husband. When considering the lives of ancient Greek women, though, it s important, says classicist Paul Cartledge, to distinguish between different Greek city-states. While many sources of the period come from Athens, we cannot assume that women s role in Athenian society was representative of the lives of women across the rest of Greece. The lives of Spartan women would have been very different from their Athenian sisters. EXPLORE more on this topic | Women's history Another key difference is status. While no woman would have found themselves on equal footing with men in ancient Greek society, the lives of women would have greatly depended upon how wealthy their father or husband was. Greater wealth did not necessarily mean they enjoyed greater freedom, though.  If you were a woman in Athens, the richer you were, broadly speaking, the more confined you were,  explains Cartledge. Here, we take a closer look at the different elements of women s lives in ancient Greece... In Homer s Odyssey, Penelope demonstrates her loyalty to her husband when beset by suitors. (Photo by Print Collector/Getty Images) Motherhood and the home The lives of ancient Greek women were largely confined to the home. Men would serve the polis   state   while the domain of women was the oikos   the household. The women's quarters of a house, the gynaikon, were located on the upper floors, and wives were expected to bear and raise children and undertake domestic duties. Marriage itself would usually take place when a kore (maiden) was between 13 and 15 years old; only after the birth of her first child would she technically become a gyne (woman). In ancient Greek society, the reputation of women was in all cases to be preserved. Athenian historian Thucydides, writing in the fifth century BC, famously asserted of women:  The greatest glory is to be least talked about among men, whether in praise or blame.  This meant that many wealthy Athenian women were supervised and chaperoned by male relatives when outside, and in some cases not allowed to leave the house at all. For Spartan women, however, life was different from their Athenian counterparts. They rarely married before the age of 20, while motherhood gave them enhanced status; raising future warriors was considered one of the most important roles in Spartan society. Women in Sparta (and in Delphi, Gortyn, Thessaly and Megara) could also own land, and because of military campaigns that took men away for long periods of time, they often had control of their own homes. Work Though life for Athenian women held many restrictions, religion provided a viable career path for those hailing from aristocratic backgrounds. In fact, the most senior religious office of the state   high priestess of the Athena Polias   was a female role. This, and other similar positions within Athens  religious cults, would have afforded the officeholders a certain degree of public influence, and in some cases, payment and property. There is also the story of a pioneering Athenian midwife named Agnodice. According to legend, Agnodice   concerned at the high number of local women dying in childbirth   decided to disguise herself as a man and study medicine. According to some versions of the tale, the midwife would  reveal  her true gender to patients in order to gain their trust, leading envious male doctors to accuse her of seducing pregnant women. While the existence of Agnodice is still debated by scholars, her legend has been used by women to support their role in medicine since the 17th century.  about childbirth through history, with our A-Z of midwifery and childbirth However, a more common   and certainly real   profession for many women of the time was that of sex worker. Of these, it's known that there were two particular groups of workers, called hetairai and pornai. A hetaira would have been able to read and write, and been employed to work for the higher classes in society. They would have also served as a companion   perhaps more comparable to the role of a geisha in Japanese culture. Meanwhile, pornai (from which we get the modern word 'pornography') would have spent their time working in a brothel and were expected to serve all levels of the city's men, from the elite to members of the lower classes. Education and politics Much like their greater freedoms as mothers and within the domestic sphere, Spartan women also had better access to education than their counterparts in other Greek city-states. While their early education would have taken place at home rather than in a school, women were seen as a key part of Spartan society and allowed to make business transactions. One famous example of the greater opportunities available to Spartan women (albeit noble women) concerns the fifth-century BC Spartan queen, Gorgo. The only known child of Cleomenes I, king of Sparta, Gorgo (who later married King Leonidas I) was schooled in literature, culture and physical education   the latter of which included wrestling and combat skills. Indeed, Gorgo was noted by fifth-century BC Greek historian Herodotus as a woman of great wisdom; she advised her father on military matters, and is sometimes credited as being one of history s first cryptanalysts. For Athenian women, however, there was no such freedom to participate in their city-state's political and social life. Even if they were educated in some manner of business dealings, they could not by law enter into any contract beyond the value of one medimnos of barley   a small amount that ensured any transaction was restricted to domestic purchases. And while Athens is lauded as the birthplace of democracy, Athenian women were never true  adults  in the eyes of the law. This inequality had long echoes into the 20th century; women in modern Greece didn t have the unconditional opportunity to vote until 1952. Arts and culture While women were generally excluded from the arts, one of ancient Greece s most celebrated poets was a woman named Sappho. Born in either Eressos or Mytilene on the island of Lesbos, likely to a wealthy family (given that she could read and write), Sappho s lyrics and poetry were remarkable for their candid depictions of passion and sexuality   particularly between women. The seventh-century BC poet was even dubbed by Plato as the  Tenth Muse , and honoured on ancient coins. It s also possible to find evidence of women artists, such as Kora, who was from Sicyon and active around 650 BC. Along with her artist father, Dibutades, she is credited with the invention of relief modelling. According to a popular tale, Kora fell in love with one of her father s apprentices, and traced the outline of his face in charcoal on a wall. Dibutades later filled the outline in clay, creating the first relief. Kora apparently traced the outline of her lover s face on a wall as he slept. (Photo by The Print Collector/Heritage Images via Getty Images) Another example of a woman who broke the mould was the fifth-century BC artist Timarete, who, according to the Roman author Pliny the Elder,  scorned the duties of women and practised her father s art .

        "target_summary": "Ancient Greek society presented a complex and varied landscape for women, often contrasting the fierce, independent spirit of mythical Amazons with the domestic ideal embodied by Penelope. Rather than a singular experience, women's lives differed significantly across city-states like Athens and Sparta, and by social status; paradoxically, greater wealth in Athens often meant greater confinement.\n\nIn Athens, women were largely confined to the *oikos* (household), with *gynaikon* (women's quarters) on upper floors. Marriage was typically young (13-15), followed by immediate expectations of childbearing. The Athenian ideal, as articulated by Thucydides, valued women who were \"least talked about,\" leading to strict supervision and limited public visibility for wealthier women.\n\nSpartan women, however, enjoyed striking contrasts. They married later (after 20), and motherhood, particularly raising future warriors, elevated their status. Unique among Greek women, they could own land and often managed homes independently due to men's extended military service.\n\nWhile most Athenian women were domestic, some aristocratic women found public roles as high priestesses, wielding influence and even property. The legendary midwife Agnodice, who reputedly disguised herself as a man to practice medicine, symbolizes the historical desire for women to pursue professional callings. More commonly, women worked as sex workers: the educated *hetairai* served as elite companions, while *pornai* worked in brothels for all societal levels.\n\nEducation and political participation also showed a stark divide. Spartan women received more comprehensive education, including physical training, and were permitted business transactions. Queen Gorgo exemplifies this, noted for her wisdom and military advice. Athenian women, conversely, were severely restricted. Legally unable to enter significant contracts and never considered true \"adults,\" they endured a profound lack of civic and economic freedom that stretched into modern times.\n\nDespite general societal exclusion from the arts, remarkable women broke through. Sappho, the revered poet from Lesbos, was celebrated for her evocative lyrics on passion and sexuality, earning her the title \"Tenth Muse.\" Artists like Kora, credited with inventing relief modeling, and Timarete, who defied gender norms to pursue painting, further demonstrate individual talent transcending societal limitations.",

        "title": "A brief history of sex and sexuality in Ancient Greece",
        "content": "Please note this article contains sexually explicit content Ad In the beginning was sex. To the ancient Greek mythologisers, sexuality, love and sex were inextricably connected with the creation of the earth, the heavens and the underworld. Greek myth was a theogony of incest, murder, polygamy and intermarriage in which eroticism and fertility were elemental; they were there right from the start, demonstrating woman s essential reproductive role in securing the cosmos, extending the human race and ensuring the fecundity of nature. Simultaneously, Zeus, the top god, wasted no time in asserting his dominance over the other gods (both male and female). His cavalier attitude towards female sexuality, as manifested in serial rape and seduction (Zeus raped Leda, daughter of the Aetolian king Thestius, in the guise of a swan; raped Danae, a princess of Argos, disguised as the rain, and raped Ganymede, a male mortal) set a precedent for centuries of mortal male domination and female subservience. The depiction of Hera [wife of Zeus and queen of the ancient Greek gods] as a distracting, duplicitous and deceptive woman opened the door for centuries of male insecurity about women, and misogyny.

(Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) The Minoans Our earliest evidence for ancient Greek sexuality comes with the Minoans (approximately 3650 to 1400 BC). Women at this time were only partly dressed   the main items of clothing were short-sleeved robes that had layered, flounced skirts; these were open to the navel, leaving the breasts exposed. Women also wore a strapless fitted bodice, the first fitted garments known in history. Women were typically depicted as having a tiny waist, full breasts, long hair and full hips: to our eyes and ears this is sexually charged and provocative, but to a Minoan probably not so. On the contrary, the voluptuous figure may have been a means by which women, and their artists, expressed their gender and status rather than male artists simply idealising female sexuality for their own delectation, satisfying a prurient male voyeurism. Women in Minoan Crete, it seems, were able to celebrate their femininity. The body shape described above re-emerged during the mid-late 1800s, when women laced themselves into tight corsets to make their waists small and wore hoops under their skirts to exaggerate the proportions of their lower body.

(Photo by DEA/G DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini/Getty Images) Pederasty Pederasty in Greece probably originated with the Cretans. Cretan pederasty was an early form of paedophilia that involved the ritual kidnapping (harpagmos) of a boy from an elite background by an aristocratic adult male, with the consent of the boy's father. This adult male was known as philetor, befriender; the boy was kleinos, glorious. The man took the boy out into the wilderness, where they spent two months hunting and feasting with friends learning life skills, respect and responsibility. It is generally assumed that the philetor would begin having sex with the boy soon after taking him out into the wilds. If the boy was pleased with how this went he changed his status from kleinos to parastates, or comrade, signifying that he had metaphorically fought in battle alongside his philetor; he then went back to society and lived with him. The philetor would shower the boy with expensive gifts, including an army uniform, an ox to be sacrificed to Zeus, and a drinking goblet   a symbol of spiritual accomplishment. At the same time, according to the geographer Strabo, the boy then had to choose between continuing with or putting an end to the relationship with his abductor, and whether to denounce the man if he had misbehaved in any way. Satyrs and satyriasis Satyrs, depicted in Greek mythology as beast-like men with a horse s tail, donkey s ears, upturned pug nose, receding hairline and erect penis, have a reputation for being inveterate masturbators with a penchant for rape, sodomy and necrophilia. A satyr was a true party animal with an insatiable passion for dancing, women and wine. Satyrs were experts on the aulos, a phallic-shaped double reed instrument; some vase paintings show satyrs ejaculating while playing, and one even shows a bee deftly avoiding the discharge in mid-flight. Another vase illustrates a hirsute satyr masturbating while shoving a dildo of sorts into his anus. Apart from inspiring some wonderful depictions on ceramics, satyrs have left us the word satyriasis, which means hypersexuality   classified today in the World Health Organisation s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) as satyriasis in men and as nymphomania in women (in 1951 it was still listed as a  sexual deviation ). The word satyriasis appears frequently in the works of medical authors of the Roman empire who describe a condition no doubt prevalent for centuries previously. For example, Soranus contends that the  itching  felt in the genitals that makes women  touch themselves  increases their sexual urge and causes  mental derangement  and an immodest desire for a man. Greek physician Galen called it  uterine fury , furor uterinus. Statue of Silenus, a satyr and minor god of drunkenness, dated from 540-530 BC. National Archaeological Museum, Athens, Greece. (Photo by Prisma/UIG/Getty Images) Achilles and Briseis Epic [the Iliad] gives us one of our earliest surviving expressions of heterosexual love; it comes from a rather surprising source   from battle-hardened, Homeric war hero, alpha male Achilles. Achilles uncharacteristically wears his heart on his sleeve when he reveals how much he loves Briseis in Book 9 of the Iliad, referring to her as if she were his wife. The beautiful and intelligent Briseis first encountered Achilles when he ruthlessly slaughtered her father, mother, three brothers and husband during a Greek assault on Troy, before taking her as war booty. Achilles wiped out Briseis  family so that she was utterly bereft and had only him to focus on. To Achilles it was simply the right and decent thing to do to love your woman   an attitude, of course, that may have been at odds with some of the male audience members of Homer s epic over the years. Masturbation To the ancient Greeks masturbation was a normal and healthy substitute for other sexual pleasures   a handy  safety valve  against destructive sexual frustration. This may explain why there are so few references to it in the literature: it was common practice and did not merit much attention. Nevertheless, it may well have been deemed, publicly at least, to be the preserve of slaves, lunatics and other people considered to be lower down the social pecking order. Elite opinion would have regarded it, literally, as a waste of time and semen, since it was one of the prime cultural responsibilities of the Greek male to further the family line and extend the oikos, the household. One term for masturbation in ancient Greece was anaphlao, a verb that comic playwright Aristophanes disparagingly used to describe the Spartans, who were  wankers , in his comedy Lysistrata. The decidedly odd Greek philosopher Diogenes the Cynic routinely masturbated in public and defended his actions by saying  If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly . Interestingly, Diogenes attracted censure not just for masturbating in public but also for eating in the agora   indicating perhaps that masturbating in a public place was regarded as no more serious a crime than eating in a public place. Other ancient civilisations celebrated masturbation too. For example, a clay figurine of the 4th millennium BC from Malta shows a woman masturbating. In ancient Sumer [the first ancient urban civilization in the historical region of southern Mesopotamia, modern-day southern Iraq] masturbation   either solitary or with a partner   was thought to enhance potency. In ancient Egypt male masturbation when performed by a god was considered a creative or magical act: Atum was said to have created the universe by masturbating, and the ebb and flow of the Nile was attributed to the frequency of his ejaculations. Egyptian Pharaohs were required to masturbate ceremonially into the Nile. Effeminacy and cross-dressing Effeminacy in men was considered beyond the pale   para phusin or  outside nature . It implied passivity and receptiveness, epithumein paschein   both weaknesses contrary to the proper sexual conduct of the Greek male who ought to be virile, dominant, penetrating and thrusting. Cross-dressing had some surprising advocates. The heroic alpha-male Hercules, according to the Roman poet Ovid, indulged in a bout of cross-dressing with Omphale [queen of Lydia to whom Hercules was enslaved] Hercules put on Omphale s clothes and Omphale dressed up in typically Herculean lion skin and wealded his club, which was symbolic of manhood and power. Surprisingly, perhaps,  lion-hearted  Achilles too was not averse to a spot of dressing up in women s clothes, if it saved him from the call-up for the Trojan war. Hercules and Omphale. Hercules was sold as a slave to Omphale, queen of Lydia, to atone for the murder of Iphitos. Hercules was forced to wear Omphale's clothes and jewellery. (Photo by Imagno/Getty Images) Pseudo-Apollodorus, in the Bibliotheca [a compendium of Greek myths and heroic legends], tells us that to help her son dodge the draft Thetis [Achilles  mother] concealed him at the court of Lycomedes, king of Skyros. Disguised as a girl Achilles lived among Lycomedes' daughters under the pseudonym Pyrrha, the red-haired girl. Achilles raped one of the daughters, Deidamia, and with her fathered a son, Neoptolemus. Odysseus was told by the prophet Calchas that the Greeks would not capture Troy without Achilles' support, so he went to Skyros masquerading as a peddler selling women's clothes and jewellery with a shield and spear secreted in his wares. Achilles instantly took up the spear; Odysseus saw through his disguise as Pyrrha and persuaded him to join the Greek forces. Another famous alpha male, Julius Caesar, was also involved in cross-dressing: apparently, aged 20, he lived the life of a girl in the court of King Nicomedes IV and was later referred to behind his back as the 'queen of Bithynia', and  every woman's man and every man's woman . Suetonius described his long-fringed sleeves and loose belt as a bit odd, prompting statesman and dictator Sulla to warn everyone to  beware of the boy with the loose belt .

        "target_summary": "Ancient Greek culture, from its mythical origins, deeply intertwined sexuality, love, and creation. The very fabric of the cosmos, according to mythologisers, was a sprawling tapestry of divine passions, where incest, murder, and fertility were primal forces, underscoring woman's essential role in perpetuating life. Zeus, the dominant god, often asserted his power through serial rape and seduction, famously transforming into a swan for Leda or rain for Danaë. This cavalier divine precedent, alongside Hera's portrayal as duplicitous, cemented male dominance and fueled centuries of misogyny.\n\nOur earliest glimpses into ancient Greek sexuality emerge with the Minoans (3650-1400 BC). Minoan women were often depicted in striking attire: open-fronted, flounced skirts exposing their breasts and fitted bodices accentuating tiny waists, full breasts, and hips. While provocative to modern eyes, these voluptuous figures likely celebrated femininity and expressed gender and status, rather than merely catering to male voyeurism.\n\nCretan pederasty, an early form of paedophilia, marked a complex social ritual. It involved the \"harpagmos,\" a sanctioned kidnapping of an elite boy by an aristocratic adult male (the \"philetor\") with the father's consent. This two-month period of wilderness living, hunting, and feasting was presumed to include sexual intimacy. If content, the boy transitioned from \"kleinos\" (glorious) to \"parastates\" (comrade), re-entering society with his philetor, showered with symbolic gifts, yet retaining agency to end the relationship or denounce his abductor.\n\nGreek mythology also teems with the hedonistic Satyrs: beast-like men notorious for their insatiable passions for wine, dancing, and women, coupled with a penchant for masturbation, rape, sodomy, and necrophilia. Often depicted in graphic acts on ceramics, Satyrs left a linguistic legacy: \"satyriasis\" for male hypersexuality, contrasted with \"nymphomania\" for women, once deemed a \"sexual deviation.\" Roman medical texts vividly described this \"uterine fury\" in women, linking it to intense urges.\n\nBeyond the mythical, ancient texts reveal nuanced views on human sexuality. The *Iliad*, surprisingly, offers one of the earliest portrayals of heterosexual love from the formidable Achilles for Briseis, whom he had taken as war-booty after slaughtering her family. His declaration, treating her \"as if she were his wife,\" reveals a complex ancient intersection of devotion and conquest.\n\nMasturbation, often a hidden topic, was considered a normal, healthy \"safety valve\" against sexual frustration in ancient Greece. While perhaps publicly associated with lower classes or viewed as a \"waste of semen\" by elites prioritizing procreation, figures like Diogenes the Cynic famously asserted its naturalness by public masturbation. Other ancient civilizations, like Sumer and Egypt, revered it as a creative or magical act, with Egyptian pharaohs ceremonially masturbating into the Nile, linking it to the river's life-giving flow.\n\nFinally, while effeminacy in men was generally scorned as \"outside nature\" and a sign of passive weakness, cross-dressing surprisingly featured in the narratives of heroic alpha-males. Hercules, to atone for murder, wore Omphale's clothes while she wielded his club, symbolizing a powerful role reversal. Even \"lion-hearted\" Achilles disguised himself as a girl to evade the Trojan War draft, an act ironically leading to the rape of Lycomedes' daughter. And Julius Caesar was rumored to have lived as a \"girl\" in King Nicomedes' court, earning him a derogatory nickname. These narratives unveil a surprisingly fluid aspect to gender expression, defying strict societal norms.",

Ad Follow the links below to jump to the highlights in each section: Who is Alexander the Great? Alexander III of Macedon, known to most as Alexander the Great, inherited his kingdom (in modern-day Greece) at the age of 20, following the assassination of his father, Philip II, in 336 BC. After suppressing his enemies on home soil, Alexander moved quickly to reassert Macedonian power in Greece and to conquer the Persian empire, achieving victories across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt without suffering a single defeat. The next eight years of campaigning saw him create an empire that stretched across three continents and covered around two million square miles   south into Egypt and as far east as the Indian Punjab. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history s most successful military commanders   but died in his prime at Babylon in June 323 BC, just before his 33rd birthday. Alternate history: what if Alexander the Great had lived longer? Professor Paul Cartledge considers whether an older Alexander the Great could have formed an even bigger empire or grown even more impressive reputation... Alexander the Great: the big questions answered Paul Cartledege, AG Leventis Professor of Greek Culture Emeritus at the University of Cambridge, gives us his take on Alexander the Great... What made Alexander the Great such a brilliant military leader? He combined immense personal charisma and bravery (he often led his troops from the front). Plus he had a priceless ability to identify the key moment in a battle and act decisively to ensure he won that moment. Where does Alexander the Great stand in the pantheon of great commanders? Up there in Division 1, with Napoleon and Genghis Khan. He won the four key battles of his great campaign: at Granicus, Issus, Gaugamela and, for me the most impressive, Hydaspes. While Darius III of Persia commanded a motley crew of multi-ethnic forces, at Hydaspes Raja Porus led largely Indian ethnic forces fighting on their own terrain for their own terrain. And, of course, they had elephants! What was Alexander the Great s greatest failing as a leader? One criticism is that he didn t invest enough time and energy in the peaceful administration of his diverse empire. One symptom is that, at his death in 323 BC, he had three wives but no male heir yet born. In addition, he was too impetuous, too prone to believe alleged conspiracies against his life and too trusting in subordinates who let him down. Was Alexander the Great gay? As he had sex with both males and females, he was what we d call bisexual. He married three times and sired at least two sons, one legitimate (born to his first wife, Roxana, after his death). Possibly his closest and warmest personal relationship was with a man   his near-contemporary Hephaestion, a noble Macedonian who, like him, was taught by Aristotle. A brief history of sex and sexuality in Ancient Greece Paul Chrystal explores the many layers of sex and sexuality in various Greek societies   from prostitution to pillow talk... What motivated Alexander the Great to undertake his extraordinary campaign in the east? It probably never occurred to him not to carry on where his father had been forced to leave off. Probably, too, his Greek-style education and his love of Homer s writings gave him the notion of trying to emulate his boyhood hero, Achilles (the mythical Trojan War was, after all, a battle between Greeks and Orientals). Did Alexander the Great truly believe he was a god? Without doubt he believed he was descended literally from more than one god, and he almost certainly demanded to be worshipped by his subjects as if he were himself a living god. Was he a megalomaniac? Yes, inevitably. No one but a megalomaniac could possibly have conceived, let alone pulled off, his greatest feats. Alexander the Great: his life in 17 moments Understand why Alexander the Great casts such as shadow in history with writer Spencer Day's highlights of his life... 20/21 July 356 BC | Alexander the Great is born He is born in the Macedonian capital of Pella. His father is the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his mother is the politically ambitious Olympias of Epirus. 343 BC | Alexander begins his education with Aristotle Alexander travels to the Temple of the Nymphs in Mieza to be educated by the celebrated Greek philosopher Aristotle. There he develops a fascination with the exploits of mythical Greek heroes such as Achilles. October 336 BC | Alexander becomes king of Macedon Philip II is assassinated by his bodyguard while attending wedding celebrations in Aegae. Alexander   who has since come under suspicion for ordering the killing   becomes king of Macedon in his father s stead. May 334 BC | Alexander crosses the Hellespont With an army about 50,000 strong, Alexander crosses the Hellespont to Asia Minor. His goal: to seize Persia and become the master of Asia. May 334 BC | Alexander visits Troy Alexander journeys to the town made famous by Homer s epic poem the Iliad, to pay his respects to some of the heroes he believes are buried there, among them Achilles. May 334 BC | The battle of the Granicus The Persian king, Darius III, sends an army to confront the Macedonians on the banks of the Granicus river. Alexander secures victory following an audacious cavalry charge into the heart of the enemy   which he leads himself. 5 November 333 BC | The battle of Issus Darius attacks Alexander near Issus. The Persian army fares no better than at Granicus   a whirlwind Greek cavalry assault proves decisive and Darius flees the battlefield. 332 BC | Divine intervention at Siwa Oasis After leading a party of men in a perilous journey across the Saharan desert, Alexander visits the oracle at the Siwa Oasis, where he asks her if he is the son of the god Amon. He later suggests that she answered in the affirmative. July 332 BC | The storming of Tyre In a masterclass of ingenuity and resolve, Alexander storms Tyre following a seven-month siege, which had seen his men build a half-mile-long causeway out to the island. He then oversees the slaughter of 8,000 of the city s inhabitants. 331 BC | The founding of Alexandria Alexander founds Alexandria on Egypt s north coast. The city goes on to become one of the Mediterranean s most important ports. Today nearly five million people call it home 1 October 331 BC | The battle of Gaugamela Darius brings an enormous army to the field near Gaugamela in modern Iraq. What follows is the decisive battle in Alexander s conquest of Persia. Though Alexander s army is perhaps less than half the size of its Persian foe, the Macedonian troops  superior training and resolve   not to mention their commander s peerless tactical agility   prevails once more. Darius flees the battlefield again. But this time there is no reprieve: soon after, he is slaughtered by his own men. 330 BC | The looting of Persepolis The Macedonian army descends on the Persian capital of Persepolis and, in an orgy of drink-fuelled violence, loots the city and burns its great palace to the ground 327 BC | The siege of Aornos In another masterclass of improvisation, Alexander seizes Aornos, a seemingly impregnable stronghold blocking his entry into India. Alexander s solution is to seize the hill opposite and drive the enemy out of their encampment with his catapults May 326 BC | The battle of the Hydaspes The powerful Indian raja Porus confronts the Macedonians on the banks of the river Hydaspes. In an incredibly hard-fought battle, Alexander s phalanx gets the better of an Indian army that includes 200 elephants. Hydaspes is the last great battle of Alexander s campaign in the east   but it is also the bloodiest, pushing the Macedonian army to breaking point 326 BC | Alexander's men mutiny Drenched by Indian monsoon rains and traumatised by the carnage at Hydaspes, Alexander s men decide they have had enough and mutiny. Eight years and 17,000 miles into his epic journey east, Alexander is forced to accept that his remarkable campaign of conquest is over 324 BC | The second mutiny Troops mutiny again at Opis (roughly modern Baghdad): faced with insurrection, Alexander cashiers 10,000 of his mainly Macedonian troops and stages a huge banquet of reconciliation. 323 BC | Alexander the Great dies Alexander passes at Babylon: his cause of death is unclear; some theories suggest that he was assassinated by poison. Alexander the Great's Empire How did a young king from Macedon inspire his modest army to conquer a domain that spanned the ancient world? Writer Jeremy Pound reveals the secrets behind the man   and his downfall When, on 1 October 331 BC, Alexander III of Macedon faced the massed Persian forces of Darius III at Gaugamela, the outcome should have been a foregone conclusion. Comprising 34,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry, Alexander s Greek army was by no means small   but Darius commanded a mighty cavalry numbering 34,000 and, it is reckoned, more than 200,000 infantry. What s more, the hot and dusty plain   in what is now northern Iraq   was home turf for the Persians. Alexander s men, in contrast, had been on the march for over three years and were over a thousand miles from home. In fact, the battle was indeed a rout   but not in the expected way. It was the Persians who were crushed, not the numerically inferior Greeks. We will never know the exact figures, but it s believed that around 50,000 Persians were killed in the battle, compared with just 1,000 or so Greeks. With his vast forces in disarray, Darius fled. He survived   for now   but his reign was effectively finished, as was the once-great Persian empire, which had stretched from Libya in the west to the Indus Valley in the east. The way now lay open for Alexander to press on eastwards and establish his own empire. At just 25, he was the most powerful man in the world   the Great, indeed. Brilliant military tactician, savvy politician, courageous and accomplished fighter   in terms of leadership skills, Alexander had the lot. Nor did it hurt to be the son of a king who had already set in motion the most significant shift in power in Greek history. Peloponnesian War: Athens fights Sparta Read about another major shift in power   the 5th century BC Peloponnesian War between the Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues. Here's why the war began, who won and how, and why it prompted a reshaping of the Hellenic world... Alexander the Great's early life and reign Alexander was born in July 356 BC to King Philip II of Macedon   by all accounts a thoroughly unpleasant man, but also a mightily effective leader. In the space of just a few years, Philip transformed his state from a small, peripheral kingdom in northern Greece into an unstoppable war machine. In 339 BC, he won a crushing victory over Athens and its allies at Chaeronea, ensuring that Macedon effectively ruled all Greece. Alexander won his spurs fighting alongside his father, earning plaudits for his bravery at Chaeronea, but would himself soon have the opportunity to rule. Suspiciously soon, in fact   it s been suggested by some historians that Alexander might have been behind the assassination of Philip II in 336 BC, killed by one of his own bodyguards at a family wedding. By fair means or foul, at the age of 20, Alexander III became ruler of Greece   and the ruthlessness he displayed in cementing that position bore all the hallmarks of his father. He put down unrest in the north of his kingdom with brutal speed and, when Thebes rashly declared independence from Macedonia, his reprisal was savage: the city was burnt to the ground, its people either slaughtered or sold into slavery. But Alexander was not merely ruthless. He was also bright enough to know that brute force alone would not keep the diverse collection of states under his power in check. If his study of history had taught him anything   and, with the philosopher and scientist Aristotle as his teacher, he would certainly have been well schooled   it would have been that nothing unites states and their people more than having a reviled common enemy. In 490 BC and 480 BC, the Greeks, who had been fighting among themselves, had joined forces to repel invasions by the Persians under Darius I and Xerxes I. Now, a century and a half later, Alexander saw an opportunity to turn the tables, and planned a united Greek invasion of Persia. The expedition that began in spring 334 BC, when Alexander s forces set off from the Greek mainland, would change the course of history. It was not just his military victories against the odds that defy belief, but also his achievements in overcoming daunting geographical obstacles   from vast African deserts to the precipitous mountain trails of the Hindu Kush in the western Himalaya   in a journey that would eventually cover about 20,000 miles over the course of 11 years. The initial impetus and rallying call for the expedition may have been that long-held grudge against the Persians, but Alexander also had an ulterior motive: he was determined to reach the end of the Earth and the great ocean that he believed lay beyond. Certainly, no one could accuse him of a lack of ambition. Alexander the Great Before the Tomb of Achilles. Found in the collection of Louvre, Paris. (Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Early conquests Alexander s all-conquering tour began when he crossed into Asia Minor (Anatolia, today part of Turkey) before heading down the eastern Mediterranean coast through Syria into Egypt, looping back towards the Red Sea then continuing eastward through Assyria   where he triumphed at Gaugamela   Mesopotamia, Persia and Bactria, and through the Hindu Kush to the Indus River. If those ancient names seem unfamiliar, look in a modern atlas and tally the list of countries his army traversed to get an idea of the enormity of the achievement: Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, India. Alexander s forces triumphed in a succession of major battles, not all of them as quick and decisive as Gaugamela. The crucial Mediterranean port city of Tyre (now in Lebanon) was conquered only after a siege that lasted seven months. Cities galore were founded en route, from Alexandria in Egypt (today, the country s second biggest city) to Alexandria Eschate ( Alexandria the Farthest ) in Tajikistan and Alexandria Bucephalus, named for the Macedonian s beloved horse, in what s now the Pakistani Punjab. The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: what happened to them? As the pinnacle of antiquity s ability in engineering, architecture and artistic beauty, the seven wonders of the ancient world still cast their shadow over human endeavour today. And one of them was in Alexandria... Not everyone met Alexander s army with stern resistance. Many welcomed their conqueror with open arms and, often, lavish gifts. All, however, soon became part of an empire of unprecedented scope   covering over two million square miles, it linked East with West for the first time in history. Enclaves of Greek culture persist in remote areas of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent even today, legacies of the Macedonian s exploits over two millennia ago. No figure from ancient history continues to loom so large in the literature and culture of so many different peoples   in many he is deified, in many others he is utterly reviled. But how did he do it? How did Alexander inspire and maintain allegiance and endurance in his troops as he led them on an expedition that, at times, must have seemed not just ambitious but downright deluded? Providing the military brains behind unlikely victories such as that at Gaugamela helped   everyone likes to be on the side of a winner, particularly one who is seemingly invincible. Nor was Alexander the sort of general to monitor success from afar. Various sources depict him fighting courageously on the frontline. Alexander knew all about the effectiveness of what today is dubbed  shock and awe . The shock was simple enough   if you crossed him, he was merciless. Alexander s path across Asia was a bloody one, strewn with the bodies not just of enemies but also of former friends whom he came to mistrust, and even the likes of doctors and priests whom he believed had let him down. The awe, meanwhile, came from creating an aura of one directed from above, encouraging the belief that his rise towards global domination was preordained. To that end, he employed tactics designed to convince all around him of his credentials. The Greeks were a suspicious and religious bunch, so Alexander made a point of consulting oracles   which would inevitably confirm that his actions enjoyed divine approval; he even undertook a perilous eight-day trek across the desert to the oracle at Siwa in Egypt. And Alexander s propagandist Callisthenes was invariably there to elaborate, enhance and disseminate the news far and wide. Much of the success of the Alexander  myth  is down to the handiwork of Callisthenes   an exceptional spin doctor   from the famous account of loosening the Gordian Knot to the touching tales of Alexander s bond with Bucephalus. Many people were led to believe that Alexander was, indeed, a god. End of the road Eventually, though, even the most successful conqueror meets his nemesis. Alexander s came in the form of the River Ganges. By 326 BC, long years on the road and battle losses   not to mention tropical diseases and venomous snakes   had taken their toll on his troops. Faced with the prospect of crossing a threemile- wide torrent, only to face more of the same tribulations on the other side, Alexander s army refused. The great adventure was over. The return journey from the subcontinent was not pretty. The weary Greeks saw their numbers depleted first by flash floods and then, cruelly, a horrendous drought. As for their leader, his once razor-sharp mind became increasingly erratic. He drank more: 24-hour binges became a familiar part of his routine   followed, of course, by a couple of days of hangover. Unsurprisingly, plots against him began to simmer. In autumn 324 BC, Alexander s closest companion (and, some claim, lover) Hephaestion died   possibly of typhus fever or typhoid exacerbated by heavy alcohol consumption. Devastated, Alexander declined rapidly. He reached Babylon in spring 323 BC, and in June took to his sick bed. His condition worsened and within days he was dead, aged just 32. Was it a fever that killed him, or had his liver simply given up? Perhaps he was poisoned? He was, after all, not short of enemies. Alexander the Great never made it home to Macedon. But then he never intended to. As the greatest military leader in ancient history, he left a monumental legacy: his vast Asian empire. Alexander the Great: personality and godliness Historian Paul Cartledge looks into the personality of the 4th-century BC military genius to discover what drove him to create a huge empire covering three continents... Alexander the Great had no low opinion of himself. That s not surprising given that the 4th-century BC ruler had conquered most of the known world before he had even reached the age of 30. Nevertheless, he appears to have been aware of the value of self-promotion, so besides his armies of soldiers he employed a small army of writers and artists to project the image of himself that he wanted to disseminate to the world at large. Hardly anything of those original writings survives today, unfortunately   though we do have the works of ancient Greek and Roman historians and biographers such as Curtius Rufus, Arrian and Plutarch who themselves had access to the lost texts by Ptolemy, Aristoboulus, Nearchus and others. On the other hand, large numbers of portrait coins and medallions and sculptures do survive intact, some contemporary or near-contemporary, so that we have a very good idea of the impression Alexander wished to create for his many hundreds of thousands of subjects scattered from what is today Greece (including Macedonia) in the west, as far east as what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan. One thing is very striking about all these various images. They all aim to elevate Alexander not only above the common herd of ordinary men, but above the status of the merely mortal altogether: to the status of a semi divine hero or even a god. Scholars argue as to whether Alexander sent down a formal decree from Babylon (in Iraq), one of his several capitals, actually ordering his subjects to worship him as a god. But there is no question but that he was indeed worshipped as a living god, by Greeks as well as by Orientals, and there is every likelihood that Alexander wanted to be so worshipped. This was not unprecedented, because Alexander s father Philip had already been granted divine worship as a living god. And anything Philip could do, Alexander could do better; it s arguable that rivalry with his father was one of the biggest psychological motivating forces in all Alexander s major projects, and one of the most powerful influences on his personality. Who influenced Alexander the Great? Philip II was, according to one contemporary historian, the most remarkable man Europe had produced. He raised his kingdom of Macedon from a small player on the Greek scene to the major protagonist and arbiter of the Greek world. A man of violent temper and ferocious ambition, Philip fell out with Alexander s mother Olympias (a Greek princess) quite early on. Alexander perhaps therefore became something of a mummy s boy   not in the sense that he was ever a timid, coddled wimp, but in the sense that his powerfully ambitious mother saw Alexander as a key weapon in her struggle with Philip, and the instrument whereby she could become not just another of Philip s seven wives, but queen mother, mother of the heir apparent and eventually mother of the Macedonian king. Alexander, who admired Philip but also envied his achievements, was probably happy to go along with her   perhaps even to the extent of conniving with her at Philip s public assassination at Aegae in 336. However, Alexander did once quip that the highly-strung Olympias made him pay a high rent for the nine months she had housed him in her womb. Apart from his parents, there were two great influences on his life from boyhood. One was the great Thessalian stallion Bucephalas, whom Alexander himself tamed and from whom he was pretty much inseparable from at least his early teens until the death of the great horse, aged about 30, in Pakistan in 326. So moved was Alexander by his loss that he actually named one of his new city foundations after him, in the Indus valley. The other was Alexander s boyhood comrade Hephaestion. He came from an elite Macedonian family, and was among the close group of comrades who had the privilege of being taught with Alexander by the philosopher Aristotle at Mieza, to the west of the Macedonian capital of Pella. Hephaestion was a bit older, and a bit taller, than Alexander, and it is probable that at some stage their relationship was more than platonic.

(Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) Yet for Alexander sexual gratification was apparently not that important.  Sex and sleep  he is said to have remarked,  are the only two things that remind me I m mortal . Or, as his best surviving historian Arrian (a Greek from Asia Minor writing in the second century AD) put it, warfare and military exploits gave Alexander the sort of thrill that others derived from sexual conquest. Not that Alexander was a monk; he is said to have had sex even with a mythical Amazon queen, and to have fathered a child with his beautiful Sogdian bride Roxane (from what is today Uzbekistan). He allegedly had affairs with the Persian wife of a dangerous Greek opponent fighting on the Persian side, and a liaison with a Persian eunuch. What s striking is that his preferred sexual partners were mainly Oriental rather than Greek or Macedonian. Philip is said to have fought his wars by marriages, that is by concluding diplomatic marriage alliances as a way to secure a victory, or as an alternative to fighting in order to decide the issue of territorial control. Alexander preferred to settle disputes by fighting, on the whole. However, even he took three wives, the other two besides Roxane both being Persian princesses. Alexander the Great away from the battlefield When Alexander was not fighting, there was nothing he loved to do more, for relaxation, than hunt. Big game hunting, that is   wild boar and lions; not child s play quarries like hares or doves. In Macedon there were two tests of manhood: killing a wild boar and killing a man in battle. Alexander had passed both of those by the time he was sixteen, besides hunting the wild mountain lions and sharp-eyed lynxes that still abounded in the western Macedonian upland country. Bucephalas served Alexander no less faithfully as his hunting mount than as his number one warhorse. When the going got tough on campaign (as it did in Iran, Afghanistan and central Asia after he had defeated Great King Darius III of Persia and taken his crown) a reward for any success was a day s hunting in a game park. In one of these hunting sprees near modern Samarkand, no fewer than 4,000 animals were allegedly slaughtered. It is the same dedicated hunter s mentality that made Alexander ruthless in pursuit of all his goals. Historians have argued since antiquity over what might have been Alexander s ultimate goal, had he not died prematurely (and probably of a malarial or typhoid fever rather than by an assassin s poison-bearing hand) at Babylon in 323 aged just 32. One theory takes us back to our starting point, to his self-projection as more than merely mortal. Certainly, he was religious, even superstitious, a trait he seems to have inherited or at any rate could easily have learned from his mother. How did Alexander the Great die? Aslo, where is Alexander the Great buried, and has his tomb actually been found? Professor Paul Cartledge gives his view... He relied especially heavily on the guidance of his personal diviner, Aristander, a Greek from Telmissus in what is now southwestern Turkey. Aristander s interpretation of portents such as the behaviour of birds could mean life or death for Alexander s supposed friends no less than his sworn enemies. Consultation of oracular shrines was a fixed part of Alexander s routine. Apollo s seat at Delphi in central Greece was hardly out of his way in 336, and the priestess there was made to prophesy that he would be invincible. But the trip to the oasis of Siwa in Egypt s western desert in 332, a dangerous journey over several hundred waterless and dust ridden kilometres, was a different proposition. Alexander gravely announced that the oracle s presiding deity Ammon, whom the Greeks often identified with their Zeus, had promised him his heart s desire. But what that was has to be inferred from his subsequent behaviour. It was something to do with the truth about his origins; the oracle seems to have confirmed Alexander in his belief that he had been born the son of a god, rather than a mortal. Not all his closest companions were as enamoured as he was of the notion that Philip was just Alexander s  so-called father . Nor did they all follow Hephaestion s lead in paying to Alexander the kind of public adoration that they thought was appropriate only for a true Olympian divinity. Persians too had not been in the habit of recognising their Great King as a living god but had seen him rather as the vicar on earth of the great god of light Ahura Mazda. Some of Alexander s Oriental subjects, on the other hand, such as the Egyptians, would have thought less of him as their king if he had not been the recipient of divine worship. So, as well as being one of the major drivers of his personality, Alexander s intimations of godhead could easily have been one of the major causes of dissension at the heart of his mixed Greek-Oriental court. Posterity has generally been more kind to Alexander, variously venerating or indeed worshipping him as a saint as well as a wonder-working holy man and military hero. Within the sphere of recent critical scholarship, however, a distinct note of hostility can be detected, influenced perhaps by contemporary experience of bloodshed in regions such as Afghanistan and Iraq that Alexander himself once traversed. Those scholars who see Alexander as little but a natural-born killer might bear in mind the words of the American poet Robert Lowell, in his poem The Death of Alexander: \"No one was like him. Terrible were his crimes   but if you wish to blackguard the Great King, think how mean, obscure, and dull you are, your labors lowly and your merits less...\" 6 things you (probably) didn t know about Alexander the Great Author Jennifer Macaire shares six surprising facts about the Macedonian conqueror... Alexander played polo Legend has it that when Alexander the Great was about to invade Persia in 334 BC, the Persian king Darius III sent him a polo mallet and ball. It s thought that this gesture was either inviting the Macedonian to a game, or he was suggesting that Alexander should  stick to games and avoid war . Whatever the intention, Alexander is said to have replied:  I am the stick and the ball is the Earth    before going on to conquer Persia. Polo, one of the oldest sports in the world, likely originated somewhere in Central Asia. Mounted nomads played a version of polo that was part sport, part training for war, with as many as 100 men on a side. If its origins are obscure, there is ample evidence of the game s regal place in the history of Asia: the game followed the nomads  migration to Persia sometime between 600 BC and 100 AD and the Persians adopted polo as their national sport, where it was played by nobles and soldiers alike. Some stories say Alexander the Great spent time with the Persian royal family when he was young, accompanying his father on diplomatic missions. Alexander most likely saw polo games on his many forays into Persia, and perhaps even played the  sport of kings . He may have gone underwater in a diving bell A 14th-century illustration showing Alexander the Great in a diving bell lowered from a small boat. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Almost immediately after his death in 323 BC, legends began to spread about Alexander the Great s exploits and life which, over the centuries, became increasingly fantastic as well as allegorical. Collectively, this tradition is called the Alexander Romance and the stories feature such episodes as Alexander ascending through the air to paradise; journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble; and voyaging through the  Land of Darkness  in search of the  Fountain of Youth . Writing attributed to the Greek philosopher Aristotle references a diving bell, describing a cauldron forced straight down into water, thus keeping the air within it. In fact, it s possible that Alexander the Great saw, or was perhaps even in, a glass diving bell. There are stories about him visiting the bottom of the ocean in a glass ball during his famous siege of Tyre (Lebanon), where it is said Alexander used divers to remove underwater obstacles from the harbour, and that the divers used crude glass diving bells. These may very well be just legends, but it is conceivable that Alexander, who was curious to learn about everything, had a go in a glass diving bell himself. We almost certainly know what he looked like The Azara herm is a Roman copy of a bust of Alexander the Great that was almost certainly made by the Greek sculptor Lysippus. According to the Greek writer Plutarch, Alexander made Lysippus his  official  portrait artist during his reign. Thanks to its original inscription, this figure can be definitely identified as Alexander the Great, son of Philip II of Macedon. The Azara herm, a Roman copy of a bust of Alexander the Great, thought to be by the Greek sculptor Lysippus. (Photo by: PHAS/UIG via Getty Images) Since the Azara herm is a Roman copy made centuries after Alexander s death, it is likely not as precise as the original. The bust was unearthed in 1779 during an excavation at Tivoli, Italy, organised by Joseph Nicolas Azara (1730 1804), the Spanish ambassador to the Holy See (and, later, to France). Azara presented the sculpture to Napoleon Bonaparteas a diplomatic gift. Today it resides in the Louvre museum in Paris. For a time, this was the only known portrait of Alexander the Great, and it is generally regarded as the surviving portrait that looks the most like him. Much of Plutarch's famous writings about Alexander the Great can be considered fiction The Greek writer Plutarch wrote Parallel Lives, his series of biographies of famous Greeks and Romans, in pairs: his famous biography of Alexander is paired with Julius Caesar. However, Plutarch s reliability as a biographer is questionable. He lived 400 years after Alexander the Great and contemporary writings were scarce. Plutarch was also Greek and the Greeks saw Alexander as an  upstart barbarian : firstly, because of historic snobbery (anyone non-Greek was considered a  barbarian ); and secondly, because the Greeks still resented the Macedonians who, under Alexander s father, had conquered Greece through battles and diplomacy. Plutarch begins his biography by saying he s not writing  history , but rather  a life story , because, he goes on to explain, it s better to get to know a person from his character and his jokes than from endless battles fought and won. He pretends to glorify Alexander beyond reason, writing:  On his father s side, he was descended from Hercules . However, since Alexander himself had claimed the title of  son of Zeus , Plutarch was definitely trying to take him down a peg. Nevertheless, Plutarch s biography does include some fascinating titbits of information, such as his claim that the battle of Gaugamela (the decisive battle Alexander the Great fought against Persia in 331 BC) was fought during an eclipse. He also describes how Alexander the Great spent the night before the battle in his tent with his diviner, Aristander, performing certain mysterious ceremonies and sacrificing to the god Fear. Alexander's the Great's favourite military tactic was the phalanx A relief depicting a Macedonian phalanx, Thessaloniki, Greece. (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images) The phalanx   a rectangular mass military formation made up of closely ranked troops   was a formidable fighting machine. The spears used by soldiers in a phalanx were long   sometimes as long as five metres   and made of sharpened wood or metal-tipped wood. The tactic was perfected by Alexander s father, Philip, who first learned of it after observing Greek armies. According to the Greek historian Arrian s Anabasis written in the second century AD:  Alexander drew up his army in such a way that the depth of the phalanx was 120 men; and [ ] he ordered them to preserve silence, in order to receive the word of command quickly.  Macedonian author Polyaenus (in Stratagemata, also in the second century AD) says that Alexander spitefully made his men who had not fought bravely enough in battle wear the so-called hemithorakion   a half armour system that only covered the front part of the body. This punitive experiment made sure that the soldiers wouldn t turn their backs on the enemy. However, in reality the soldiers in a phalanx would actually not require much armour   coordinated, fast movement was what made the phalanx so effective. Polyaenus describes the Macedonian infantrymen of the phalanx as being armed with helmets (kranos); light shields (pelte); greaves (knemides) and a long pike (sarissa)   notice that armour is conspicuously missing from this list. But while Alexander the Great led one of the most successful armies of all time, surprisingly little is understood about the main type of body armour that both he and many of his men wore   the linothorax   as there are no surviving examples. The linothorax was a type of body armour created by laminating together layers of linen. It wrapped around the torso and tied over the shoulder with two flaps. The most famous image of this kind of body armour is the Alexander Mosaic: a celebrated ancient mosaic which was found in the largest house in Pompeii   the House of the Faun   and depicts Alexander the Great s defeat of the Persian king Darius. Alexander the Great at the battle of Issus. He can be seen on the left of the mosaic from the House of Faun, with his opponent, Pesian king Darius III, on the right (Photo by: Werner Forman/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) When his friend Hephaestion, Alexander held a hugely expensive funeral Hephaestion was a member of Alexander s personal bodyguard and a general in his army. He was also Alexander s best friend, right-hand man, and some say his lover as well. When he died suddenly in Ecbatana from unknown causes, Alexander wrote to the Oracle at Siwa in Egypt and asked if Hephaestion should be honoured as a god or a hero. The Oracle replied that he should be honoured as a hero, and so Alexander went all out for a mausoleum/funeral pyre designed to impress. The Library of History, compiled by Diodorus Siculus, includes several accounts of the funeral pyre, of which there were seven levels   each level more lavishly decorated than the last. Perched upon the bottom layer of 240 golden prows of ships and held up by palm tree trunks, Siculus says, there were:  Torches fifteen cubits high with golden wreaths about their handles. At their flaming ends perched eagles with outspread wings looking downward, while about their bases were serpents looking up at the eagles, [ ] a multitude of wild animals being pursued by hunters, [ ] a centauromachy rendered in gold, while the fifth [level] showed lions and bulls alternating, also in gold. The next higher level was covered with Macedonian and Persian arms, testifying to the prowess of the one people and to the defeats of the other. On top of all stood Sirens, hollowed out and able to conceal within them persons who sang a lament in mourning for the dead. The total height of the pyre was more than one hundred and thirty cubits.  A cubit is an ancient measurement of length based on the distance from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger, so it varies. But the pyre, as described here, could have been more than 50 metres high. Alexander the Great plundered the treasuries of all his cities to pay for the monument   it has been estimated to have cost the modern equivalent of two billion dollars. Alexander the Great had made his seat of government in Babylon, the capital of Babylonia (the alluvial plain between the Euphrates and Tigris), and he wanted to hold the funeral ceremony within the walls of the city. However, the monument was so huge that Alexander had to break down one of the city s walls to get it inside. He then set the monument on fire, cremating the general s body along with the magnificent pyre. What is Alexander the Great's legacy? Spencer Day examines how Alexander left his mark on the lands he conquered... According to Plutarch, Alexander the Great founded 70 towns and cities, including at least 16 that he modestly named Alexandria. For centuries, historians and military strategists alike have extolled Alexander s genius as a soldier, and rightly so. But, for all that, perhaps his greatest impact on human history derives not from his brilliance as a commander but as a supreme cultural ambassador. Alexander didn t simply wipe cities from the face of the Earth, before moving on to the next target   not all the time anyway. Instead, he left colonies of fellow Macedonians to administer conquered population centres, and they went about disseminating Greek methods of expression and thinking. As a result, peoples from modern-day Turkey through Asia Minor all the way to India played Greek sports, watched Greek theatre, mimicked Greek art and adopted Greek scientific practices. In many cases, they continued to do so for centuries. The cities of Ai Khanum in what is now Afghanistan and Philoteris in Egypt may have been separated by some 3,000 miles but they both boasted Greek gymnasiums. Ai Khanum was also home to an Acropolis, a theatre and library   a direct consequence of Alexander s extraordinary conquests. Alexander s incursion into India was brief and bloody, but its impact on the subcontinent s culture was significant. It inspired the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha in Indian sculpture and the appearance of Greek mythological figures, including Herakles, in Buddhist literature. It may even lie behind Indian astrologers  adoption of the signs of the zodiac. It seems that Alexander s cultural impact may even have spread beyond the borders of his massive empire, perhaps seeping into China. The theorem of Pythagoras reached the Chinese within decades of Alexander s death, and it s thought that the Terracotta Army may have been influenced by Greek models. But perhaps Alexander s most enduring cultural legacy was the fact that, for a thousand years, Greek became the  lingua franca  of the near east. As a result, when the Christian New Testament was first recorded, it was written down in Greek, the very language that Alexander had himself spoken hundreds of years earlier.

        "target_summary": "This extensive guide meticulously unpacks the extraordinary life, legendary conquests, complex personality, and enduring legacy of Alexander the Great, drawing upon insights from Spencer Day, Jeremy Pound, Professor Paul Cartledge, and Jennifer Macaire. It paints a vivid portrait of a figure who dramatically reshaped the ancient world, becoming both a revered hero and a controversial tyrant.\n\nBorn in 356 BC in Pella, Macedonia, to King Philip II and the politically ambitious Olympias, Alexander’s early life was steeped in privilege and intellectual rigor. From 343 BC, he embarked on an unparalleled education under the celebrated Greek philosopher Aristotle, fostering a deep fascination with mythical Greek heroes like Achilles – an aspiration that would profoundly shape his destiny. At the tender age of 20, in 336 BC, Alexander swiftly ascended to the Macedonian throne following the assassination of his father, Philip II. Some historians even suggest Alexander's connivance in the patricide, a testament to his ruthless ambition. He rapidly consolidated his power, brutally quelling internal unrest and making a chilling example of the city of Thebes, which he razed to the ground, slaughtering or enslaving its inhabitants. This early display of merciless resolve foreshadowed the formidable leader he would become.\n\nAlexander inherited not just a kingdom, but a formidable military machine forged by his father, Philip II, who had transformed Macedon from a peripheral state into the dominant power in Greece. Building on this foundation, Alexander articulated a grand vision: to lead a united Greek invasion of the Persian Empire, ostensibly to avenge centuries-old grievances, but driven equally by an insatiable personal ambition to reach the \"end of the Earth.\" In May 334 BC, he crossed the Hellespont into Asia Minor with an army of approximately 50,000, initiating an eleven-year campaign that would cover some 20,000 miles across three continents and an empire spanning two million square miles, from modern-day Turkey to the Indian Punjab.\n\nHis military genius was undeniably paramount. Alexander combined immense personal charisma with unparalleled bravery, consistently leading his troops from the front lines – a stark contrast to his Persian foe Darius III. His priceless ability to identify the decisive moment in battle and act with lightning-quick precision ensured a string of unbroken victories. He primarily employed the formidable Macedonian phalanx, a rectangular mass of closely ranked troops armed with five-meter-long sarissas, a tactic perfected by his father. Across battles such as Granicus, Issus, and the climactic Gaugamela, Alexander’s strategic brilliance consistently outmaneuvered vastly larger Persian forces. At Gaugamela in 331 BC, Alexander's army, less than half the size of Darius's estimated 200,000 infantry and 34,000 cavalry, achieved a crushing victory, resulting in approximately 50,000 Persian casualties against a mere 1,000 Greeks. Darius III fled, effectively ending the once-mighty Persian Empire and cementing Alexander’s status as the most powerful man in the world at just 25. Later, in India, at the incredibly hard-fought Battle of Hydaspes, his phalanx overcame an Indian army bolstered by 200 war elephants, marking one of his most impressive and bloodiest triumphs. He remained undefeated in battle, establishing his place among history's greatest military commanders alongside figures like Napoleon and Genghis Khan.\n\nBeyond the battlefield, Alexander meticulously cultivated an aura of divine destiny. He genuinely believed he was descended from gods, even journeying perilously across the Saharan desert to the oracle at Siwa Oasis, where he claimed its deity, Amon (identified with Zeus), confirmed his divine parentage. He expected, and often demanded, to be worshipped as a living god, a practice not unprecedented given his father Philip had also been deified. This inherent megalomania, while a powerful motivator for his extraordinary feats, was skillfully amplified by his propagandist, Callisthenes, who disseminated tales that enhanced Alexander’s semi-mythic status, such as the legendary untying of the Gordian Knot. His personal life was complex; while he married three times and sired at least two sons, and was bisexual, finding gratification with both men and women, he famously remarked that \"sex and sleep are the only two things that remind me I'm mortal.\" His closest and warmest relationship was with his boyhood companion and general, Hephaestion, whose death would later profoundly affect him. Away from the rigors of conquest, Alexander found relaxation in big game hunting, a dangerous pursuit that mirrored his ruthless drive towards all his goals.\n\nYet, Alexander’s reign was not without significant flaws. He was criticized for failing to invest enough energy in the peaceful administration of his diverse empire, an oversight compounded by his lack of a living male heir at the time of his death. His impetuous nature, combined with a tendency to believe alleged conspiracies, led to the execution of trusted subordinates and former friends. The strain of constant campaigning eventually took its toll on his loyal, though weary, army. In 326 BC, after the brutal engagement at Hydaspes and facing the prospect of crossing the formidable River Ganges and confronting fresh Indian kingdoms, his men mutinied, refusing to advance further. This pivotal moment forced Alexander to accept the end of his eastward expansion, marking the conclusion of his remarkable campaign of conquest.\n\nThe arduous return journey from India was fraught with hardship, depleting his forces through flash floods, drought, and disease. Alexander’s once-razor-sharp mind became increasingly erratic; he descended into bouts of heavy drinking, and plots against him began to simmer. The sudden death of Hephaestion in 324 BC, possibly from typhus exacerbated by alcohol, devastated Alexander, accelerating his decline. He reached Babylon in spring 323 BC, where he took to his sickbed and died within days, just before his 33rd birthday. The exact cause of his death remains one of history’s great mysteries, with theories ranging from malarial or typhoid fever to poisoning. His death left a profound power vacuum, plunging his vast empire into decades of conflict as his generals vied for control.\n\nDespite the controversies and the dramatic, premature end to his life, Alexander the Great left an unparalleled and enduring legacy. He founded some 70 towns and cities, including at least 16 named Alexandria, which became thriving hubs of Hellenistic culture. Far from merely destroying, he became a \"supreme cultural ambassador,\" disseminating Greek methods, sports, theatre, art, and scientific practices across the conquered lands. Peoples from modern-day Turkey to Afghanistan and India adopted Greek customs, building gymnasiums and acropolises that echoed those in Greece. His brief incursion into India profoundly influenced the subcontinent’s culture, inspiring the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha in sculpture and even the adoption of the signs of the zodiac. There is even speculation that his cultural impact reached China, influencing the Terracotta Army. Perhaps his most significant and enduring legacy, however, was establishing Greek as the \"lingua franca\" of the Near East for a thousand years, a linguistic foundation so pervasive that the Christian New Testament was ultimately recorded in the very language Alexander himself spoke centuries earlier.\n\nFrom his iconic image, likely preserved in the Azara herm (a Roman copy of Lysippus’s bust), to the legendary tales of him playing polo with Persian royalty or descending into the sea in a diving bell (whether fact or \"Alexander Romance\"), his life continues to fascinate. Even the reliability of ancient biographers like Plutarch, who wrote centuries later with potential biases, underscores the monumental task of piecing together the true story of this singular figure. Alexander the Great, both venerated and critiqued, remains one of antiquity's most formidable and culturally transformative leaders, whose impact resonates profoundly through millennia.",

        "content": "Ad Solon, c630 c560 BC One of the innovations the ancient Greeks are most famed for is democracy   a political system of ruling by the people as opposed to by a monarch or dictator   and its grandfather is considered to be the Athenian magistrate Solon. Born in the late seventh century BC, Solon was chosen to become a governor or archon of Athens. Through his economic reforms, he freed those who had been forced into debt-slavery for not being able to pay their creditors, and encouraged people to take up trades to avoid poverty. Thanks to Solon, all Athenian male citizens could also attend the general assembly for the first time, and rule was taken from being solely in the hands of the city-state's aristocratic families. Many of the lawmaker s reforms failed initially, as Athens was temporarily ruled by the tyrant Peisistratos a few years after Solon left the city. His efforts, however, would lay the foundations for the reforms brought in by Cleisthenes a few decades later, which formally established democracy in Athens. Hippocrates, c460 c375 BC Unusually for the ancient world, physician and philosopher Hippocrates believed that illnesses had rational rather than supernatural explanations. At the time, the gods and magical curses were often blamed for causing disease. Instead, Hippocrates  pupils were encouraged to observe their patients, note their symptoms, and analyse how their illnesses progressed. He established medicine as a formal profession, and the Hippocratic Oath   a code of conduct for doctors   still inspires the one taken by physicians around the world today. He was also a believer in exercising and eating a healthy diet as a way of preventing and treating disease. The work of Hippocrates later inspired the physician Galen (AD 129  c210), and the ideas of both men were treated as fact until the late medieval period.  about the history of medicine Sophocles, c496 406 BC As much as we love a laugh when we go to the theatre, there's something about a tragic story that appeals and pulls at the heartstrings, and we have the Athenians to thank for the genre of tragedy. Watching a play in ancient Greece was a favourite pastime, and festivals held to honour the god Dionysus saw three dramatic genres emerge: tragedy, comedy and satyr drama (the latter combining both). The works of Sophocles are some of the earliest-surviving tragic plays, and include Oedipus Rex and Antigone. Born just outside Athens in the early fifth century BC, Sophocles  talents first came to prominence when he won first prize for tragedy in the Dionysian festival, beating the Athenian king of drama, Aeschylus. As well as his work as a dramatist, Sophocles worked as a treasurer, diplomat and general, and is thought to have written more than 120 plays, though only seven complete works survive. He also did much to revolutionise drama, with perhaps his most important innovation being the addition of a third actor to a play. Previously two actors would play several roles, but with the addition of one more, more characters could be written, and the plot could become more varied and exciting. Sappho, c630 570 BC Thought to have been born in the late seventh century BC on the island of Lesbos, poet Sappho was from an aristocratic family. On Lesbos, she ran an academy for young unmarried women devoted to Eros and Aphrodite   the god and goddess of love. Sappho was considered one of the greatest lyric poets of her day and mainly wrote on the themes of love, family and friendship. While some say she died of old age, other stories claim that she threw herself off a cliff after having her heart broken. Three centuries after her death, Sappho became the source of parody and was characterised as a promiscuous homosexual   the term  lesbian  is derived from the island where she was born and  sapphic  refers to love between women, as well as the four-line form that Sappho s poetry usually took. There is little concrete evidence about her true sexuality, though, and she wrote as passionately about men as she did women.

Before pursuing philosophy, Socrates fought in the Peloponnesian War and worked as a stonemason. His philosophical ideas were extremely radical for the time   he believed that people should focus on their behaviour and morality rather than wealth and power. Although he attracted many scholars to his discussions, Socrates wasn t widely liked in Athens and was an outspoken opponent of democracy. In 399 BC, he was sentenced to death after being charged with corrupting the city s youth and disrespecting the gods. \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] Socrates wasn't widely liked in ancient Athens.

We have little concrete knowledge about his life, though it s thought he was born in Samos in the early-sixth century BC. After travelling, Pythagoras settled in Italy where he formed a secret group of students who lived by a philosophy based around mathematics   appropriately known as the Pythagoreans. He is credited with discovering the functional significance of numbers, as well as the Pythagoras theorem, used to calculate the length of the sides in a right-angled triangle. Pericles, c495 429 BC General and statesmen Pericles oversaw Athens during its golden age and was so well respected that he was lauded as the city s  first citizen . He led Athens during the first few years of the Peloponnesian War and expanded the Delian League   a group of Greek states   into an empire. A lover of the arts and literature, his ambitious building programme, which included the Acropolis, helped Athens become the cultural and educational centre of the ancient world. He succumbed to the Plague of Athens in 429 BC. Herodotus, c484 c425 BC Without Herodotus, we might not know as much as we do about the events of ancient Greece. He's believed to have hailed from Halicarnassus, a Greek city that was under Persian rule at his birth in the early fifth century. In around 425 BC, he published The Histories   an account of the Greco-Persian Wars. This was the first time that a writer had attempted to explain the cause of an event, or study it in such detail   and so historical analysis was born. Herodotus' work was based on his travels across the Persian and Greek territories and the stories he collected on the way. What we know about the battle of Marathon is all thanks to Herodotus. Other writers criticised his weaving of fiction into his narratives, but he is widely considered the first true historian. Alexander the Great, 356 323 BC Despite his short rule, Alexander the Great transformed the ancient world in just over a decade. In 336 BC, after the assassination of his father, Alexander ascended the Macedonian throne at the age of 20; educated by the great philosopher Aristotle, he was an adept leader and strategist. Under his rule, Macedonia continued asserting its power within Greece. Even more impressively, Alexander conquered territories that were formerly part of the Persian empire without losing a single major battle, including Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt. At 25, he was leader of Greece, pharaoh of Egypt and overlord of Asia Minor, and for the next decade he consolidated his sprawling empire, which spanned three continents. His death at the age of 32 saw his empire broken up, and many historians have since questioned how much more he could have achieved had he lived longer. Today he is still considered one of history s greatest military commanders. Archimedes, c287 212 BC If you ve ever had a brilliant idea and shouted  Eureka! , you have Greek scientist and inventor Archimedes to thank for that. According to an anecdotal story, Archimedes allegedly discovered that the amount of water displaced when he entered his bathtub was equal to the amount of upward force put on the body. He was so delighted that he apparently ran down the street naked, shouting  Eureka!    Greek for  I have found it! . Whether or not the story is true, Archimedes, who hailed from Syracuse in Sicily, is one of ancient Greece s most famous scientists, inventors and mathematicians. He discovered the law of hydrostatics, the principles of the lever and created siege engines. It s thought that Archimedes' inventions even included machines that could lift ships out of the water, and found an accurate approximation of pi   the ratio of the circumference of any circle to the diameter of that circle. Despite this, Archimedes  mathematical writings were little known in his own time   it wasn t until the sixth century AD that they gained a wide readership.  | The siege of Syracuse: how Archimedes took on the Romans Homer, c8th century BC If you were to take an epic journey or voyage   physical or spiritual   some may describe it as an odyssey. The use of this term goes all the way back to a poem written during the early days of the ancient Greeks. Few concrete facts are known about the life of Homer, but legends claim he was a blind bard from the island of Chios and that his poems would have been spread orally before being written down. His work is presumed to include the Iliad   one of the most important sources about the legendary Trojan War   and the Odyssey   an account of the epic journey taken by Odysseus after the fall of Troy. The works were the foundation of ancient Greek literature and are still considered some of the most important in the western canon. There is some debate over exactly who wrote the poems attributed to Homer, but experts agree they were written around the late eighth to early seventh century BC. Whether Homer did write them or not, the epics shaped Greek culture, highlighted popular values of the time (such as honour and courage), and remain some of the oldest surviving works of literature still widely read today. Homer s epic Iliad depicts the bitter 10-year siege of Troy by a coalition of Greeks. (Photo by Ann Ronan Pictures/Print Collector/Getty Images) Aristotle, 384 322 BC Philosopher and polymath Aristotle came from a tradition of great thinkers   he was a pupil of Plato who was himself a student of Socrates. Aristotle founded a school of philosophy at the Lyceum in Athens and was considered influential enough to be the teacher of the young Alexander the Great. Aristotle s writings were some of the first to create a system of western philosophy that included logic, science, morality, politics and metaphysics. He heavily influenced Christian theology, as well as medieval Islamic and Jewish traditions, and his work is still studied and analysed today. Pheidias, c480 430 BC Pheidias was one of the most famous artists of the ancient world whose greatest works have unfortunately not stood the test of time. Little of his life is known, but he worked mainly in Athens before creating a workshop at Olympia. Here, he created his greatest masterpiece   a gold and ivory seated statue of Zeus that became one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. He also created three monuments to Athena, as well the Parthenon carvings   these survive today, and those in the British Museum are known as the Elgin Marbles. Pheidias  later years took a dramatic turn when he was thrown in prison after being accused of embezzling gold intended for a statue of Athena; it s thought he died while incarcerated. Anyte of Tegea, c3rd century BC Anyte was so celebrated as a poet in the third century BC that she was widely known as the female Homer. Born in Arcadia in the Peloponnese, she stood out from the crowd as one of the first poets to focus on the natural world rather than the gods or the supernatural. Ancient Greek poets were often commissioned to write epitaphs and epigrams to celebrate battle victories and heroes, but Anyte instead memorialised loved ones and favourite pets. More of her work survives than any other ancient Greek female writer, except for Sappho.

This fundamentally shifted governance from aristocratic control, laying crucial groundwork for future democratic reforms.\n\n**Hippocrates** (c460-c375 BC), a pioneering physician, revolutionized ancient medicine by advocating rational explanations for illness over supernatural beliefs. He established medicine as a formal, observational profession, inspiring the enduring Hippocratic Oath and championing preventative health through diet and exercise.\n\n**Sophocles** (c496-406 BC), an Athenian master of tragic drama, penned timeless plays like *Oedipus Rex* and *Antigone*. A prolific writer with over 120 works attributed to him, he dramatically advanced theatrical art by introducing a third actor, which allowed for richer narratives and character complexity.\n\n**Sappho** (c630-570 BC), an aristocratic lyric poet from Lesbos, was celebrated for her eloquent verses on love, family, and friendship, often shared within her academy for young women. Her powerful expression influenced terminology like \"lesbian\" and \"sapphic,\" reflecting her profound exploration of intimate emotions.\n\n**Socrates** (c470-399 BC), the foundational figure of Western philosophy, championed a radical focus on morality and virtuous behavior over material wealth, his profound insights meticulously preserved by his student, Plato. Despite his influence, his outspoken critiques led to his condemnation and execution for corrupting Athens' youth.\n\n**Pythagoras** (c570-c495 BC), the enigmatic mathematician, founded a secret society dedicated to a philosophy rooted in numbers. He is widely credited with discovering the fundamental significance of numerical relationships and the eponymous Pythagorean theorem, a cornerstone of geometry.\n\n**Pericles** (c495-429 BC), Athens' esteemed \"first citizen\" and statesman, ushered in the city's golden age. A grand patron of the arts, his ambitious architectural projects, including the Acropolis, solidified Athens as a leading cultural and intellectual hub, even as he led during the early years of the Peloponnesian War.\n\n**Herodotus** (c484-c425 BC), hailed as the \"first true historian,\" painstakingly documented the Greco-Persian Wars in *The Histories*. His groundbreaking approach—analyzing causes and events through extensive travel and collected narratives—birthed the discipline of historical inquiry itself.\n\n**Alexander the Great** (356-323 BC), the audacious Macedonian king tutored by Aristotle, forged an unparalleled empire across three continents in just over a decade. His strategic genius led him to conquer vast Persian territories without a single major defeat, solidifying his legacy as one of history's supreme military commanders before his premature death at 32.\n\n**Archimedes** (c287-212 BC), the brilliant scientist and inventor from Syracuse, made indelible marks on mathematics and physics.

His *Iliad* and *Odyssey*, detailing the Trojan War and Odysseus's arduous journey, established enduring values and remain cornerstones of the literary world.\n\n**Aristotle** (384-322 BC), the brilliant polymath and student of Plato, developed a comprehensive system of Western philosophy encompassing logic, science, politics, and metaphysics. His profound teachings, imparted even to Alexander the Great, laid intellectual cornerstones that deeply influenced medieval thought across diverse traditions.\n\n**Pheidias** (c480-430 BC), one of antiquity's most celebrated artists, created the lost masterpiece, the gold and ivory Statue of Zeus, a Wonder of the Ancient World.

His pivotal reforms in the 6th century BC liberated debt-slaves, encouraged trades, and, for the first time, allowed all Athenian male citizens to participate in the general assembly, laying crucial groundwork for future democratic governance. Later, the statesman **Pericles** would guide Athens through its \"golden age,\" expanding its influence and transforming the city into a vibrant cultural and educational center through ambitious architectural projects like the Acropolis.\n\nIn the realm of medicine, **Hippocrates** revolutionized understanding by positing rational, rather than supernatural, causes for illness. This visionary physician established medicine as a formal profession, emphasizing meticulous observation and ethical practice, elements of which still resonate in the Hippocratic Oath today. Scientific inquiry flourished further with the enigmatic mathematician **Pythagoras**, credited with fundamental discoveries about numbers and his famous theorem, and the brilliant Syracusan inventor **Archimedes**, whose ingenuity birthed principles of hydrostatics and mechanics, encapsulated in his legendary cry of \"Eureka!\"\n\nPhilosophy found its bedrock in **Socrates**, the foundational figure of Western thought. His ideas, preserved by his pupil Plato, championed morality and self-reflection, leading to his execution for challenging Athenian norms. Building upon this legacy, the polymath **Aristotle**, Plato's student and tutor to Alexander the Great, systematically cataloged vast fields of knowledge, from logic and ethics to politics, profoundly influencing subsequent intellectual traditions across centuries.\n\nLiterary and artistic expression thrived, commencing with the legendary bard **Homer**, whose epic poems, \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey,\" became foundational texts of Western literature, shaping Greek culture with their tales of honor and courage. **Sophocles**, a master tragedian, captivated audiences with plays like *Oedipus Rex*, revolutionizing dramatic storytelling by introducing a third actor for richer narratives. The lyric poet **Sappho** from Lesbos crafted exquisite verses on love and friendship, celebrated for her profound emotional depth, while **Anyte of Tegea**, hailed as the \"female Homer,\" offered a unique poetic voice, celebrating the natural world and personal relationships in her distinctive epitaphs.\n\nThe very concept of historical analysis was pioneered by **Herodotus**, often called the \"Father of History.\" His comprehensive *The Histories* meticulously documented the Greco-Persian Wars, seeking to explain their causes through extensive travel and diligent research. Military prowess reached an unparalleled zenith with **Alexander the Great**, an astonishingly brilliant strategist who, educated by Aristotle, conquered an immense empire spanning three continents in just over a decade without losing a major battle, dramatically reshaping the ancient world before his untimely death. Finally, the artistic genius of **Pheidias** left an indelible mark, sculpting masterpieces such as the colossal gold and ivory Statue of Zeus, one of the Seven Wonders, and the enduring carvings of the Parthenon, famously known as the Elgin Marbles.",

        "title": "Why did Hitler choose the swastika as a Nazi symbol?",
        "content": "The swastika is today synonymous with Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime; a red and black symbol of the Second World War. But this hasn't always been the case   the swastika existed as a symbol long before it was adopted by the Nazis, and the symbol's story is longer and more complex than you might expect. Ad So how and why did the Nazis use the swastika, and what is the ancient origin of the symbol made infamous by Hitler? Why did Hitler choose the swastika? When Adolf Hitler began his rise to power and looked for a symbol to encapsulate his movement, the Nazi Party and a strong future for Germany, the swastika became the clear choice. German antiquarian Heinrich Schliemann had grown obsessed with finding Troy, the lost city of Greek mythology, and in 1868 he set out with his copy of The Iliad to search the Mediterranean. Schliemann's search led him to the mysterious mound of Hisarlik on the Aegean coast of Turkey. There, during the 1870s, Schliemann unearthed layers of civilisations dating back thousands of years, and declared the oldest to be Troy. The city of legend had been found   although it turned out to be a different layer than the one Schliemann thought   as well as a cache of jewellery, bronze, silver and gold. Yet in the ancient ruins he made another fateful discovery: some 1,800 depictions of a symbol that resembled a cross with bent arms: the swastika. News of Schliemann s sensational excavations spread far and wide, quickly followed by the swastika, which became a ubiquitous sign, visible throughout Europe and North America. At the same time, however, the swastika s long history saw it become a favourite of German nationalists, who subscribed to a warped theory that they had descended from an ancient  master race  known as the Aryans. This belief persisted into the 20th century, growing more pernicious until it appealed to Adolf Hitler, the leader of the burgeoning Nazi Party. Hitler understood the power of an image and knew it would give the Nazi ideals an historic foundation. He could not adequately reconcile his view of Germany s Christian history with the religion s historical Jewish connections   essentially, that Christ was himself Jewish   so the idea that Germans descended from a white master race with a tried and tested symbol had great appeal. And so the swastika, or hakenkreuz (hooked cross), became the emblem of the Nazi Party in 1920; Hitler himself took personal credit for designing the flag. It used the red, white and black of the old German imperial flag   a cunning move to link Germany's past with its future   but attributed new meanings to them. \"In red we see the social idea of the movement, in white the nationalistic idea, in the swastika the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man,\" wrote Hitler in his 1925 autobiographical manifesto, Mein Kampf. The new design became the national flag on 15 September 1935 during the mass annual rally at Nuremberg. On the same day, two race laws were passed prohibiting marriages between Germans and Jews and declaring that only those of German blood could be citizens of the Reich. And so the act of cultural, religious and social theft that was the appropriation of the swastika was complete. It ensured that the Nazi flag would be associated with evil   under which a brutal war raged, atrocities committed and some six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. What is the swastika? A cross with arms bent at right angles meant many things to many people, but had always been used as a sign of hope and positivity. It could represent good fortune or prosperity; symbolise the Sun or the infinity of creation; or, as it still does in several religions, evoke a sense of the divine and call for auspiciousness. The word swastika itself derives from the Sanskrit svastika, meaning \"conducive to well-being\". What is the history of the swastika? The oldest-known example of the swastika dates back some 15,000 years. Discovered in Ukraine in 1908, an ivory mammoth tusk carved into the shape of a bird includes an intricate pattern of connected swastikas on its body, which may have been used as a fertility symbol. There is no knowing how the design first came about. It may have simply been an elegant, easy-to-create geometric shape, although its inspiration possibly came from a comet in the night sky. It was also in Eastern Europe that single swastikas were carved by the Vinca culture during the Neolithic period, some 7,000 years ago, before they became widespread from the Bronze Age. The swastika symbolised the Sun to the Illyrians; became a common sight on Mesopotamian coins; appeared on vases and clothing in Greece; formed mosaic motifs in Rome, and stands in as a stylised cross in Celtic design. There are 27 swastikas on the Iron Age Battersea Shield, found in London in 1857, but the symbol had been in Britain long before that as the so-called Swastika Stone on Ilkley Moor, Yorkshire, from c2,000 BC, shows. This carving resembles the swastika s shape, although with more curved arms and added spots. Swastikas could be found in Roman mosaics, as evidenced in this one excavated at Lullingtone Roman Villa in Eynsford, Kent (Photo by English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images) The swastika, often known as a gammadion or fylflot, continued to be used throughout Europe, occasionally being subsumed into religious iconography. Early Christian art depicts the hooked cross to represent Christ's victory over death, while a left-facing version of the swastika showed up in reference to the Norse god Thor's hammer. Still a popular symbol in medieval times, the swastika can be seen today on surviving church decorations, coats of arms and on textile fragments from the 12th century thought to be from a dress owned by a Slav princess. The monastery school a young Adolf Hitler attended, Lambach Abbey in Austria, had swastikas carved on the stone and woodwork. Yet the influence of the swastika reached much further than can be explained by the migration of peoples over the centuries. It has appeared in several cultures across northern Africa, including as window decorations in churches in modern-day Ethiopia, while also showing up in the Mayan, Aztec and Kuna civilisations of South and Central America. A number of Native American and First Nation tribes of North America, such as the Navajo, Hopi and Passamaquoddy, also adopted the symbol, which they called  whirling logs . Swastikas are prevalent and potent symbols in several religions: there s a small one on the chest of this Buddha in Hong Kong s Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery (Photo by Victor Fraile/Corbis via Getty Images) Undoubtedly the most enduring relationship with the swastika began in Asia, especially in India, among followers of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, for whom it has served as a holy symbol for millennia. To Jains, the swastika represents one of the 24 Tirthankara, or saviours, while Buddhists regard the symbol as the footprints of the Buddha. For Hindus, the right-hand svastika   a term that emerged c500 BC   is a sign of surya (the Sun) and auspiciousness, so is used to mark entrances, offerings, ceremonies, festivals and each year's account books. The left-hand version, the sauvastika, is symbolic of the night and the goddess Kali. The swastika remains as spiritually significant today, in the face of the stigma towards the symbol in the West brought on by the Nazis. How did the swastika become a Nazi symbol? Heinrich Schliemann's discovery of Troy in the 1870s set in motion the events that transformed the swastika, a symbol of fortune and hope for thousands of years, into a hated and feared sign of fascism. He concluded it to be a \"significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors\" when he unearthed 1,800 examples, but his colleague, Emile-Louis Burnouf, thought differently. Knowing the symbol appeared in India, Burnouf studied a sacred Hindu text called the Rigveda and claimed to have found a connection between the swastika and an enigmatic ancient people, the Aryans. Burnouf studied a sacred Hindu text called the Rigveda and claimed to have found a connection between the swastika and an enigmatic ancient people, the Aryans Supposedly, this 'master race' of white-skinned warriors constituted the peak of human civilisation, conquering lands such as India and bringing the swastika with them. The word Aryan itself derived from Sanskrit, like svastika. Pots from the sixth-century had been found in Germany with swastikas on them and scholars noted the similarities between Sanskrit and German as further proof that the Aryans had come from Germany. But the whole notion of this 'pure' race, as well as being deeply racist, was based on a misunderstanding. The Sanskrit word for Aryan ( rya) actually meant \"honourable, respectable or noble\" and referred to a social or linguistic distinction, not a separate ethnic group. Before the Nazis, the swastika was widely adopted in the West as a symbol of luck and fortune (Photo by Rykoff Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) But the theory of the Aryans  existence grew in popularity from the mid-19th century. The unification of Germany in 1871, the same year Schliemann started work at Troy, led to a swell of uninhibited nationalism in the country and the idea that Germans descended from Aryans. To them, the discovery at Troy of their symbol, the swastika, proved they had been a dominant race. So while the swastika existed as a benign good-luck charm across Europe and North America, it simultaneously became an icon for German nationalists and anti-Semitic groups. What is the swastika a symbol of today? In the aftermath of World War II, publicly displaying the swastika was banned in Germany, where it remains illegal. Yet while reviled in the Western world, it continues to be a potent symbol with far-right and white-supremacist groups. In the US, where its use is permitted, incidents involving swastika flags and graffiti have increased in recent years, most infamously when neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. It can be seen seemingly everywhere in parts of the Indian subcontinent   from temple entrances to the front of taxis   and plays an important role in ceremonies and festivals But the swastika also remains a feature of worship for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. It can be seen seemingly everywhere in parts of the Indian subcontinent   from temple entrances to the front of taxis   and plays an important role in ceremonies and festivals. During Diwali   the Hindu festival of lights   the swastika is drawn with coloured sand, or rangoli, and depicted with lanterns to celebrate the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. In 2007, when German politicians attempted to introduce a swastika ban across the European Union, Hindus vehemently opposed the measure on religious grounds. Swastikas are drawn in coloured sand during Diwali celebrations (Photo by Shashi Sharma/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) Such disparate attitudes towards the swastika raises the question of whether the symbol   which for so long has been a force for good   can be reclaimed from its association with Hitler and the neo-Nazis who still display it. Would reclaiming the symbol mark the final defeat of the Third Reich and the hatred it advocated? Or is that impossible? The 20th-century corruption of the swastika came to represent so much of the horrors of Nazism that it should never be forgotten. Ad The answer, although not a neat one, may be that there will always be two utterly conflicting interpretations of the swastika, both of which are part of our history, present and future: one representing the worst of humanity and the other symbolising the best.",
        "target_summary": "The swastika, a symbol now inextricably linked to the horrors of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime and the devastation of the Second World War, possesses a far older and more intricate history than its infamous 20th-century appropriation suggests. For millennia, this distinctive cross with bent arms was a universally positive emblem, embodying hope, good fortune, and the divine across diverse cultures and continents. Deriving its name from the Sanskrit \"svastika,\" meaning \"conducive to well-being,\" its ancient journey began long before it became a potent symbol of hatred.\n\nIts earliest known manifestation dates back an astonishing 15,000 years, found carved into a mammoth tusk in Ukraine, potentially as a fertility charm. From simple geometric designs in Neolithic Eastern Europe, the swastika proliferated, appearing across the Bronze Age world as a sign of the Sun for the Illyrians, adorning Mesopotamian coins, Greek pottery, Roman mosaics, and Celtic art. Its presence was felt from ancient Britain's Iron Age shields to medieval European churches, representing Christ's triumph or Thor's hammer. Beyond Europe, its reach extended to churches in Northern Africa, the vibrant civilisations of the Mayan, Aztec, and Kuna in the Americas, and deeply into the traditions of Native American tribes who referred to it as \"whirling logs.\" Yet, its most profound and enduring spiritual significance bloomed in Asia, especially India, where it remains a hallowed symbol for Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains, embodying auspiciousness, the Buddha's footprints, or saviors.\n\nThe pivotal moment in the swastika's tragic transformation arrived in the 1870s with German antiquarian Heinrich Schliemann's sensational excavation of ancient Troy. There, among layers of millennia-old civilizations, Schliemann unearthed some 1,800 depictions of the symbol. This discovery ignited widespread fascination, but it was Schliemann's colleague, Emile-Louis Burnouf, who tragically set in motion the symbol's corruption. Burnouf, misinterpreting ancient Hindu texts, erroneously linked the swastika to an imagined \"Aryan master race\"—supposedly white-skinned warriors who brought civilization to India. This deeply racist and fallacious theory gained insidious traction, particularly among German nationalists post-unification in 1871, who eagerly embraced the idea that they were direct descendants of these \"Aryans\" and that the swastika was their ancestral emblem.\n\nAdolf Hitler, recognizing the immense power of an iconic image to lend a \"historic foundation\" to his burgeoning Nazi Party, seized upon this distorted narrative. Unable to reconcile his vision for Germany with Christianity's Jewish roots, the swastika offered a powerful, \"Aryan\" alternative. In 1920, Hitler personally designed the Nazi flag, incorporating the hooked cross (Hakenkreuz) with the imperial German colors of red, white, and black. He ascribed chilling new meanings: red for social ideas, white for nationalism, and the swastika for the \"struggle for the victory of the Aryan man.\" This flag, declared the national emblem in 1935 alongside discriminatory race laws, solidified the swastika's role in a brutal campaign of war, atrocities, and the systematic murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust. This act of \"cultural, religious and social theft\" irrevocably stained the symbol in the Western consciousness.\n\nToday, the swastika exists in stark, irreconcilable duality. In the Western world, particularly in Germany where its public display remains illegal, it is universally reviled as a potent emblem of hate, fascism, and white supremacy, tragically resurfacing in modern far-right movements. Yet, in the Indian subcontinent and among Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain communities worldwide, it steadfastly retains its sacred status, adorning temples, homes, and festival celebrations like Diwali, where it signifies light over darkness and good over evil. This profound divergence prompts a poignant question: can a symbol so deeply corrupted ever truly be \"reclaimed\" from its association with humanity's darkest chapter? The answer is complex, suggesting that the swastika will forever bear two utterly conflicting interpretations – one embodying the worst of human evil, the other symbolizing enduring hope and auspiciousness.",

        "content": "It should come as little surprise that in cultures throughout history and around the world, the Sun has been elevated to a divine status time and time again. Ever-watchful over us from the heavens, it is what gives us light and life. Ad So important is the star at the heart of our Solar System, Sun gods and goddesses often head up a pantheon or are represented as nothing more than a golden circle   the Sun itself. Another common trait across numerous mythologies is the deity riding a chariot across the sky, ensuring that each day will come. Some even battle in the underworld come night, so they might shine again. With ancient societies so reliant on agriculture, people worshipped these deities to bring good crop yields or for the energy and strength for survival. Symbolically, the Sun could also represent justice or wisdom. Each culture found their own way to worship the life-giving Sun. Here, we explore the origins and roles of the powerful sun deities that have gone down in history (then back up, every morning). Sun gods and goddesses: which are the most famous in world history?

(Photo by Getty Images) Name: Helios Origin: Greek Known as: God of the Sun, often regarded as a Titan Family: Son of Hyperion and Theia, brother of Selene (goddess of the Moon) and Eos (goddess of the dawn) Revered as the embodiment of the Sun, the Greek god Helios was believed to drive a horse-drawn chariot from east to west across the sky each day, marking the passage of day into night. Depictions often show him as a handsome man adorned in purple robes with a crown of Sun rays encircling his head. Although Helios was venerated across the Hellenistic world, his most significant cult centres were in Corinth and on the island of Rhodes, where he was patron. In fact, the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, depicts him. Erected around 280 BC, it stood for less than 60 years before collapsing in an earthquake. Apollo Apollo driving a chariot. (Photo by Heritage Art/Heritage Images via Getty Images) Name: Apollo Origin: Greek Known as: God of light, music, dance, poetry, archery, truth, prophecy and healing Family: Son of the chief Greek deity Zeus and Leto (goddess of motherhood); twin brother of Artemis (goddess of the hunt and the Moon) While Helios was associated with the physical Sun, Apollo represented the more abstract ideas of light and enlightenment. As the son of Zeus and Leto   born on the island of Delos alongside his twin sister, Artemis  Apollo held a prominent position among the Olympian deities. He was one of the most multi-faceted deities in the mythology, covering domains including music and dance, truth and prophecy, medicine and healing. His association with the arts meant the handsome and young Apollo was often depicted carrying a lyre, which he played to enchant both gods and mortals. He was also patron of the Muses, the goddesses of literature, science and the arts. Yet Apollo could equally be seen as an archer, able to bring disease and destruction with his arrows and known for his sometimes merciless retribution. Perhaps his most famous myth is his pursuit of Daphne, a nymph who did not reciprocate his love and transformed into a laurel tree to escape his advances. In her honour, Apollo adopted the laurel as his sacred plant.

(Photo by Getty Images) Name: Sol Origin: Roman Known as: God of the sun Family: None spoken of in the mythology Helios s counterpart among the Roman gods was Sol, who would be similarly depicted driving a four-horse chariot across the sky and wearing a solar crown. Among the temples dedicated to Sol in Rome, there was a shrine at the Circus Maximus, the chief arena for chariot racing, and Sol had another on the Quirinal (one of the seven hills of Rome). There, every 9 August, an annual sacrifice was left for Sol, which evolved into an act to commemorate Julius Caesar s victory at the battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC. Romans would gather to pay homage and seek his favour for bountiful harvests and protection from the darkness. Sol Invictus A relief of Sol Invictus along with Jupiter Dolichenus carved into marble. (Photo by: PHAS/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Name: Sol Invictus Origin: Roman Known as: God of the  unconquered Sun  Family: Associated with the earlier Sun god, Sol His name meaning  unconquered Sun , Sol Invictus was a later adaptation of Sol, while also amalgamating influences from Eastern religions. He was a powerful figure, often wearing military attire. In the third century AD, the roman emperor Aurelian revived the cult of Sol Invictus by establishing him as the primary deity in the Roman empire. Sol Invictus was celebrated with the festival Dies Natalis Solis Invicti on 25 December, the date that Romans celebrated the winter solstice. It is debated whether this celebration predated Christmas, or if it was chosen to be on the same day as the Christian festival. Regardless, Sol Invictus held his lofty position in the Roman pantheon until the spread of Christianity.

(Photo by Pierce Archive LLC/Buyenlarge via Getty Images) Name: Surya Origin: Hindu Known as: God of the sun Family: Son of Kashyapa (one of the Saptarishis, the seven ancient sages of the Rigveda) and Aditi (mother of the Adityas, a group of celestial deities) Surya is a prominent god of Hinduism going back to the Vedic texts of c1500 BC, once one of the five major deities alongside Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti and Ganesha. He was worshipped as a representation of all life. Like other Sun gods, Surya was shown riding a chariot, but his would be drawn by either seven horses or a single, seven-headed horse. The number represented the seven days of the week. His head would be encircled by sunlight, he carried lotus flowers in his hands, and he wore a close-fitting coat and high boots (or Scythian dress, which may suggest that he was influenced by religious iconography or Iran). According to the Puranas (ancient Hindu texts), the weapons of the gods were forged from pieces trimmed from Surya, highlighting his importance in divine protection. With temples dedicated to him across India, such as Konark Sun Temple in Odisha, worshippers perform Surya Namaskar (sun salutation) during their morning rituals, which pay homage and seek his blessings. Honourable mentions: Aryaman | God of the mid-morning Sun, one of the early Vedic Hindu deities Egyptian Sun gods Ra Ancient Egyptian emblem of god Ra, illustration from the book //Pantheon Egyptien//. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Name: Ra Origin: Egyptian Known as: God of the Sun and father of all the Egyptian gods Family: Father of the primordial gods Shu and Tefnut Ra (sometimes known as Re) was considered both the god of the Sun and the Sun itself. Rather than a chariot, he travelled across the sky in boats to bring light and warmth to the world. At night, Ra descended into the underworld to battle the serpent Apophis, who sought to prevent the Sun from rising and therefore destroy all life on Earth. With the head of a falcon and crowned with a solar disk, Ra was the creator god responsible for bringing the gods and mortals into existence. His importance is reflected in his merging with other deities, such as Amun to create the all-powerful god Amun-Ra. Worshipped throughout Egypt, the city of Heliopolis was one of the primary centres of the cult of this ancient Egyptian god. A relief depicting Akhenaten as a sphinx offering to the sun god Aten. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) Name: Aten Origin: Egyptian Known as: The solar disk Family: Aten has no creation myth or family mentioned in mythology During the reign of the pharaoh Akhenaten (c1353-1336 BC), the Egyptian pantheon was thrown out, including the chief deity Amun, and a little-known cult was established to be the only god. That was Aten, the solar disc. Akhenaten (originally called Amenhotep IV) built a new capital called Akhetaten (now Amarna) to be the religious centre of Atenism, and introduced a radical new artform. The Aten would be represented simply as a solar disk with rays extending down   usually towards the pharaoh and his family   ending in hands, symbolising the life-giving energy of the Aten. After Akhenaten died, his religious revolution was deemed heresy: the old gods were restored and the Aten removed. Honourable mentions: Khepri | God of the morning sun, represented with the head of a scarab beetle or simply in the form of the scarab beetle itself African Sun gods Lisa Name: Lisa Origin: West African Known as: God of the Sun to the Fon people Family: Twin brother of Mawu (goddess of the moon) Lisa was worshipped by the Fon people   who lived in Dahomey (now Benin) and parts of what are now Togo, in West Africa   as the embodiment of heat, work and strength. He and his sister Mawu, the goddess of the Moon, were central to the Vodun (Voodoo) tradition, together balancing the day and night. The mythology sometimes describes Lisa and Mawu as lovers who created the universe together; elsewhere, they are represented as a single being encompassing both male and female. Lisa was believed to govern the skill of craftmanship, bringing his son Gu to Earth to teach mortals essential skills, such as ironworking, home building and agriculture. In rituals and festivals, he was invoked to bless the fields with sunlight and provide the strength needed for the day s labour. Honourable mentions: Anyanwu | Goddess of the Sun in Igbo mythology, also of good fortune, knowledge, and wisdom Nzambi | God of the Sun, and supreme deity in traditional Kongo mythology Aztec Sun gods Huitzilopochtli Engraving depicting the Aztec Sun god Huitzilopochtli. (Photo by: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Name: Huitzilopochtli Origin: Aztec Known as: God of the Sun and war Family: Thought to be the son of Coatlicue (Earth goddess) Also a god of war, Huitzilopochtli was considered one of the most important amongst the Aztec pantheon. So revered, he was the patron of the capital city of Tenochtitlan and the Aztecs even referred to themselves as  the people of the Sun . According to two different stories in the mythology, Huitzilopochtli was either the son of Ometeotl (the name of a pair of creator deities) or was immaculately conceived by Coatlicue, the Earth goddess. In one version, he was born fully grown and armoured and immediately fought his brothers and sisters. Huitzilopochtli wielded Xiuhcoatl, the fire serpent, as a weapon. His name originates from Nahuatl, the main language of the Aztecs, and translates to 'hummingbird of the left  (Aztecs believed the best warriors were reincarnations of hummingbirds). Huitzilopochtli was often depicted as the bird or a warrior in its feathers. Tonatiuh Head of Tonatiuh. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) Name: Tonatiuh Origin: Aztec Known as: God of the  Fifth Sun  Family: Born through the self-sacrifice of a god, who threw himself in a fire According to the mythology of the Nahua, Mesoamerican peoples of central Mexico of which the Aztec belonged, it was believed that there had been four cycles of the world. Each of these  Suns  had its own creation and destruction. Tonatiuh was the  Fifth Sun , the solar deity of the final cycle. He was created and rose into the sky through the self-sacrifice of a weaker god. Associated with the eagle, he would be born each day at dawn and had to be encouraged by the gods on his travels across the sky, before dying at each sunset. The Aztecs kept him on his journey by daily offerings of blood, so his worship was linked with human sacrifice. Honourable mentions: Nanahuatzin | The god, whose name means  full of sores , that threw himself into fire to be transformed into Tonatiuh Incan Sun gods Inti A design representing the sun deity, Inti. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) Name: Inti Origin: Incan Known as: God of the Sun and patron deity of the Incan empire Family: Brother of Mama Quilla (goddess of the Moon) The Inca believed that the Sun god Inti was the direct ancestor of their emperor, the Sapa Inca, and his family. Unsurprisingly, Inti s cult was imposed across the empire to reinforce the Sapa Inca s right to rule. Depicted as a golden disk with rays shining out from his human face, Inti was central to Incan religious practices: the temple dedicated to him, Coricancha in the capital of Cusco, was the most important in the empire; and his festival, Inti Raymi, celebrated at the winter solstice (which in the southern hemisphere is in June), was one of the most significant events in the Incan calendar. It marked the return of the sun and the renewal of life. The Inca called upon him to control the agricultural cycle, ensuring the growth of crops and the prosperity of the empire. Honourable mentions: Illapa | While not a Sun god, the thunder god was the lord of the weather overall Mayan Sun Gods Kinich Ahau Wall decoration depicting the Sun god Kinich Ahau. (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images) Name: Kinich Ahau Origin: Mayan Known as: God of the Sun, who controlled disease and drought Family: Brother of Chaac (god of rain, thunder and lightning) in some mythologies In Mayan art, Kinich Ahau is seen as an old man with large, square eyes, a hooked nose and a sharpened tooth. He could also be presented as animals associated with power, such as a jaguar or eagle.

According to legend, she retreated into a cave following a dispute with her brother Susanoo, and plunged the world into darkness. The other gods lured her out by collecting cockerels to crow, hanging a mirror outside the cave and performing a joyous dance, which made Amaterasu curious. When she looked out, she saw her reflection in the mirror, thus restoring sunlight to the world. Amaterasu is worshipped at the Grand Shrine of Ise, one of the most important Shinto shrines in Japan. Although it has ancient roots, it is never more than 20 years old: beginning in the seventh century, the shrine is rebuilt every 20 years (with some gaps during the Warring State era) to demonstrate the continued importance of Amaterasu.

        "target_summary": "Across cultures and throughout history, the radiant Sun has universally attained divine status, revered as the celestial provider of light, warmth, and life itself. Its indispensable role in agriculture, survival, and the rhythm of day and night positioned sun gods and goddesses as paramount figures in their pantheons. These powerful deities often embodied justice, wisdom, and life-giving energy, commonly imagined traversing the heavens in brilliant chariots or bravely battling nightly underworld forces to guarantee the next dawn, giving rise to a rich tapestry of myths worldwide.\n\nFrom the classical world, **Greek mythology** venerated Helios, the personification of the physical Sun, who splendidly drove his fiery, horse-drawn chariot across the firmament daily, a deity so significant he was once immortalized by the monumental Colossus of Rhodes. His cousin, Apollo, represented the more ethereal aspects of light: enlightenment, prophecy, and healing, often depicted as a youthful, lyre-playing god, wielding both artistic enchantment and fearsome retribution. Similarly, the **Romans** acknowledged Sol, who shared the motif of a solar chariot, later seeing the cult of Sol Invictus, the \"unconquered Sun,\" rise to prominence, celebrated on December 25th until the advent of Christianity.\n\nAcross ancient lands, **Hinduism's** luminous god Surya stood among five major Vedic deities, symbolizing all life itself. His distinctive chariot, drawn by seven horses or a singular seven-headed steed, marked the passage of days, his divine essence so profound that godly weapons were forged from his essence. In **ancient Egypt**, Ra, the revered falcon-headed god crowned with a blazing solar disk, embodied the very Sun, journeying across the sky in sacred boats and bravely descending into the underworld each night to confront the monstrous serpent Apophis, ensuring life's continuation. In a radical, though fleeting, shift, Pharaoh Akhenaten briefly elevated Aten, the sun's bare disk, to a monotheistic supreme being, depicted by life-giving rays culminating in hands.\n\nFurther enriching this global tapestry, the **Fon people of West Africa** worshipped Lisa, the dynamic Sun god who, paired with his twin sister Mawu (the Moon), harmonized day and night and was credited with imparting vital craftsmanship skills. The **Aztecs** ardently revered Huitzilopochtli, a fierce god of both Sun and war and patron of Tenochtitlan, often depicted as a hummingbird warrior. Another Aztec solar deity, Tonatiuh, represented the \"Fifth Sun,\" whose arduous daily journey, born from divine self-sacrifice, was believed to require continuous sustenance through ritual blood offerings.\n\nIn the **Andes**, the **Incan** god Inti, rendered as a golden disk with a human visage, was central to their empire, believed to be the direct ancestor of the Sapa Inca, thus legitimizing imperial authority. His grand winter solstice festival, Inti Raymi, heralded the return of the sun and the revitalization of life. The **Mayan** god Kinich Ahau, often portrayed as an aged figure or a powerful jaguar, journeyed through the heavens by day and the underworld by night, wielding power over disease and drought.\n\nEastern mythologies contribute their own vibrant narratives: **Chinese mythology** presented Xihe, the revered mother of Ten Suns, each a three-legged crow chosen daily to illuminate the world. A dramatic legend recounts the archer Hou Yi shooting down nine Suns when they collectively threatened Earth, leaving just one to provide warmth. In **Japanese Shinto**, Amaterasu, the resplendent Sun goddess and queen of heaven, holds supreme importance as the ancestress of the imperial line. When her wrath led her to retreat into a cave, plunging the world into darkness, the other gods cleverly orchestrated her return, restoring light to the world.\n\nFrom **Mesopotamia**, Shamash (Utu), an all-seeing deity, presided over the Sun and divine justice, often appearing in legal texts and famously carved onto the Code of Hammurabi, symbolizing his unwavering authority. Finally, **Norse mythology** tells of Sól, the Sun goddess, compelled to race across the sky in her horse-drawn chariot, in eternal pursuit by the ravenous wolf Skoll, a relentless chase destined to culminate in the cosmic event of Ragnarök.\n\nThis intricate global exploration vividly illustrates humanity's profound awe and gratitude for the Sun's life-giving power, weaving its celestial presence into the very fabric of diverse spiritual beliefs and cultural identities.",

        "title": "A perilous game of hide and seek: the history of priest holes and hunters",
        "content": "Sixteenth-century Tudor England under Elizabeth I was a dangerous place for those who practised the Catholic faith. Ad How did leaders of this forbidden religion hide? The answer was priest holes, secret hiding spots built into people s homes that offered refuge to those who needed it. Why were priest holes needed? The creation of priest holes can be traced back to the Reformation. When the Pope refused to grant Henry VIII an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, he split from the Catholic Church and founded the Church of England. His son, Edward VI, in an effort to continue his father s work and solidify England as a Protestant state, commissioned Archbishop Thomas Cranmer in 1549 to write the Book of Common Prayer. However, Edward was soon succeeded by his half-sister Mary in 1553, who restored England to Catholicism. Those who refused to renounce their Protestant faith were burned at the stake, earning her the divisive nickname  Bloody Mary . When it was Elizabeth I s turn to rule, she reverted back to Protestantism, restoring the Church of England her father had established and passing the Act of Uniformity in 1559. Originally, non-conformists faced fines and imprisonment, but as plots emerged to overthrow Elizabeth in favour of her Catholic cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, the penalties became harsher. From 1559, it became high treason for a Catholic priest to even enter England, and anyone aiding them faced severe punishment.  Many people, wealthy and poor in England, believed that Catholicism was the true faith and attempted to keep practising it,  explains Stephanie Barczewski on an episode of the HistoryExtra podcast.  So priests would sneak into the country, very much at peril of their own lives, and would then find refuge in the houses of wealthy people.  What were priest holes used for? Looking down into a priest hole in Boscobel House, Shropshire. In 1651, Charles II used this as a hiding place from the Roundheads. (Photo by Alamy) Priest holes were secret hiding spots built into people s homes, to conceal Catholic clergy during government raids. These hides also stored Catholic paraphernalia such as candles, crucifixes and incense. The hiding places would often be very small, and came in a variety of forms: they could be behind wall panels, or high up in the attics of a house. Those using these priest holes would have to escape pursuivants, or  priest hunters . The people in this role conducted thorough searches under Elizabeth I s orders. Pursuivants would compare the number of windows outside and inside, rip up floorboards, and tap walls to detect hollow spaces. They even pretended to leave to see if anyone would emerge, or stayed in the vicinity of suspected hideouts for weeks to force hidden priests to reveal themselves. Unable to escape for fear of being executed, many died of starvation. Those who were found met a gruesome end:  You would have these episodes of terrible violence where they would be dragged out,  explains Barczewski.  [They were] usually not executed on the spot, but would be taken away, put on some sort of trial which there was a foregone conclusion as to how it was going to come out and then they would be executed, not in a humane way [ ] beheaded, drawn, quartered, the full early modern spectacle.  What did priest holes look like? The design of priest holes varied greatly, but they had one thing in common: these hides were often cramped, allowing no room to stand or stretch. Harvington Hall in Worcestershire showcases a great range of priest holes. Among the seven known to exist in the house, there is one above a bread oven packed with a layer of earth to prevent burning, another hidden behind a wall accessed via a swing-out beam covered with panelling, and a hide in an attic reached through a false chimney. Underground hides were rare but did exist, such as the one at Baddesley Clinton in Warwickshire, which is located below the house in the original sewers. It was accessed via the shaft of a garderobe (a medieval toilet). Who was the most famous priest hole maker? Nicholas Owen was known for his masterful priest holes. He began designing and building them in the 1580s   and was known for his ability to baffle even the canniest of priest hunters. He worked under the alias of  Little John , usually in the dead of night or under the ruse of a different construction project, to avoid detection. Owen is also credited as the mastermind of Jesuit Father John Gerard s escape from the Tower of London in 1597. Despite Gerard s hands being mangled from torture, he managed to pull himself across a rope suspended over its moat. However, Owen was captured by the Queen s forces in 1606, during the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot, and taken to the Tower of London. By this point, he had suffered from ill health   including a limp from a poorly set bone. There were rules in place to prevent the torture of those with physical impairments, but this didn t stop Robert Cecil demanding that Owen be taken to the Tower of London and tortured to encourage him giving up knowledge. Richard Topcliffe   an infamous torturer in the Tower of London under Elizabeth I   put Owen on the rack. The torture of a prisoner on the rack in sixteenth-century England. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) After several days of torture, he remained silent, so the torturers kept adding weight to his feet in frustration. Eventually, Owen s intestines bulged out through a hernia. Topcliffe ordered that they be secured by a metal plate, which led to Owen bleeding to death in his cell and dying the next day. The state announced that he had taken his own life. Ad He was canonised in 1970 as St Nicholas Owen, the patron saint of illusionists and escapologists.",
        "target_summary": "In the perilous landscape of sixteenth-century Tudor England under Elizabeth I, adherence to the Catholic faith became an act of treason, giving rise to the ingenious yet desperate necessity of \"priest holes.\" These clandestine sanctuaries, built into private homes, offered fleeting refuge to persecuted clergy and their sacred objects. Their emergence was rooted in the tumultuous religious shifts initiated by King Henry VIII's dramatic split from Rome. After periods of Protestant reform and brutal Catholic restoration, Elizabeth I's re-establishment of the Church of England led to intensified anti-Catholic laws. As plots against her, often involving her Catholic cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, heightened, merely entering England as a Catholic priest became an act of high treason, with those harboring them facing dire consequences. Despite the extreme peril, many devout English families secretly continued their faith, sheltering priests who risked their lives to minister.\n\nThese ingeniously hidden priest holes, often no more than cramped, dark voids, ranged from concealed compartments behind wall panels or within attics, to more elaborate constructions like false chimneys or rare underground passages accessed through old sewers. They concealed not only priests but also sacred paraphernalia during sudden government raids. The threat came from relentless \"pursuivants,\" or priest hunters, who scoured houses with chilling thoroughness, comparing window counts, ripping up floorboards, and tapping walls for hollow spaces. Many hidden priests perished from starvation, while those discovered faced a gruesome fate: dragged out, subjected to show trials, and then brutally executed through beheading, drawing, and quartering – a horrifying public spectacle.\n\nThe most celebrated architect of these secret spaces was Nicholas Owen, known as \"Little John.\" From the 1580s, Owen’s unparalleled skill baffled even the most cunning priest hunters. Working secretly, he crafted intricate hides, famously aiding Jesuit Father John Gerard's daring escape from the Tower of London. However, Owen himself was captured in 1606. Despite ill health and physical impairments, he was subjected to prolonged, brutal torture on the rack in the Tower. Through days of unimaginable suffering, Owen steadfastly refused to betray his fellow Catholics. His torturers, frustrated by his unwavering silence, continued to add weight until his intestines ruptured, leading to his death. His sacrifice, officially covered up as suicide, eventually led to his canonisation centuries later as St Nicholas Owen, patron saint of illusionists and escapologists.",

        "content": "On 2 June 1780, a crowd of between 40,000 to 60,000 people gathered outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, having marched from St George s Fields, to present a petition. Though soldiers managed to disperse the masses and arrest some of their number, this was just the beginning. Ad Over the next five days, this protest escalated into the most destructive riots in London s history. Protestors attacked buildings, including Newgate Prison and the Bank of England, and many lives were lost. But what drove these people to such violent action? What caused the Gordon Riots? The burning of Newgate Prison. (Photo by The Print Collector/Getty Images) The Gordon Riots were fuelled by Protestant opposition to the Catholic Relief Act of 1778. This legislation lifted many restrictions on the civil rights of Catholics that had been imposed by the Popery Act of 1698. With reduced legislative discrimination, Catholics were able to join the army and buy or sell land if they took an oath of allegiance. Lord George Gordon, a British politician and Protestant, vehemently opposed this, and his opposition was shared by many other Protestants. They feared that these newfound freedoms would enable Catholics to commit treasonous acts and jeopardise British security. On the podcast | Britain's Catholic emancipation To counter this, Lord Gordon initiated a petition to repeal the Catholic Relief Act, which he claimed to have 120,000 signatures. On 2 June, he led a group of between 40,000 and 60,000 to Parliament, then under the administration of prime minister Lord North, to present it. Lord Gordon entered the Houses of Parliament and presented the petition himself. He and the protestors demanded immediate consideration of their request; this was denied by parliament, but a discussion was scheduled for the following Tuesday. However, this didn t placate the crowds, and what began as a civil petition soon descended into violent riots. Why were they called the Gordon Riots? The Gordon Riots were named after Lord George Gordon, who organised the petition against the Catholic Relief Act. The son of the 3rd Duke of Gordon, he was a politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1774 to 1780. A year before the Gordon Riots, in 1779, he became the first president of the Protestant Association, which was formed as an immediate response to the Act. It had the support of notable religious figures, including Rowland Hill and John Rippon. How violent were the Gordon Riots? Rioters accosting Lord William Mansfield. (Photo by Culture Club/Getty Images) The Gordon Riots were among the most destructive in English history. The violence began on 2 June, when the crowd attacked the carriages of Members of Parliament as they arrived at Westminster, holding them personally responsible for the Catholic Relief Act. Lord Chief Justice Mansfield s carriage was damaged and the glass shattered, while the Duke of Northumberland had his watch stolen. Many MPs also had their homes ransacked. Lord Mansfield s residence was attacked and his extensive library burned, resulting in significant financial loss. Rioters also targeted his country estate, Kenwood House on Hampstead Heath, but were diverted by a guard who bribed them with free ale at a nearby inn. Over the following days, rioters also targeted government buildings, including Newgate Prison, where some members of the original crowd outside parliament were being held. Dr Madeleine Pelling has written on the role that graffiti played in the riots, and how some in the crowd painted a battle cry across the prison s crumbling walls:  His Majesty King Mob.  The rioters freed 300 prisoners   many of whom would never be recaptured. The Spaniard's Inn, Hampstead. (Photo by Bridgeman via Getty Images) On 7 June, known as  Black Wednesday , the riot peaked with an attempt to destroy the Bank of England. One journal, the Annual Register, called it  one of the most dreadful spectacles this country ever beheld,  adding that  every thing served to impress the mind with ideas of universal anarchy and approaching desolation (sic).  In response, martial law was enacted, allowing thousands of troops to shoot rioters on site. By this point, Lord George Gordon tried to calm and disperse the rioters, but his efforts were in vain. He declared his wish to  join the forces of law and order , turning against the crowd. Groups like this would have been read the Riot Act, which was passed in 1714 in response to the increasing number of mobs in Britain. When crowds gathered, Jonny Wilkes explains,  a public official would have to stand before them   either a brave or foolhardy thing to do . They read the following proclamation of the Riot Act:  Our sovereign Lord the King chargeth and commandeth all persons, being assembled, immediately to disperse themselves, and peaceably to depart to their habitations, or to their lawful business, upon the pains contained in the act made in the first year of King George, for preventing tumults and riotous assemblies. God save the King.  Those who didn t disperse after this proclamation were dealt harsh penalties. During that night and the following day, 285 people were shot dead by the militia, another 200 wounded, and around 450 arrested. Notably, none of those arrested had signed the petition, suggesting that this riot had grown far beyond the original protest outside the Houses of Parliament. By Thursday evening, 8 June, following the arrests and deaths of many, the rioting had subsided. What happened to those who took part in the riots? Lord George Gordon during his imprisonment the Tower of London, 1780, convicted of high treason for his role in instigating The Gordon Riots. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Out of the 450 arrested for their part in the Gordon Riots, 160 were tried at either the King s Bench court in Southwark, or the Old Bailey. Of these, 26 were hanged for their involvement in the riots. Lord George Gordon was imprisoned for eight months and tried for high treason in 1781. His cousin, a lawyer named Thomas Erskine, successfully argued for his acquittal, citing his lack of treasonous intent. Although Gordon had led the protestors originally to the Houses of Parliament, Erskine argued, he did not explicitly order the riots.  | Timeline: a history of prisons in Britain However, Gordon s legal troubles continued. In 1787, he published a paper criticising the severity of criminal law in England, also making derogatory comments about queen consort of France Marie Antoinette and Jean-Balthazar d Adh mar, the French ambassador to Great Britain. For this crime, he was given a five-year jail sentence at Newgate on 28 January 1788, where he died in 1793 from typhoid. Did anything change as a result of the Gordon Riots? The Gordon Riots made other European countries question the stability of the British government, which was significant as Britain sought to solidify European alliances. In fact, the Spanish government, upon learning of the riots, retreated from its peace negotiations with Britain. This event also underscored the power of popular dissent, which was eventually restrained with the 1795 Grenville and Pitt Bills, otherwise known as the  Gagging Acts , to prevent mass meetings and petitions. Ad These measures reflected a cautious approach to public gatherings, a legacy that continues to influence the use of protest and petitions today.",
        "target_summary": "In June 1780, London was plunged into chaos as the Gordon Riots, fueled by fervent anti-Catholic sentiment, erupted into the most destructive civil unrest in the city's history.

        "title": "Who was Saint Valentine and was he real? A history of the figure's origins",
        "content": "Practically everyone in the English-speaking world knows about Valentine s Day. Celebrants buy more chocolates, flowers and jewellery on 14 February than on any other day of the year and only Christmas occasions more greeting cards. So what is the history behind this commercial celebration? Ad What is Saint Valentine the patron saint of? Catholics still regard Valentine as the patron saint of engaged couples; happy marriages; love; and lovers. Yet a patron saint of love and lovers is not exactly compatible with Christian doctrine, which has always emphasised the joys of self-denial. Celibacy has been a requirement for priesthood since the Middle Ages, and virginity won sainthood for hundreds of women. Therefore, a saint who sponsors the exchange of candy and kisses between lovers seems doctrinally dubious. So where did this saint come from, and how did he become the impresario of sweethearts? Who was the real Saint Valentine? If you consult Wikipedia or Catholic Encyclopedia, or more popular digital publications such as Buzzfeed and History.com, you will read that Valentine lived in the third century, was either a priest or a bishop in Rome, and was jailed by the Roman emperor for being a Christian in the period when the religion remained illegal. A 19th-century depiction of St Valentine, here shown as a bishop of Terni. (Image by Getty Images) Catholic news sites claim that Valentine s crime was performing marriage rites for Christian lovers; alternatively, some say he carried messages between jailed Christians and, before he was executed, left a letter to a young woman signed  your Valentine . But if you dig a bit deeper to read the ancient documents, another Valentine appears. In fact, it turns out there were quite a few Valentines in the Roman Empire. The name was popular among Christians and others because it means  powerful  or  worthy . It turns out there were quite a few Valentines in the Roman Empire It seems that three different martyrs named Valentinus died on 14 February during the reign of Emperor Claudius Gothicus (r268 270); none of whom married Christian couples or carried messages between jailed Christians. One was a general stationed in Africa. The martyrologies (lists of martyrs organised by death date) say only that  In Africa Valentini & militum viginti quatuor [He perished] in Africa with two dozen troops . We know nothing more about him. The second was Bishop Valentinus of Terni, a town about 70 miles northeast of Rome; and the third was a Roman priest. According to the vitae (hagiographies) of the latter two, they both performed miraculous cures, debated with pagan jailors, and lost their heads in Rome. Bishop Valentinus of Terni: the real Saint Valentine? According to his fifth- or sixth-century hagiographer, Bishop Valentinus of Terni was summoned to Rome sometime in the 260s to cure the son of a rhetor [or orator] named Craton, who kept a school and housed visiting Greek scholars. His son Chaeremon, who was also a budding student of philosophy, had contracted a debilitating sickness that curved his spine and prevented him from walking, and Craton learned that the cleric had healed similar cases. But when he arrived, Bishop Valentine first tried to persuade Craton to become a Christian. Craton, trained in Hellenistic philosophy [Greek philosophy during the period running from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC to the end of the Roman Republic in 31 BC, known as the Hellenistic Age], found the tenets of Christianity to be illogical and ridiculous.  How can water, which washes filth off the body, clean away sins?!  he demanded. The debate dragged on as Chaeremon lay suffering and dying until Craton desperately struck a deal. If Valentine cured the boy, Craton s entire household would convert. Valentine then spent the night praying alone with Chaeremon. The next morning, Chaeremon appeared hale and hearty. Everyone, including Craton, his family, servants, and the visiting Greeks, accepted baptism. When the Roman senate got wind of the business they promptly arrested Valentine, had him beaten, and then decapitated. The visiting scholars took the martyr s body back to Terni to bury it. Unfortunately, Roman soldiers caught them and beheaded them as well. A third Valentinus The third Valentinus, according to his vita, was a priest of Rome also arrested for preaching Christianity in the time of Claudius Gothicus [Roman emperor 268 270]. As several modern scholars have pointed out, Claudius was hardly ever in Rome   he earned his name by fighting off invading Germanic barbarians up north   and he never ordered a persecution of Christians. Whatever the priest Valentinus did to annoy the government, he was supposedly hauled before Claudius and he took the opportunity to preach. Claudius seemed rather interested at first, but a prefect named Calpurnius warned the emperor:  You are being seduced into a false religion!  A 15th-century illumination showing Saint Valentine (far left), Saint Stephen and Saint Maximilian. (Image by Getty Images) Claudius sent Valentine into house arrest at the home of an aristocrat named Asterius, who was promised riches if he could subdue the priest with arguments against Christianity. Of course, Valentine began preaching the minute he arrived at the house, discoursing on Christ as the light of the world. Asterius replied that he had a blind daughter, and said if Valentine s god could open her eyes to the light of day, Asterius would become a Christian. Valentine lay hands on the girl s eyes and prayed that she might see the light. When she opened her eyes and looked around her, Asterius fell to Valentine s feet and begged to be saved. Valentine quickly began baptising everyone around him, making 44 new Christians from Asterius s household. But Claudius soon found out and had them all thrown in prison. Valentine was beheaded, along with several others who became renowned as martyrs. Visiting Valentine as a cure for illness None of the three Valentine s biographies was earlier than the fifth century   that s at least 200 years after any of the saints supposedly lived. Neither written nor material evidence from the pre-medieval period associates any of these Valentines with love or lovers. The word  amor , Latin for  love , doesn t appear in the texts. Even when promoting their God, the two better-known Valentines never spoke in terms of affection but only faith and illumination. Instead, they became known in subsequent centuries for curing those who suffered, as Chaeremon did, from  falling sickness    that is, epilepsy. Pilgrims, lured by the legends, came to visit the graves of both Valentines for cures, not for love. Religious tourists made the rounds of martyrs  burials, praying for the saints  help with illness and for intercession with God. Some went to Bishop Valentine of Terni lying quietly in his Umbrian tomb outside the city of his birth. Others attended the Roman Valentine who was supposedly buried in a crypt near the site of his execution, just outside the city walls on the Via Flaminia of Rome. Devotees of Roman Valentine may have built a church over his grave as early as the fourth century, though more likely it was named after the much richer Valentine who funded it. They began calling the city gate there Valentine s Gate (today it is known as the Porta del Populo.) Nineteenth-century excavations at the site revealed fourth- and fifth-century burials as well as fragments inscribed with Valentine s name. After some centuries, either pilgrims sought other saints, or Valentine s shrine declined when Pope Nicholas IV (died in 1292) ordered that Valentine s body be moved to a new home at Santa Prassede, a flourishing parish centre where many other saints  remains were housed. Throughout the European Middle Ages, Valentine remained no more or less popular than other ancient Roman martyrs. Every 14 February, church lectors across Europe read out the life of one or the other or both Valentines. Medieval writers sometimes mixed up their Valentines, attributing the miracles of one to another. When did Valentine become a saint? Eventually, some medieval scholars grew suspicious about the striking similarities between the stories of the bishop and the priest. They knew that after the empire dwindled, Rome had become a ruined pile of broken, nameless graves, where anyone might reclaim the bones of a  martyr . Bishops and abbots eager for relics did not always properly authenticate the remains of bodies; the shreds of blood-soaked cloth; and the other objects hauled out of crypts and sent northward as relics. Hagiographers, sensing an opportunity, revised saints  legends to advertise the presence of relics in their churches. One Breton bishop recorded the slew of miracles that enriched Valentine s reputation at the end of the 11th century, when the saint s skull somehow ended up in Roquemaure, where it was exhibited every year on his feast day. That same skull later went to Tarragona, while other bits of the Valentines turned up all over Europe: a skull remains on display in the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome; Saint Anton s church in Madrid has some bones, as does Santa Maria Assunta in Savona; and a Carmelite church in Dublin. There s also a bone in Prague (SS. Peter and Paul); a chunk of skull in Chelmno (St Mary s Assumption); and other slivers in: the parish church of the Oratory in Birmingham (England   look under the St Athanasius altar); Glasgow (Church of Blessed Saint John Duns Scotus); and in the Church of Metastasis of Virgin Mary in Mytilene, on the island of Lesbos. The Stephansdom in Vienna brashly claims to have the whole body. Neither inscriptions on reliquaries that housed his bones, nor sculpture or pictures betrayed Valentine s association with love. Illuminations and sculptures of Valentine typically showed him as a bishop with staff or a tonsured monk holding a book. In early printed volumes of the 16th century, Valentine often bent over victims of epilepsy or plague. Other scenes depicted eager executioners chopping off his head. Not a single picture showed the saint passing messages or marrying lovers. Valentine himself appeared more stern than romantic. When did Saint Valentine become associated with love? Modern literary scholars credit one man for turning Valentine into the patron of love: Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales and other poetic works. Chaucer s Parlement of Foules [aka Parliament of Fowls], an allegorical tale thought to have been written during the negotiations of Richard II s marriage to Anne of Bohemia in 1380, mentioned  seynt Volantynys day/ Whan euery bryd comyth there to chese his make. [Saint Valentine s day, when every bird comes there to choose his mate.]  Bird love apparently occurred on Valentine s feast day at the start of the English spring. Chaucer was a major influencer in his day   after him, everyone began calling their beloved 'Valentine' Chaucer may have read the hagiographies of Valentine in local English versions. He may have been aware, too, that yet another head of Valentine lay at Hyde Abbey, just outside the walls of Winchester, as literary scholar Jack Oruch has pointed out ( Saint Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February , Speculum 56:3 [1981]). But the love connection was Chaucer s creation. Chaucer was a major influencer in his day   after him, everyone began calling their beloved  Valentine  and writing love poems on 14 February. Literary acquaintances of Chaucer were among the first to do so in print. Oton de Granson III (died c1397), for instance, wrote three long complainctes to Saint Valentine, as well as poems about the  Wish  and  Dream  of Valentine; while John Gower (died in 1408), who wrote copiously about love, referred to Valentine in two of his ballades. Across the water, Christine de Pizan in her Dit de la Rose described how French knights formed a fictional Order of the Rose on Saint Valentine s Day. Geoffrey Chaucer (c1340-1400) depicted as a pilgrim on horseback in a detail from an early illuminated manuscript edition of 'The Canterbury Tales'. (Image by Getty Images) The religious studies scholar Leigh Schmidt has suggested that Valentine remained important to churchgoers and those who suffered epilepsy as a martyr who died on 14 February ( The Fashioning of a Modern Holiday , Winterthur Portfolio 28:4 [1993]). The Anglican Book of Common Prayer explained that Saint Valentine was  famous for his love and charity , and thus a suitable sponsor of romance. When were the first Valentine s cards? Valentine became more popular as a patron of love and lovers in two contexts: among aristocratic circles and in folk custom. Poets such as William Shakespeare and John Donne continued Chaucer s tradition of using Valentine and his day as symbols of love. While they composed verses to honour the holiday, others exchanged gifts. In rural communities, meanwhile, men and women got together on Valentine s Day to make merry and play games, such as drawing lots for Valentines sweethearts and divination   conjuring up the identity of one s future spouse. By the 19th century, English consumers were ready and eager for Valentine's cards with poems already printed on them, preferably decorated with love birds, hearts and Cupid (rather than the image of a headless Roman bishop). A 19th-century Valentine card. (Image by Getty Images) The London Journal of 1858 supported the custom of exchanging observance love tokens on Valentine s Day, declaring that it was both  natural  and  proper  that, at the start of spring,  the predominating sentiment in the human mind should be the sentiment of love; and to this accordingly the anniversary of our saint is directed . However, the publication preferred home-made cards to mass-produced Valentines, about which the editors opined:  If we were to give a general character, we would say they are very trashy and not a little vulgar; and  the production of mercenaries for hire.  It s probably a good thing that the Journal s editors never saw today s variety of Valentine advertisements, cards, decorations and gifts. Are there ancient associations between Valentine and love? Despite the evidence for Chaucer s transformation of Valentine s Day, some scholars have continued to seek ancient causes for Valentine s modern associations with passion and romance. In the 19th century, historians scoured the sources of classical history for evidence of celebrations in mid-February. They found Lupercalia, a holiday associated with Faunus or Pan, celebrated with a carnival on the Ides of February (15 February.) Colleges or clubs of young noblemen sacrificed goats or dogs on an altar in the cave where, according to legend, Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, were suckled by the famous she-wolf. According to Plutarch, they cut strips for thongs from the bloody hides and ran half-naked around the Palatine hill of Rome, striking nubile women with their thongs to confer fertility. Supposedly, the young men also drew lots for sexual partners.  | A brief guide to ancient Rome and the Romans, plus 9 fascinating facts After Romans became Christians, Pope Gelasius I (d496) prohibited celebrations of Lupercalia and, according to these same modern scholars, substituted the more chaste celebration of a Valentine s feast day. Other recent scholars have blamed instead Emperor Claudius, who allegedly banned young men from getting married in the third century. Claudius needed more soldiers for his campaigns, so the argument goes, hence soldiers were required by law to remain single while serving. In this version of Valentine s saintly past, Valentine heroically resisted the emperor and married Christian couples. Yet in reality, Claudius never forbade marriage because he was too busy securing his eastern frontier to decree laws in Rome. These explanations for Valentine s Day remain far more popular than the  Chaucer Theory . Updated hagiographies of Valentine and church websites report as facts that an identifiable third-century bishop named Valentine offended the Roman emperor by marrying soldiers and their lovers, and/or passing notes among jailed lovers, and paid for it with his life. Mainstream digital publications claiming to reveal the  true story of the real Saint Valentine  tell similar stories (although those authors who research as far as Wikipedia mention Chaucer s influence). How ironic that modern celebrants have chosen Cupid   Greco-Roman god of erotic love   as one of the major symbols of the day when Saint Valentine lost his head. Why was Valentine removed as an official saint? Unfortunately, Valentine s revised legend probably caused his loss of saintly status in the modern Catholic church. The Vatican removed Valentine from its universal calendar of saints in 1969 because his legend lacked historical evidence. Catholics are still free to venerate the patron saint of epilepsy if they wish, but it is not a liturgical obligation. Like the rest of the world, devout fans of the saint are free to focus instead on choosing cards and gifts for their loved ones, although believers have found a way to honour the ancient saint and, at the same time, celebrate the holiday of love. At Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Dublin, the Franciscan church that claims to have relics of Valentine, petitioners leave notes to the saint begging for guidance, cures, and love.  Dear Valentine May I find a nice man to settle down with,  pleads one.  Saint Valentine may I please meet Annabelle again,  asks another (Irish Times, 8 February 2014). By the 19th century, English consumers were ready and eager for Valentine's cards with poems already printed on them. (Image by Getty Images) We don t know who the real Valentine was, because our best evidence consists of legends   ancient Christian legends; legends of burials and relics; legends of mating birds and love lotteries; of pagan debauches and wholesome romance. No one is sure exactly who Valentine (or Valentines) was (or were); or why Christians of late antiquity came to revere him. Meanwhile, the myth-making continues. In 2017, a Brazilian forensic anthropologist used photos of the skull fragment kept in Santa Maria in Cosmedin and reconstructed the face of Saint Valentine (MailOnline, 13 February 2017)   but which one? Ad This article was first published in 2019 and updated in February 2024",
        "target_summary": "Valentine's Day, a global phenomenon showering commercial success on chocolates and cards every February 14th, paradoxically celebrates a patron saint of love whose historical grounding is highly dubious. While popular narratives depict Saint Valentine as a 3rd-century Roman priest or bishop martyred for secretly marrying Christian lovers or aiding the persecuted, deeper historical inquiry reveals a more complex and elusive truth.\n\nThe name \"Valentinus\" was common in the Roman Empire, and evidence points to at least three different martyrs dying on February 14th during Emperor Claudius Gothicus's reign. These included a general in Africa, a bishop of Terni, and a Roman priest. Accounts of the latter two, written centuries after their supposed deaths, describe them performing miraculous cures and converting pagans, leading to their brutal executions. Bishop Valentinus of Terni healed a rhetor's son, converting his entire household before being beheaded by the Roman senate. The Roman priest Valentinus similarly restored sight to a blind girl, leading to his and 44 others' martyrdom. Crucially, none of these early hagiographies or any pre-medieval evidence associate these figures with romantic love; instead, they were revered for curing epilepsy and other ailments, drawing pilgrims to their graves for healing.\n\nThe romantic association with Valentine's Day primarily emerged much later, largely credited to the English poet Geoffrey Chaucer's *Parlement of Foules* around 1380. Chaucer's allegorical poem linked Saint Valentine's Day to birds choosing mates in early spring, a concept that significantly influenced literary circles and popular culture. Subsequently, poets like Shakespeare and Donne continued this tradition, and folk customs evolved, leading to the exchange of love tokens and cards, particularly in the 19th century, adorned with symbols like Cupid and hearts rather than the martyred bishop.\n\nDespite popular theories attempting to link Valentine's Day to ancient pagan fertility rites like Lupercalia or to Emperor Claudius's alleged ban on soldier marriages (both largely debunked by scholars), the enduring image of Valentine as a patron of lovers remains. However, due to the lack of historical evidence for these romantic legends, the Vatican removed Saint Valentine from its universal calendar of saints in 1969, making his veneration optional. Nevertheless, the myths continue, with devotees still seeking his intercession for love and guidance, underscoring the powerful blend of legend, literature, and cultural tradition that shapes this global celebration.",

        "content": "Ad Early Jewish settlement 19th century Palestine did not formally exist as a country before the First World War, when the British fixed Palestine s borders after their conquest of what would become Iraq, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. For hundreds of years before the British took control, Palestine had been divided into provinces of the Ottoman empire, and had very few Jewish inhabitants. Indeed, at the start of the 19th century the Jewish population of the territory soon to be defined as Palestine was small   only about 3%. The majority of the region s inhabitants were Arabs, mostly Sunni Muslim, who had occupied the region since the seventh-century Arab conquest; there was also a sizeable Christian minority. Together, these formed the population that would be considered   despite the lack of a formally recognised country   as Palestinians. The Jewish people of Palestine in 1800 were not farmers or settlers but instead lived in towns and worked as merchants or religious teachers. As the 19th century progressed, European Jews   influenced by the rise of nationalism in Europe   began to look to Palestine as the place for a possible Jewish homeland. A wave of Jewish people came to the country in an Aliyah ( ascent ) starting in the 1880s, making their homes on land bought from Palestinians. This brought a new type of Jew to Palestine, there to settle the land; these adopted tough new names such as Oz ( strength ). More settlers followed as Jewish people fled anti-Semitic pogroms in Europe, a situation exacerbated by the rise of rightwing sentiment that presaged Nazi rule of Germany from 1933. Settlement was core to Zionism   a Jewish nationalist movement   because it demanded land for a Jewish state. Zionists based their national claim to Palestine on ancient Jewish settlement of the area before the Romans expelled Jews from the region in the second century AD following two major Jewish revolts against their rule. Zionism and Jewish settlement were seen as a return to an ancient Jewish Palestine.  A land without a people for a people without a land  ran a pithy Zionist slogan   yet this was not accurate: the land was already occupied by predominantly Muslim communities. The seeds of conflict 1896 1917 In 1896, an Austro-Hungarian Jewish intellectual, Theodor Herzl, published Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State), a pamphlet outlining the intellectual basis for the idea of a Jewish country. There was initially much discussion among Zionists about whether such a place was to be in Palestine or elsewhere. Early schemes proposed such disparate locations as Canada, parts of South America, and Britishrun East Africa around what is now Uganda and Kenya. European Zionist Jews were looking for a place to make real the Jewish state, and the debate fell between two major camps. The first was willing to accept a Jewish state anywhere, while the other was determined to forge a state in historic Palestine. Theodor Herzl's pamphlet Der Judenstaat (1896), proposing a Jewish country. (Photo 12/Getty Images) In 1905, at the Seventh Zionist Congress in Basel, the dispute was settled in favour of a Jewish state in Palestine rather than some part of the world with no religious or historical connection for Jewish people. Many Palestinians resisted this move to settle in the territory, and expressed their own national identity through channels such as Falastin, a newspaper founded in Jaffa in 1911 and named for their homeland. Other responses were more direct, with Palestinians aggressively targeting landowners who sold land to Jewish settlers. Jewish immigration and settlement set the two communities on the road to war. It would be a struggle in which the Zionists, armed with modern European nationalist ideas, organisation and technologies, had the edge. Riots and revolt 1917 20 In 1917, during the First World War, British-led troops conquered southern Palestine and took Jerusalem. In the same year, the British foreign secretary, AJ Balfour, issued the so-called Balfour Declaration. Sent as a letter to the Jewish (and Zionist) Lord Rothschild on 2 November, and published a week later in The Times, it was a deliberately ambiguous statement of British intent towards Palestine. It did not promise the Jewish people a state in the country; instead, it vaguely expressed the sentiment that  His Majesty s Government view with favour  the establishment of a Jewish  national home  in Palestine, while also recognising that the region had an existing, non-Jewish, population. General Edmund Allenby enters Jerusalem on foot on 11 December 1917 during the British campaign in Palestine against Ottoman forces in the First World War (Heritage Images/Getty Images) The declaration helped Britain s war effort in various ways, boosting support in the United States (which had a significant Jewish population) and providing for British control of Palestine. The Jewish settlers depended on Britain for their survival and, until the Second World War, worked with the British authorities to maintain security in Palestine. Jewish settlement was met with local resistance: in 1920, for instance, rioting broke out as Palestinians opposed British-facilitated Jewish immigration. More violence was to erupt throughout the next two decades. Jewish-European settlers in this period recorded the mood of colonialism.  We must not forget that we are dealing here with a semi-savage people, which has extremely primitive concepts,  one wrote at the time.  And this is his nature: if he senses in you power, he will submit and will hide his hatred for you. And if he senses weakness, he will dominate you.  Amid such colonial views, the British veered between support for Jewish settlers and for the Palestinians. Their goals were diverging and becoming seemingly irreconcilable. Full-scale conflict 1929 47 As violence erupted between the two communities, Jews and Palestinians divided, and people had to take sides. Early Jewish inhabitants in Palestine, and Mizrahi ( oriental  or  eastern ) Jews who came to Palestine from Arab countries and who spoke Arabic, were now confronted by politically mobilised European Jews arriving to settle the land and build a Jewish state. Many of these long-time Jewish occupants of Palestine and the Middle East cut their ties to their Arab neighbours. An outbreak of extreme violence in 1929 dashed any faint hopes of Jews and Palestinians combining, and revisionist rightwing Zionist organisations grew. Palestinians and Jews prepared for a full-scale conflict. Militant Muslim preachers such as Shaykh  Izz al-Din al-Qassam mobilised Palestinians, priming them for jihad. The Jewish population prepared much more thoroughly, building a proto-state alongside nascent political and economic structures, having already established a defence organisation, Haganah. Jewish families evacuate Jerusalem's Old City in 1936, during the Arab Revolt - an uprising that followed several years of violence between Palestinians and Jewish settlers (Universal History Archive/Getty Images) The Jewish community pushed into new land with numerous settlements, and set up a Jewish presence across Palestine. By this point, the Palestinians were in conflict with both the Jews and the British authorities in Palestine, reaching a crescendo in a mass revolt in 1936. The British army crushed the revolt by 1939, but resistance and preparation for further attacks by both communities remained the pattern for the rest of the 1930s and throughout the Second World War. By the time of the Second World War, the British had shifted their policy from support for Zionism to blocking Jewish immigration to Palestine. They did this, again, to bolster support for their war effort, this time from Arab allies. In the face of Jewish people escaping the unfolding Holocaust in Europe, this caused growing resentment and conflict with Zionists who were trying to save European Jews by helping them get to Palestine. After the war ended in 1945, the Jewish population of Palestine had become sufficiently powerful and mobilised to fight Britain, and good Jewish preparation won the day. Jewish terror attacks against British targets helped to force Britain to reconsider its geopolitical priorities. In one of the most infamous attacks, in 1946 the wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem that housed a British headquarters was blown up, killing almost 100 people. In 1947, Britain decided to leave Palestine. Meanwhile, survivors of the Holocaust who emigrated to Palestine further boosted the territory s Jewish population. In the November of the same year, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution that proposed the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. Under the plan, Jerusalem would be an internationalised city. The suggestion was accepted, albeit reluctantly, by Jewish representatives in the region, because it offered some international acceptance of their aims of establishing a state. Palestinian and Arab groups rejected it, however, arguing that it ignored the rights of most of the population of Palestine to decide their own destiny. : Matthew Hughes considers why British colonial forces couldn't cope with a Jewish revolt in the 1940s, prior to the foundation of the State of Israel The birth of modern Israel 1948 49 The First Arab-Israeli War of 1948 49 followed on from the violence between Jews and Palestinians as neighbouring Arab states   for their own political motives as well as to help their Palestinian Arab brethren   intervened in the hostilities. In May 1948, as British troops left Palestine, Zionist leader (soon to become the first Israeli prime minister) David Ben-Gurion declared the formation of the state of Israel, at which point Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan, Lebanon and Syria attacked Israel in support of the Palestinians. Israel was born from war, both the legacy of the Holocaust and more immediate conflict when the Arab armies attacked in May 1948. Fighting against the new Israeli army continued until early 1949. Local Palestinian militia units supported the war effort, but were poorly organised and had little military power. In general, though the Arab forces looked impressive on paper, the military quality of their fighting power and the political unity of their command across different national forces were poor and, as a result, they lost. Palestinian refugees pictured during the first Arab-Israeli War in 1948. At the conclusion of the war the following year, some 700,000 Palestinians had fled or been expelled from the new state of Israel and were refugees in neighbouring territories (Universal History Archive/Getty Images) Israel s success allowed it to expand its territory to include all of British-run Palestine, with the exception of the hilly West Bank next to Jordan, east Jerusalem (including the Old City), and the territory known as the Gaza Strip, running along the Mediterranean Sea just northeast of the Sinai Peninsula. The result of this expansion was that Israel controlled more than 75% of what had formerly been British-run Palestine   or, in other words, the Palestinians now held less than 25% of Palestine. What happened next has informed a great deal of how we now understand the Arab-Israeli conflict. For the Palestinians this was the nakba (catastrophe) that turned hundreds of thousands of them into refugees; for Israel, it was triumph in a war of independence in the face of a full-scale assault against its Jewish people. Both communities saw the events in very different ways. From an Israeli perspective, the Arabs were hell-bent on destroying Israel in 1948, and the war they provoked ended up making thousands of Palestinian people refugees. From a Palestinian viewpoint, the Israelis were acting on a plan to expel them and thus ethnically cleanse the country. Israel did expel Palestinians, but others simply left as their society collapsed under the pressure of war; even so, more than 100,000 Palestinians remained inside Israel after 1949. Massacre was followed by counter-massacre: Jewish forces killed around 100 Palestinian villagers at Deir Yassin, just west of Jerusalem, in April 1948; shortly afterwards, Arab fighters killed some 80 Jewish medical staff near Jerusalem. These massacres reveal how both sides emphasise different historical events, and in different ways. Indeed, histories of this period quickly reveal how divisive this time remains, with accounts often skewed significantly toward one side or another. The conclusion of the First Arab-Israeli War left two significant political problems, both of which remain largely unresolved today. First, more than 700,000 Palestinians now lived in refugee camps in the Egyptian-run Gaza Strip, throughout neighbouring Arab nations, and in the Jordanian-controlled West Bank. Stateless, without passports and dispossessed, theirs was a squalid existence, and no one addressed their lack of political rights. Meanwhile, Israel built a functioning Jewish state, drawing in more Mizrahi Jews who had lived for centuries in Arab countries but who were no longer welcome there. But though the Zionists had realised their ambition of a Jewish state, no Arab states recognised it, meaning that Israel was flanked by hostile neighbours. The consequences of the failure to settle the political needs of both communities were to feed directly into the wars that were to come. Further Arab-Israeli wars 1956 73 Depending on your viewpoint, the causes of the Arab-Israeli wars that followed Israel s formation lie either with an aggressive expansionist Israeli state that preferred war to diplomacy, or with an intransigent Arab front that refused to talk to Israel, wanting instead to eliminate the Jewish state. The Palestinian people were caught in the middle. Israel escalated border tensions in the early 1950s. This led in 1956 to what became known as the Suez Crisis   an invasion by Israeli, British and French forces of Egypt under its dynamic new pan-Arab leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Israelis considered that Nasser started the war by launching attacks into Israel and blockading the port of Eilat, but the war s origins are contested. Israel won the conflict militarily but there was no political resolution, and another war followed little more than a decade later. US president Jimmy Carter witnesses an Arab-Israeli peace treaty in March 1979, flanked by the signatories, Egypt's president Anwar Sadat (left) and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin (Wally McNamee/Getty Images) The conflagration of June 1967 had major consequences. Across six days of fighting, Israeli forces destroyed the armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria, and occupied vast new tracts of land in the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank and Golan Heights. Israeli paratroopers also took east Jerusalem, which included the Old City, home to holy sites such as the Jewish Western Wall and the area known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount.  about the Six-Day war This was a stunning military success for Israel, but the 1967 war also led to political change. A messianic, less secular, settler-based Zionism grew in the recently conquered West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan. These settlers formed Gush Emunim ( Bloc of the Faithful ) in 1974 as an orthodox activist organisation to reflect the new mood in Zionism, while Israel s Jews divided into the more secular versus the more religious. Meanwhile, humiliated, the Arabs refused to accept their defeat. The result was yet another conflict: the Yom Kippur War in 1973, named for the Jewish holy day of atonement, on which Egyptian and Syrian forces attacked. Though this war proved more successful for the Arabs in its initial phases, the Israelis successfully counter-attacked. The conflict led Israel and Egypt to sign a peace treaty in 1979. Despite a historic visit to Israel by the Egyptian leader, Anwar Sadat, the issues underpinning the conflict had still not been fundamentally resolved. The Palestinians remained without a state, and their war went on. Indeed, after the peace with Egypt, Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to attack Palestinian fighters based there. They remained in southern Lebanon, finally pulling out in 2000 when faced with a new foe in the shape of Lebanese Muslim Shia militia forces such as Hezbollah.  | What was Golda Meir's role in the Yom Kippur War Stalemate and resolution 1987 96 The lack of any wider political progress had provoked simmering anger among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza territory occupied by Israel in 1967. In 1987, this finally erupted into a full-scale uprising in Gaza   the intifada   which soon spread to the West Bank. Mass riots saw people, including children, throwing stones at Israeli troops and tanks. Soldiers responded with physical violence, some aimed at the children, and with lethal force. The resulting images, beamed around the world, were terrible PR for the Israelis. Israel s military power was not so effective against unarmed demonstrators as it was against conventional armies. The asymmetric battle between hi-tech weapons and stone-throwers revealed that the side that seemingly holds more power does not always get what it wants. This helped to push the two sides to talk, and Yasser Arafat for the Palestinians and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin eventually forged a deal   of sorts. Young Palestinians flee Israeli soldiers during riots in Gaza City in 1993. The violence of the Palestinian intifada (uprising) eased briefly when the Oslo Peace Accords were signed in September 1993 (PATRICK BAZ/Getty Images) In 1993, the two sides signed a deal that was marked, historically, by Arafat shaking hands with Rabin on the lawn of the White House in Washington DC in front of the US president. It was a significant moment for Rabin who, for many years, had seen Arafat as an implacable terrorist foe. The window of peace opened briefly, and then closed. One view of why talks failed is that the Israelis were unwilling to trade land for peace; another is that the Palestinians, preferring war to peace, were unwilling to accept any realistic deal offered to them. Whichever perspective is correct, the inchoate negotiations shuddered to a halt in 1995 when a religious Israeli extremist, angry at Rabin s peace moves, shot him dead in Tel Aviv. Chaos followed. Extremists on both sides, opposed to any peace deal that would involve some degree of compromise, took charge. Palestinian suicide bombers blew up Israelis on buses and in marketplaces. In 1996, a rightwing government led by Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in Israel, aiming to block the political changes made by Rabin. Critics argue that Netanyahu, who is in power again today, has worked assiduously to smash any political dialogue that would lead to Israel giving up land for a lasting political settlement, preferring instead stagnant talks and the offer of patchy autonomous areas of control to the Palestinians. Netanyahu s supporters see his policies as the natural result of Palestinian unwillingness to forge a compromise deal and accept Israel s right to exist. The continuing conundrum 1996 present The lack of political dialogue has led to further conflict. Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians after 1996, and the launch of a second intifada in 2000, led to Israel retaliating with the construction of a huge  separation  wall to stop suicide bombers and blockade the West Bank, while simultaneously building new settlements on land taken in 1967. A withdrawal of Israeli settlements from Gaza in 2005 came shortly before a split within the Palestinians between the Islamist Hamas movement based in Gaza and, on the West Bank, Palestine Liberation Organization-led secular political groups centred around the nationalist party Fatah. The internal divisions within the Palestinian camp that caused this split made it hard to present a unified front in any negotiations with Israel. This made a peace deal problematic because there were now two Palestinian camps   one of which, Hamas, had Israel s destruction explicitly written into its charter.

The relocation of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv angered Palestinians (MENAHEM KAHANA/Getty Images) Many Israelis were convinced that the Palestinians were not serious about peace. Israeli invasions of Lebanon provoked another conflict with Lebanon s Hezbollah (backed by Iran), which attacked Israel in 2006. In 2014, Israel launched large-scale attacks into Gaza in response to rocket fire from Hamas militants. The conflict rumbles on. Despite ongoing efforts to find a resolution, it still takes a determined optimist to see much future for a two-state solution in which the Israeli and Palestinian states coexist alongside each other. Similarly, a binational solution resulting in a single Israeli-Palestinian state as a home for all communities also seems unlikely.

        "target_summary": "For centuries before the dawn of the 20th, the land known as Palestine was an integral, yet segmented, part of the sprawling Ottoman Empire. It was a vibrant tapestry of cultures, predominantly inhabited by Arab communities—a mosaic of Sunni Muslims and a significant Christian minority—who, despite the absence of a formal nation-state, forged a distinct Palestinian identity. A sparse Jewish presence, integrated into urban life, constituted a mere 3% of the population in the early 1800s, living largely as merchants and teachers, not as cultivators of the land.\n\nThe late 19th century witnessed a transformative influx of European Jewish immigrants, fueled by the burgeoning Zionist movement and its aspiration for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Influenced by European nationalism, these new arrivals, dubbed \"settlers,\" purchased land and adopted names signifying strength, asserting an ancient claim to the region—a claim encapsulated by the poignant, though inaccurate, slogan: \"a land without a people for a people without a land.\" This vision, articulated by Theodor Herzl's \"The Jewish State\" in 1896 and solidified at the 1905 Zionist Congress, ignited fierce Palestinian resistance, manifesting in nationalistic newspapers like *Falastin* and aggressive actions against landowners who sold to Jewish settlers. The stage was set for an inevitable collision.\n\nThe First World War brought a new power to the fore: Britain. Their conquest of Palestine in 1917 was swiftly followed by the issuance of the Balfour Declaration, a delicately worded and strategically vague pledge expressing British favour for \"the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people,\" while also acknowledging the rights of the existing non-Jewish communities. This declaration, a boon to British wartime strategy, catalyzed Jewish settlement under British patronage, yet concurrently inflamed Palestinian resentment, leading to early riots and crystallizing a deep colonial divide. Some European Jewish settlers, imbued with a perceived superiority, harbored paternalistic views of the \"semi-savage\" local populace.\n\nAs the 1920s and 30s unfolded, violence escalated, forcing communities to take sides and shattering any faint hopes of coexistence. European Zionists, ideologically driven, clashed not only with Palestinians but also with the long-established Mizrahi Jews of the region. A nascent Jewish \"proto-state\" emerged, complete with defense organizations like Haganah, while Palestinian militant preachers mobilized their people for resistance. A major Arab revolt in 1936 was brutally suppressed by British forces, but the cycle of violence persisted. Britain's shifting wartime priorities, attempting to appease Arab allies by restricting Jewish immigration during the Holocaust, further alienated Zionists, who in turn launched terror attacks against their former British protectors, notably the King David Hotel bombing.\n\nIn 1947, a weary Britain decided to withdraw, leaving the United Nations to propose a partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international city. While Jewish representatives reluctantly accepted this path to international recognition, Palestinian and Arab leaders vehemently rejected it, decrying the proposed division as an unjust amputation of their homeland, ignoring the majority's right to self-determination.\n\nThe following year, with British forces departing, David Ben-Gurion declared the establishment of the State of Israel. This momentous declaration was immediately met by an invasion from neighboring Arab armies, intent on aiding their Palestinian brethren and pursuing their own regional ambitions. Against considerable odds, the newly forged Israeli forces triumphed, dramatically expanding their territory to encompass over 75% of former British Palestine. This victory, a triumph of independence for Israel, simultaneously became the \"Nakba\" or catastrophe for Palestinians, resulting in the profound uprooting and expulsion of some 700,000 people who became stateless refugees. This foundational conflict, marked by massacres on both sides, left an enduring legacy of deeply divergent narratives and unresolved grievances, with Israel now flanked by hostile neighbors.\n\nA series of brutal conflicts further reshaped the region. The 1956 Suez Crisis, the cataclysmic Six-Day War in 1967 (where Israel seized the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank, Golan Heights, and East Jerusalem, fueling a new wave of religious Zionism), and the 1973 Yom Kippur War cemented Israel's military dominance. Though a peace treaty was struck with Egypt in 1979, the core issue of Palestinian statelessness remained an open wound, even prompting Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon to confront Palestinian fighters.\n\nThe simmering frustrations of the Palestinian populace in the occupied territories finally erupted in 1987 with the First Intifada, a spontaneous uprising of stone-throwing youth against Israeli military might. The international outcry this generated compelled both sides to the negotiating table, leading to the historic Oslo Accords of 1993, a brief, tantalizing glimpse of \"land for peace.\" Yet, the fragile tendrils of peace were tragically severed in 1995 with the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a religious extremist. Extremist elements on both sides surged, with Palestinian suicide bombings met by the rise of hardline Israeli governments, epitomized by Benjamin Netanyahu, who critics argue deliberately stifled genuine political dialogue.\n\nThe enduring conundrum persists into the 21st century. The Second Intifada in 2000 spurred Israel's construction of a vast \"separation\" wall and the expansion of settlements, while a critical internal schism divided Palestinians between Hamas in Gaza (whose charter explicitly calls for Israel's destruction) and the Fatah-led secular groups in the West Bank. Ongoing cycles of conflict—such as the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and the 2014 Gaza conflict—underscore the profound lack of resolution. Today, the prospects for a two-state solution, or even a single binational state, appear agonizingly distant, leaving the region mired in an intractable, often violent, stalemate.",

These cards and card trimmer belonged to Harry Houdini, a lifelong collector of effects, props, and locking devices that he learned how to pick. Alamy/Cordon Press His desire for success grew stronger when his father fell sick. In 1883 Ehrich set up an improvised circus along with boys from his neighborhood and performed as a trapeze artist. In a glimpse of his future flair for self-styling, the nine-year-old crowned himself Prince of the Air. Having tried and failed to work as a rabbi, Ehrich s father moved the Weisses to a New York slum. The young boy s early love for illusionism and tricks offered the chance of freedom from the fate that awaited so many young immigrants at that time: the lifelong drudgery of the garment trade. As if in preparation for the feats ahead, the stocky Ehrich trained by lifting weights, swimming, and boxing while taking on a variety of manual-labor jobs to make ends meet. A friend introduced Ehrich to the memoirs of 19th-century French magician Jean-Eug ne Robert-Houdin, considered the father of modern conjuring. In the 1890s, Ehrich added an i to Houdin to make his new last name, and his career, \"like Houdin.\" He also gave himself a new first name in homage to American magician Harry Kellar. Under this stage name, Harry Houdini set up a traveling circus with his younger brother, whose stage name was Theodore  Dash  Hardeen. The brothers featured high-wire acts, snake charmers, and belly dancers. The duo reached their long-sought acclaim with what became their signature act, Metamorphosis, first performed at the 1893 Chicago World s Fair. Dash tied Houdini up and put him in a sack, which was placed inside a chest. Once the curtain was pulled, Dash was revealed to have replaced Houdini, the speed of which astonished the crowds. Unrestrained One of Houdini's most iconic stunts was his straitjacket escape. First performed in Kansas City in 1915 in front of thousands, and always staged near newspaper offices, it involved Houdini dangling from a crane by his feet. Wriggling himself free from the straitjacket, shown here, he then spread his arms wide to the frenzy of the crowd. Bridgeman/ACI Within a year, Dash was superseded by young singer and dancer Wilhelmina Beatrice Rahner, or Bess, who Houdini had married within three weeks of meeting and made his new partner in magic. They went by the Houdinis, and Bess became his stage assistant for the rest of his life. Although their performances, also consisting of traditional magic tricks, were popular, earnings were scant. Houdini knew he had to maximize the sensationalism to pull in the crowds. The handcuff king Experience as an apprentice locksmith gave Houdini the founding idea of his career.

In 1899 entrepreneur Martin Beck offered Houdini a contract to perform in his theaters. Houdini now had a substantial income, and new horizons suddenly opened. He was performing in Britain in 1900 and Russia in 1903. His popularity led to an avalanche of copycats and doubters, forcing him to push his limits and defend his name, even winning a lawsuit in 1902 against a German newspaper that called him a fraud. Starting in 1908, his signature act was being locked in a milk can full of water. In 1912 he replaced the milk can with the water torture cell, where he was bound in chains and padlocks and submerged upside down. Public fascination with his daredevilry won Houdini star roles in early cinema. The plot of the 1919 movie The Grim Game centers on an escapologist played by Houdini.

Biographers have wondered what drove Houdini to such extreme acts. Some suggest it was to resolve the trauma of being a poor outsider. A target of anti-Semitic insults, Houdini seemed to have aligned himself with the emerging idea of the muscular Jew to counter the prevalent stereotype that Jewish men were physically weak. (Harry Houdini s unlikely last act? Taking on the occult.) Houdini was fiercely critical of spiritualism, a hugely popular practice at the time. He regarded it as fraudulent. One reading of his career is as extreme rationalism in the face of death. Yet for a man always prepared to die, the nature of his demise took his admirers, and the country, by surprise. During the height of his career, in October 1926, Houdini was in Montr al to perform at McGill University. A student asked about his abdominal strength and whether he could withstand punches. When Houdini replied he could, the student punched him in the stomach. Houdini seemed to have been unprepared for the blow, which caused him a great deal of pain.

Inspired by French magician Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin and driven by a desire for freedom, the nine-year-old \"Prince of the Air\" rigorously trained his body, forging himself into an instrument capable of unfathomable feats. Adopting his iconic stage name in homage to his idols, Houdini first partnered with his brother, Theodore \"Dash\" Hardeen. Their signature \"Metamorphosis\" act, first performed at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, showcased Houdini's early mastery of rapid transformation, astonishing crowds with its dazzling speed.\n\nHoudini's ambition soared when he replaced his brother with his new wife, Bess, understanding that true success lay in sensationalism beyond traditional magic.

A fierce critic of fraudulent spiritualism, he died in October 1926 at just 52.

At the request of the Catholic Monarchs, Juan was sent to Spain to be invested as Duke of Gandi a and to seal the marriage arranged for him with Ferdinand II s cousin. Alexander prepared an even more splendid future for Juan on Italian soil. He showered him with titles, honors, territories, and wealth. And Juan, though he didn t always follow his father s advice, knew how to talk him round. But in 1497, when Juan returned to Rome, disaster struck. He was stabbed to death by unknown assassins and thrown into the Tiber River. Alexander s desolation was absolute:  If we had seven papacies, we would give them all to restore him to life,  he declared, weeping before the consistory. Who murdered the Duke of Gand a? A 16th-century portrait of a man believed to be Juan Borgia. Sergio Anelli/Mondadori/Album What befell the pope s son on a summer s night in 1497 is an enduring Renaissance murder mystery. Three years before, Juan Borgia s father sent him to Spain, where it was hoped Juan would use the influence of his wife, a cousin of King Ferdinand II s, to further Borgia fortunes in Spain and Aragon  controlled Naples. A pleasure -seeker, Juan returned to Rome at his father s request following the French invasion of Italy in 1496. He was appointed the Vatican s military commander to seize the rival Orsini s lands as punish ment for their siding with the French. In June 1497, at the age of 21, Juan disappeared. His body was later pulled from the Tiber River covered in stab wounds, but his purse was intact. This was no com mon robbery. Had the Orsinis done the deed? Or was this the revenge of his rumor -spreading brother- in- law Giovanni Sforza, whose mar riage to Juan s sister Lucrezia had just been annulled? As cardinal, Cesare from the beginning offered the pope firm support in affairs of both Church and state. An ambassador Gianandrea Boccaccio wrote of Cesare,  He is a man of great talent and of an excellent nature; his manners are those of the son of a great prince...  Perhaps his father saw in him the potential for a third Borgia pope. In any case, Alexander did not immediately give in to Cesare s repeated requests that he be allowed to abandon his own ecclesiastical career, for which Cesare claimed he felt no vocation. The pope only accepted Cesare s resignation as cardinal a year after Juan s death. Cesare recognized his father as a great master in the art of politics and the changing alliances that characterized the time. They had several shared objectives, but Cesare was aware that given his father s age and failing health, time was running out. As commander of the papal army, Cesare conquered cities in an attempt to carve out a Borgia state. Even his allies despised his growing power, and after his father s passing, Cesare struggled to maintain control without papal support. (He was a Founding Father. His son sided with the British.) Luxury apartments In the Room of the Saints, Pinturicchio paints this scene of court life, with a multitude of lavishly dressed figures, in the style of portraiture. Among those depicted is the architect Giuliano da Sangallo carrying a compass, in reference to the work he had undertaken for Pope Alexander VI at Rome s Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. At his side is Pinturicchio himself. A monumental triumphal arch, inspired by the Arch of Constantine in Rome, dominates the composition. It is topped by a statue of a bull, the heraldic symbol of Alexander VI. The inscription pacis cultori ( he who loves peace ) also refers to the pope. Below the arch, St. Catherine of Alexandria has a strong resemblance to the pope s daughter Lucrezia Borgia, who was in her mid- teens when the scene was painted. Finally, the model for the man wearing the white turban, to the far right, could be Djem, the brother and rival of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II. Djem had been a prisoner of the French and used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Ottomans, passing into the custody of Pope Alexander VI s predecessor, Pope Innocent VIII, in 1489. Alexander agreed to hold Djem hostage if the Ottomans left Europe. Djem became a friend of Cesare Borgia. Oronoz/Album The Borgia Apartment at the Vatican was created during the papacy of Alexander VI (r. 1492 1503). Its rooms were painted by Pinturicchio ( The little painter ), ne  Bernardino di Betto. The Room of the Sibyls and the Room of the Creed are in the Borgia Tower. Adjoining these are the Room of Liberal Arts; the Room of Mysteries, depicting Pope Alexander VI kneeling at the feet of the resurrected Christ; and the Room of the Saints, shown here. Likely used as the pope s private study, the room is dedicated to seven saints, with numerous visual references to Pope Alexander VI and the Borgias. The scene here depicts the Disputation of St. Catherine of Alex andria. Refusing to make sacrifices to pagan gods, Catherine, a young Christian woman (center), defeats 50 scholars in a religious dispute. Although the governor of Egypt (enthroned), is impressed by her reasoning, he nevertheless orders Cath erine to be put to death. Several figures in the painting are likenesses of people from Alexander VI s circle, including some of his own children. Lucrezia, the most favored Among all his children, the pope most favored Lucrezia, the jewel of the family, for her beauty, sweet nature, and refinement. There was a strong bond of affection between father and daughter. Lucrezia s first husband was Giovanni Sforza, a relative of the Duke of Milan. That marriage failed on not only a personal level but also a political one. The marriage ended in annulment, and for Lucrezia there was a bitter epilogue. Sforza insinuated that she had engaged in an incestuous relationship with her father. Rumors spread to implicate her brothers too. Although the claim was refuted time and again, it still lingered. The black legend of the Borgias Milan s Castello Sforzesco was the residence of the Sforza dukes of Milan. Lucrezia Borgia s first husband, Giovanni Sforza, was from a parallel line of the Sforza family. Buena Vista Images/Getty Images The great Italian families were accustomed to holding the papacy and railed against the  intru sion  of the Borgias, whom they saw as outsiders. Two years after Rodrigo s accession to the papacy, France and Spain invaded Italy. Blaming the native of Valencia, Spain, for this aggression was a way for the pope s rivals to undermine his authority. Many accusations were pure invention, including the claim that he used poison to gain the papacy. The Borgias could certainly be ruthless in their quest for power, but this ferocity was normal for the Renaissance and exaggerated by their enemies. The most scandal ous defamation incest between daughter Lucrezia and her father or her brothers was propagated by Lucrezia s first husband, Giovanni Sforza, following the pope s annulment of their marriage. The arrival of a mystery baby at the Borgia household fueled the rumors. The child s parentage was veiled in secrecy. Legitimized as the son of Cesare and then, in a secret bull, as the offspring of the pope himself, the child could have been a natural son of Lucrezia s. Perhaps the family wanted to protect her by integrating the child with the Borgia surname. Despite their familial affection, Lucrezia soon discovered that her father had as much capacity to hurt her as he had to love her, and it would be impossible to find peace so long as he could interfere in her life. So, after the murder of her second husband, Alfonso of Aragon, she married for a third time, to Alfonso d Este, heir to the duchies of Ferrara, Modena, and Reggio. This allowed her to move far from Rome. Aware of her reasons for leaving, and of the union s convenience for the entire family, her father accepted the separation. Of the pope s regard for his daughter, the Duke of Ferrara s secretary remarked,  His Holiness loves her more than any other person of his blood.  (While Napoleon conquered nations, his sister conquered hearts.) Husband and wife Around 1510, Bartolomeo Veneto painted this portrait of Beatrice d Este, a pious 13th  century ancestor of Alfonso d Este, Duke of Ferrara, who was Lucrezia s third husband, shown in the second portrait. Art historians still debate whether Veneto used the likeness of Lucrezia for this and at least one other of his portraits. Snite Museum of Art, University of Notre Dame (Top) (Left) and DEA/Album (Bottom) (Right) Sibling rivalries Wherever the Borgia-Cattanei met, laughter, gallantry, wit, and music abounded. But it wasn t all smooth sailing. Some of the natural squabbles among siblings hardened into bitterness. Lucrezia was, in a way, the one who held them together. Goffredo was particularly close to Lucrezia: They went everywhere together, and she was protective of him. They grew even closer when Lucrezia married Alfonso of Aragon, the brother of Goffredo s wife, Sancha. Lucrezia and Sancha were great friends and neither the failure of Sancha and Goffredo s marriage nor the death of Alfonso broke the bond of friendship between the two sisters-in-law. It was Goffredo who protected Lucrezia and Alfonso s two-year-old son, Rodrigo, during the violent acts unleashed in Rome after the death of the pope. Little Rodrigo s father, Alfonso of Aragon, was already dead by this point. As Duchess of Ferrara, Lucrezia Borgia gave a lock of her hair to the humanist and cardinal Pietro Bembo, with whom she kept a close friendship. Marco Ansaloni But the brother for whom Lucrezia had the most affinity was Juan. Between Juan and Cesare, however, the relationship was strained. Alexander had maneuvered for Juan to receive all sorts of titles and territories, believing that this was in the best interest of the wider family. Meanwhile, Cesare, despite outshining his brother intellectually, had been forced to follow an ecclesiastical path that he hated. Perhaps Cesare considered himself more qualified than his brother to become a great prince. That perception was emphasized when Juan returned to Rome and demonstrated mediocre skills on the battlefield. Though Cesare lacked Juan s titles, his influence in the political and ecclesiastical realms went beyond that of the duke s power. In fact, as the pope s cardinal legate, Cesare was preparing to crown the new king of Naples, Frederick II. It was a level of authority that was difficult to surpass. Malicious rumors circulated that both Cesare and Juan were vying for their sister-in-law, Sancha of Aragon. It is impossible to know whether or not there was any truth to the gossip. Juan did have a reputation for being a womanizer, but the story could also have been an invention of the so-called black legend. The later accusations that Cesare murdered Juan because of sexual jealousy over Sancha are also hard to prove. Such gossip, however, worked to obscure an obvious political motive for the crime. Juan had achieved enormous power on Italian soil, and his death dealt a severe blow to the power of the House the Borgia in Italy and the kingdom of Valencia. Juan s heir was not yet three years old, showing the vulnerability of the pontiff.",
        "target_summary": "The formidable Borgia family, led by Pope Alexander VI, epitomized the ambition and dark intrigue of Renaissance Italy. Alexander's favorite son, Juan, Duke of Gandia, was initially destined for a brilliant political and military career. Adored by his father and showered with titles, wealth, and influence, Juan was sent to Spain for an advantageous marriage and later returned to Rome as the Vatican's military commander, tasked with consolidating Borgia power. However, his meteoric rise was cut tragically short in 1497 when he was mysteriously stabbed and his body dumped into the Tiber River. This brutal act plunged Alexander into inconsolable grief and became an enduring Renaissance murder mystery. Speculation abounded, pointing fingers at rival families like the Orsinis, or perhaps even Juan’s vengeful former brother-in-law, Giovanni Sforza. Some whispered of a more insidious culprit: Juan’s own intellectually superior and deeply ambitious brother, Cesare.\n\nCesare Borgia, a man of exceptional talent, initially resented his forced ecclesiastical career. Yet, after Juan’s death, Alexander finally allowed him to abandon his cardinalate. Free from the Church, Cesare became the formidable commander of the papal army, relentlessly pursuing the expansion of a Borgia state through conquest and shrewd political maneuvering. He recognized his father’s mastery of politics and, despite their shared objectives, felt the urgency of consolidating power given Alexander’s advanced age. His ascent underscored the strained relationship he shared with Juan, whom he likely viewed as less capable and undeserving of the vast secular power bestowed upon him by their father. The rumors of Juan's murder, fueled by sibling jealousy over power or even a shared paramour, Sancha of Aragon, obscured the more potent political motive: the removal of a rival who hindered Cesare's own path to supreme secular authority. Juan's death indeed dealt a severe blow to the Borgia family's immediate power in Italy, highlighting the vulnerability of the aging pontiff.\n\nAdding to the family's complex tapestry was Lucrezia Borgia, Alexander’s most cherished daughter, celebrated for her beauty, sweet nature, and refinement. She was a pivotal figure in the Borgias' dynastic ambitions, her multiple marriages serving as political instruments. Yet, Lucrezia’s life was marred by scandalous accusations, most notoriously by her first husband, Giovanni Sforza, who, after their annulment, spread damaging rumors of incest with her father and brothers. These vile slanders, coupled with the mysterious parentage of a child legitimized first as Cesare’s and then Alexander’s, contributed significantly to the infamous \"black legend\" surrounding the Borgias. Despite the deep affection between father and daughter, Lucrezia eventually sought refuge from Rome and her father's pervasive influence, marrying Alfonso d’Este and moving to Ferrara to find peace.\n\nThe Borgias’ opulent lifestyle and projection of power were vividly expressed in the Vatican’s Borgia Apartment, sumptuously frescoed by Pinturicchio. These rooms, like the Room of the Saints, subtly incorporated likenesses of family members – Lucrezia depicted as St. Catherine, for instance – amidst grand religious and courtly scenes, effectively transforming sacred spaces into celebrations of Borgia grandeur. The \"black legend\" itself was largely a creation of their Italian rivals, who resented the \"intrusion\" of this Spanish family into the papacy and sought to undermine their authority through exaggerated accusations of poison, depravity, and incest. While the Borgias were indeed ruthless in their pursuit of power, a common trait in the volatile Renaissance, their enemies magnified their actions into a saga of unparalleled villainy, ensuring their enduring, dark reputation.",

For three young women in the early 1300s, being the daughters-in-law of a king could be just as burdensome, especially when the sovereign was the ruthless Philip IV of France. Like many kings before him, Philip IV was focused on the question of his succession. His dynasty, the Capets, had ruled France since the 900s, and to ensure its survival, Philip made strategic marriages for his children to secure alliances and heirs. His three sons married French noblewomen, and his daughter, Isabella, wed King Edward II of England. But all his plans would come undone in 1314, when his children and their spouses were engulfed by the Nesle Tower affair. The scandal not only led to torture, imprisonment, and the possible murder of one of the princesses; it also led to a succession crisis in France that sparked the ruinous Hundred Years  War.

Anxious to secure the Capetian dynasty, Philip IV (at center in a 14th-century miniature) married his sons to Burgundian noblewomen. Oronoz/Album Only one of these marriages is recorded as being happy. Even by the standards of dynastic marriage, Margaret s union with Louis was cold. Charles was overbearing with Blanche. Only Joan appeared to have been happily married to Philip, a bond that would later spare her from the miserable fates of her sisters-in-law. The scandal began in 1313 when Isabella, King Philip s daughter, visited Paris with her infant son, the future Edward III of England. Several chronicles describe a puppet show at which Isabella gave embroidered silk purses to her three sisters-in-law, Margaret, Blanche, and Joan. (Twists of fate made Nagasaki a target 75 years ago) On a later visit home, Isabella noticed that two knights accompanying her sisters-in-law brothers Philippe and Gautier d Aunay were wearing those gifted purses on their belts. It is said Isabella saw these purses as a sign of an illicit liaison between the knights and her sisters-in-law, and she alerted her father in 1314. On their own, the purses were unlikely to have been enough proof of adultery.

Now in the Capitoline Museums, it was restored in the 17th century. Alamy/ACI By the age of 20, Nero had already forged his own political style and instituted judicial and fiscal reforms benefiting the common people (plebeians). But his political vision was hampered by his mother Agrippina, who, after getting rid of all her rivals, threatened to remove her son from power. The first time that Agrippina was accused of plotting a coup d e tat against her son, in A.D. 55, Nero showed clemency. Agrippina had allied herself with Nero s rival Rubellius Plautus (the great-grandson of Emperor Tiberius). Nero forgave his mother and her accomplice, and he exiled others involved in the plot. However, when Agrippina again took action against her son three years later, one of Nero s advisers encouraged him to have her killed while making it look like an accident at sea. According to Tacitus, it was the freedman Anicetus who dreamed up the boat plot, but senator and historian Cassius Dio wrote that Seneca and Nero came up with the idea together. Either way, Nero gave orders to scupper the ship his mother was sailing on off the coast of Naples. Miraculously, Agrippina survived the shipwreck. Then, on March 23, A.D. 59, she was finally assassinated by Nero s henchmen at her villa in Bauli. It s said that a well-known comic actor made a daring allusion in song to the murder. He sang:  Farewell to thee, father; farewell to thee, mother,  while doing a mime of eating and swimming. Claudius had been poisoned while eating dinner, and Agrippina had narrowly escaped being drowned. The likeness of Nero s wife Octavia appears on a coin minted around A.D. 56 57. Nero banished Octavia to the remote Mediterranean island of Pandataria, where he had her killed. Bridgeman/ACI Despite these lurid events, which overshadowed Nero s reign and detracted from his general policy of clemency, Nero retained considerable popularity by providing the people with bread and circuses. But the support of the common people began to wane when Poppaea Sabina, a beautiful Pompeian woman, appeared on the scene. In A.D. 62, when Poppaea became pregnant several months into an adulterous relationship with Nero, the emperor decided to divorce his wife Octavia and marry Poppaea. To justify these actions, Nero accused Octavia of adultery with an enslaved person and exiled her to Campania, on the southwest coast. Outraged, the people began to destroy the public images of Poppaea in solidarity with the exiled empress. The revolt forced Nero to bring Octavia back to Rome, but he was now determined to sentence her to death. After facing a second false accusation of adultery, this time with Nero s former accomplice Anicetus, the commander of the Misenum fleet, Octavia was sent to the island of Pandataria. There, some of the emperor s assassins murdered her by slashing her veins and immersing her in boiling water. A 16th-century painting of Poppaea Sabina, second wife of Nero.

In fact, there was more Pompeian graffiti in favor of Nero than for any previous emperor, and the messages remained visible even after Nero had been sentenced to damnatio memoriae, the removal of all his public and private images and inscriptions after his death. Nero s special popularity in Pompeii can be explained not only by Poppaea s Pompeian origin but also by the favors that Nero granted the city. He contributed to Pompeii s recovery after an earthquake devastated it in A.D. 62, and he visited in person to make offerings at the temple of Venus. Nero also gained popularity by allowing Pompeians to return to their amphitheater early. Octavia's gruesome murder One of the episodes that most damaged Nero s reputation was the murder of his first wife, Claudia Octavia. DEA/Album According to the account by Tacitus in the second century, Poppaea Sabina, Nero s lover, drove the murder of his wife Octavia, convincing Nero that divorcing his wife to marry her would not be enough. As the daughter of Emperor Claudius, Octavia was popular with the masses, which made her a threat to both Nero and his new wife. Octavia, therefore, also needed to be discredited and eliminated. To achieve this, Nero falsely accused Octavia of committing adultery with the prefect Anicetus, whom he persuaded to  confess  to the affair. She was also accused of aborting a child she had conceived with Anicetus, a practice that was not illegal but was disapproved of. As punishment, Tacitus writes, Nero confined her to the island of Pandataria (modern day Ventotene), off the west coast of Italy: No exile ever filled the eyes of beholders with tears of greater compassion . . . After a few days, she received an order that she was to die . . . She was then tightly bound with cords, and the veins of every limb were opened; but as her blood was congealed by terror and flowed too slowly, she was killed outright by the steam of an intensely hot bath. To this was added the yet more appalling horror of Poppaea beholding the severed head which was conveyed to Rome. The oil painting  Revenge of Poppea  by the 19th  century Italian artist Giovanni Muzzioli depicts the moment that Poppaea gloats over the severed head of Octavia, presented to her on a plat er. Nero s new wife reclines on a couch, leaning against the emperor, who appears markedly indifferent to the gruesome sight of his ex wife s disembodied head. By contrast, two senators to his right are visibly shocked. The clothing, furniture, and art that decorate the walls in this painting were carefully designed by the artist to depict Rome in the A.D. 60s It is now displayed in the Civic Museum of Modena, Italy. Their games had been banned for 10 years, as punishment for a brawl that had broken out in the crowd at a gladiatorial contest when locals clashed violently with spectators from neighboring Nuceria. To cement the loyalty of the Pompeians, Nero reopened it after just five years. In this contemporary photo, the volcano of Vesuvius looms beyond a street in the ancient city of Pompeii. Inscriptions celebrating Nero and his wife Poppaea Sabina were found on walls at the site. Vittorio Sciosia/Fototeca 9x12 Not unique The violence of Nero s reign, as depicted by the ancient biographers, intensified in the A.D. 60s. Ongoing conflict between the Senate and the emperor fueled conspiracies, and Nero ramped up surveillance. Ofonius Tigellinus, prefect of the Praetorian Guard in A.D. 62, led an effective team of spies, who rooted out alleged conspirators. Accused of defaming Nero, the most dangerous rivals of the emperor met untimely deaths: Rubellius Plautus, Faustus Cornelius Sulla, Gaius Calpurnius Piso, Seneca, and many of their co-conspirators.",
        "target_summary": "This marble bust of Emperor Nero, carved around A.D. 60, captures the ruler in his early twenties, a period when he still commanded significant public favor. His early reign was marked by progressive judicial and fiscal reforms, thoughtfully designed to benefit the common people and solidify his popularity through initiatives often described as \"bread and circuses.\"\n\nHowever, Nero's political path was immediately complicated by his formidable mother, Agrippina, whose own ambitions frequently clashed with his authority. After an initial accusation of plotting a coup in A.D. 55, Nero displayed clemency, only for Agrippina to resume her machinations three years later. This time, urged by his advisers, Nero orchestrated a perilous attempt on her life, commissioning a rigged ship designed to capsize off the coast of Naples. Miraculously, Agrippina survived the shipwreck, only to be brutally assassinated by Nero's henchmen at her Bauli villa in A.D. 59, an infamous event later alluded to by a daring comic actor.\n\nNero's personal life further descended into ruthless ambition with the arrival of the beautiful Poppaea Sabina. In A.D. 62, Poppaea's pregnancy prompted Nero to divorce his popular first wife, Octavia, daughter of Claudius, and swiftly marry Poppaea. Octavia faced a false accusation of adultery and was exiled, sparking public outrage in Rome, where citizens defiantly destroyed images of Poppaea. Though initially forced to recall Octavia, Nero, now determined to eliminate her, leveled a second fabricated adultery charge, leading to her banishment to the remote island of Pandataria. There, she met a horrifying end: her veins were severed, and she was immersed in a boiling bath, her severed head later presented to a gloating Poppaea. While Rome largely scorned Poppaea, she and Nero enjoyed surprising popularity in her native Pompeii, where abundant pro-imperial graffiti remained visible even after Nero's *damnatio memoriae*, a testament to his city-favoring policies following a devastating earthquake.\n\nAs the A.D. 60s progressed, the dark undercurrents of Nero's reign intensified. Fueled by ongoing conflicts with the Senate and a growing paranoia, his government employed extensive surveillance led by figures like Praetorian Prefect Ofonius Tigellinus. Numerous perceived rivals and alleged conspirators, including prominent figures like Seneca, met untimely and often violent deaths, solidifying a legacy marked by both public favor and chilling brutality.",

        "content": "Right up until the end, Caligula made rational decisions,  says Barrett, comparing him more to a Joseph Stalin as opposed to a deranged Hitler figure.  He could distinguish reality from fantasy.  But the monarch s reality was one suffused in total power a privilege he wielded strategically and at will. That power would have gone to anyone s head.  When he entered the city, full and absolute power was at once put into his hands by the unanimous consent of the senate and the mob,  claimed Suetonius, a historian known for his biographies of the Caesars. From the first, though, Caligula s imperial might was bathed in blood of thousands of animal sacrifices.  So great was the public rejoicing,  said Suetonius,  that within the next three months more than a hundred and sixty thousand victims are said to have been slain in sacrifice.  Trustworthy sources? Despite those excesses, says Barrett, it s important to question the accounts of Caligula s contemporaries. Their work was informed by his political enemies and distorted by hearsay. The most trustworthy chronicler of his day, Tacitus, did write about Caligula, but unfortunately his work has been lost. The histories that remained contain  ridiculous and absurd  accounts of the emperor, says Barrett, who compares Suetonius and his contemporary, Cassius Dio, to tabloid reporters in search of a scoop on the embattled emperor. Caligula s behavior was definitely cruel but likely a little less juicy than Dio and Suetonius would have you believe. Take Caligula s widely reported demands to be treated like a god. That would have been standard practice in Roman colonies, which were forced to recognize the so-called  imperial cult  of Rome. But Barrett says there is no evidence like coinage that would support a similar demand within Rome or even Italy. Then there s the infamous tale of making his horse a consul a threat that never came to fruition. Barrett attributes that episode to an annoyed emperor mocking his enemies in the senate enemies he considered so incompetent and feckless, they could easily be replaced by an animal. Besides a stall of marble, a manger of ivory, purple blankets and a collar of precious stones, [Caligula] even gave this horse [Incitatus] a house, a troop of slaves and furniture ... and it is also said that he planned to make him consul. Suetonius , Lives of the Caesars Bad reputation? But even if Caligula never engaged in the most outrageous exploits attributed to him, the fact of his outsized and extremely long-lasting reputation remains. What accounts for the ongoing notoriety of a man whose rule lasted less than four years nearly two millennia ago?  Humans love villains,  says Barrett, and Caligula enjoys ongoing fame thanks to a combination of personal charisma and stubborn enmity among his contemporaries. There s another factor, says Barrett: The passage of time. Because so many years have passed since his exploits, Barrett says,  Caligula belongs to a world that is so alien to us now that we can enjoy his villainy with a clear conscience.",
        "target_summary": "Challenging the long-held image of Emperor Caligula as a deranged tyrant, historian Barrett posits a more calculating figure, likening him to a Joseph Stalin rather than an insane Hitler. Caligula, he argues, could discern reality from fantasy, yet operated within a unique reality shaped by absolute power—a privilege universally granted to him by the Roman Senate and populace. While early reign saw vast animal sacrifices marking public jubilation, Barrett urges caution regarding contemporary historical accounts. These often-sensational narratives, penned by political adversaries like Suetonius and Cassius Dio (whom Barrett compares to \"tabloid reporters\"), are riddled with hearsay and distortions, lamenting the loss of more reliable chroniclers like Tacitus.\n\nBarrett contends that many of Caligula's most outlandish acts are likely exaggerated. He finds no definitive evidence, such as coinage, to support claims of the emperor demanding deification within Rome itself, though the \"imperial cult\" was standard in colonies. Similarly, the infamous tale of appointing his horse, Incitatus, as consul is reinterpreted not as madness, but as a scathing mockery of senators Caligula deemed utterly incompetent—a threat never materialized. While acknowledging Caligula's definite cruelty, Barrett suggests his behavior was less \"juicy\" than sensationalized histories portray.\n\nNevertheless, Caligula's colossal and enduring reputation as a villain persists. This notoriety, according to Barrett, stems from a potent blend of human fascination with evil figures, the emperor's own charismatic personality, the stubborn enmity of his contemporaries, and perhaps most significantly, the vast chasm of time. This temporal distance allows modern audiences to revel in his perceived villainy with a clear conscience, seeing him as a relic of an utterly alien past.",

Charismatic, clever, and aggressive, Jugurtha represented a threat to Micipsa s throne and his two sons. Assisting Rome in Spain would conveniently put Jugurtha in harm s way. Perhaps he would never return. Numidian coin bearing the image of Jugurtha. National Library, Paris AKG/ALBUM But Jugurtha did return after a decisive Roman victory at Numantia with a glowing letter of recommendation from Scipio. His military and political reputation enhanced, Jugurtha had also established valuable Roman connections. To diminish his threat to the throne, King Micipsa decided to adopt his nephew and include him in a three-way split of the kingdom with his biological sons, Hiempsal and Adherbal. Jugurtha s ambition was undeniable, and he would not be content to co-rule with his adoptive brothers. Most of what is known about Jugurtha s life comes from two Roman historians: Sallust and Plutarch, who recorded how he employed bribery, treachery, and murder in ruthless pursuit of sole control of Numidia. The civil conflict, the Jugurthine War, would turn into a costly distraction for Rome that exposed the corruption eating away at the heart of the Roman Republic. Numidian Kings Numidian light cavalry, Trajan's Column (19th-century replica) WHITE IMAGES/SCALA, FLORENCE The kingdom that Jugurtha strove to rule alone arose during the Second Punic War fought between Rome and Carthage in the third century B.C. Allying himself with Rome, Jugurtha s grandfather, King Masinissa, united the region under his rule as the kingdom of Numidia. His land prospered, and following Rome s destruction of Carthage in 146 B.C., Masinissa s son, Micipsa, continued ruling as a Roman ally. His division of the kingdom into three provoked the Jugurthine War. The kingdom made the wrong call during the Roman civil wars in the first century B.C. when King Juba I sided against Julius Caesar.

For three young women in the early 1300s, being the daughters-in-law of a king could be just as burdensome, especially when the sovereign was the ruthless Philip IV of France. Like many kings before him, Philip IV was focused on the question of his succession. His dynasty, the Capets, had ruled France since the 900s, and to ensure its survival, Philip made strategic marriages for his children to secure alliances and heirs. His three sons married French noblewomen, and his daughter, Isabella, wed King Edward II of England. But all his plans would come undone in 1314, when his children and their spouses were engulfed by the Nesle Tower affair. The scandal not only led to torture, imprisonment, and the possible murder of one of the princesses; it also led to a succession crisis in France that sparked the ruinous Hundred Years  War. (How Joan of Arc turned the tide in the Hundred Years  War.) Illicit affairs The wives of all three of King Philip s adult sons hailed from the neighboring region of Burgundy. Louis (the future Louis X) married Margaret, daughter of the Duke of Burgundy. Philip (the future Philip V) married Joan, daughter of the Count of Burgundy. Finally, Charles, (the future Charles IV) married Joan s sister, Blanche of Burgundy. Anxious to secure the Capetian dynasty, Philip IV (at center in a 14th-century miniature) married his sons to Burgundian noblewomen. Oronoz/Album Only one of these marriages is recorded as being happy. Even by the standards of dynastic marriage, Margaret s union with Louis was cold. Charles was overbearing with Blanche. Only Joan appeared to have been happily married to Philip, a bond that would later spare her from the miserable fates of her sisters-in-law. The scandal began in 1313 when Isabella, King Philip s daughter, visited Paris with her infant son, the future Edward III of England. Several chronicles describe a puppet show at which Isabella gave embroidered silk purses to her three sisters-in-law, Margaret, Blanche, and Joan. (Twists of fate made Nagasaki a target 75 years ago) On a later visit home, Isabella noticed that two knights accompanying her sisters-in-law brothers Philippe and Gautier d Aunay were wearing those gifted purses on their belts. It is said Isabella saw these purses as a sign of an illicit liaison between the knights and her sisters-in-law, and she alerted her father in 1314. On their own, the purses were unlikely to have been enough proof of adultery.

Alexander prepared an even more splendid future for Juan on Italian soil. He showered him with titles, honors, territories, and wealth. And Juan, though he didn t always follow his father s advice, knew how to talk him round. But in 1497, when Juan returned to Rome, disaster struck. He was stabbed to death by unknown assassins and thrown into the Tiber River. Alexander s desolation was absolute:  If we had seven papacies, we would give them all to restore him to life,  he declared, weeping before the consistory. Who murdered the Duke of Gand a? A 16th-century portrait of a man believed to be Juan Borgia. Sergio Anelli/Mondadori/Album What befell the pope s son on a summer s night in 1497 is an enduring Renaissance murder mystery. Three years before, Juan Borgia s father sent him to Spain, where it was hoped Juan would use the influence of his wife, a cousin of King Ferdinand II s, to further Borgia fortunes in Spain and Aragon  controlled Naples. A pleasure -seeker, Juan returned to Rome at his father s request following the French invasion of Italy in 1496. He was appointed the Vatican s military commander to seize the rival Orsini s lands as punish ment for their siding with the French. In June 1497, at the age of 21, Juan disappeared. His body was later pulled from the Tiber River covered in stab wounds, but his purse was intact. This was no com mon robbery. Had the Orsinis done the deed? Or was this the revenge of his rumor -spreading brother- in- law Giovanni Sforza, whose mar riage to Juan s sister Lucrezia had just been annulled? As cardinal, Cesare from the beginning offered the pope firm support in affairs of both Church and state. An ambassador Gianandrea Boccaccio wrote of Cesare,  He is a man of great talent and of an excellent nature; his manners are those of the son of a great prince...  Perhaps his father saw in him the potential for a third Borgia pope. In any case, Alexander did not immediately give in to Cesare s repeated requests that he be allowed to abandon his own ecclesiastical career, for which Cesare claimed he felt no vocation. The pope only accepted Cesare s resignation as cardinal a year after Juan s death. Cesare recognized his father as a great master in the art of politics and the changing alliances that characterized the time. They had several shared objectives, but Cesare was aware that given his father s age and failing health, time was running out. As commander of the papal army, Cesare conquered cities in an attempt to carve out a Borgia state. Even his allies despised his growing power, and after his father s passing, Cesare struggled to maintain control without papal support. (He was a Founding Father. His son sided with the British.) Luxury apartments In the Room of the Saints, Pinturicchio paints this scene of court life, with a multitude of lavishly dressed figures, in the style of portraiture. Among those depicted is the architect Giuliano da Sangallo carrying a compass, in reference to the work he had undertaken for Pope Alexander VI at Rome s Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. At his side is Pinturicchio himself. A monumental triumphal arch, inspired by the Arch of Constantine in Rome, dominates the composition. It is topped by a statue of a bull, the heraldic symbol of Alexander VI. The inscription pacis cultori ( he who loves peace ) also refers to the pope. Below the arch, St. Catherine of Alexandria has a strong resemblance to the pope s daughter Lucrezia Borgia, who was in her mid- teens when the scene was painted. Finally, the model for the man wearing the white turban, to the far right, could be Djem, the brother and rival of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II. Djem had been a prisoner of the French and used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Ottomans, passing into the custody of Pope Alexander VI s predecessor, Pope Innocent VIII, in 1489. Alexander agreed to hold Djem hostage if the Ottomans left Europe. Djem became a friend of Cesare Borgia. Oronoz/Album The Borgia Apartment at the Vatican was created during the papacy of Alexander VI (r. 1492 1503). Its rooms were painted by Pinturicchio ( The little painter ), ne  Bernardino di Betto. The Room of the Sibyls and the Room of the Creed are in the Borgia Tower. Adjoining these are the Room of Liberal Arts; the Room of Mysteries, depicting Pope Alexander VI kneeling at the feet of the resurrected Christ; and the Room of the Saints, shown here. Likely used as the pope s private study, the room is dedicated to seven saints, with numerous visual references to Pope Alexander VI and the Borgias. The scene here depicts the Disputation of St. Catherine of Alex andria. Refusing to make sacrifices to pagan gods, Catherine, a young Christian woman (center), defeats 50 scholars in a religious dispute. Although the governor of Egypt (enthroned), is impressed by her reasoning, he nevertheless orders Cath erine to be put to death. Several figures in the painting are likenesses of people from Alexander VI s circle, including some of his own children. Lucrezia, the most favored Among all his children, the pope most favored Lucrezia, the jewel of the family, for her beauty, sweet nature, and refinement. There was a strong bond of affection between father and daughter. Lucrezia s first husband was Giovanni Sforza, a relative of the Duke of Milan. That marriage failed on not only a personal level but also a political one. The marriage ended in annulment, and for Lucrezia there was a bitter epilogue. Sforza insinuated that she had engaged in an incestuous relationship with her father. Rumors spread to implicate her brothers too. Although the claim was refuted time and again, it still lingered. The black legend of the Borgias Milan s Castello Sforzesco was the residence of the Sforza dukes of Milan. Lucrezia Borgia s first husband, Giovanni Sforza, was from a parallel line of the Sforza family. Buena Vista Images/Getty Images The great Italian families were accustomed to holding the papacy and railed against the  intru sion  of the Borgias, whom they saw as outsiders. Two years after Rodrigo s accession to the papacy, France and Spain invaded Italy. Blaming the native of Valencia, Spain, for this aggression was a way for the pope s rivals to undermine his authority. Many accusations were pure invention, including the claim that he used poison to gain the papacy. The Borgias could certainly be ruthless in their quest for power, but this ferocity was normal for the Renaissance and exaggerated by their enemies. The most scandal ous defamation incest between daughter Lucrezia and her father or her brothers was propagated by Lucrezia s first husband, Giovanni Sforza, following the pope s annulment of their marriage. The arrival of a mystery baby at the Borgia household fueled the rumors. The child s parentage was veiled in secrecy. Legitimized as the son of Cesare and then, in a secret bull, as the offspring of the pope himself, the child could have been a natural son of Lucrezia s. Perhaps the family wanted to protect her by integrating the child with the Borgia surname. Despite their familial affection, Lucrezia soon discovered that her father had as much capacity to hurt her as he had to love her, and it would be impossible to find peace so long as he could interfere in her life. So, after the murder of her second husband, Alfonso of Aragon, she married for a third time, to Alfonso d Este, heir to the duchies of Ferrara, Modena, and Reggio. This allowed her to move far from Rome. Aware of her reasons for leaving, and of the union s convenience for the entire family, her father accepted the separation. Of the pope s regard for his daughter, the Duke of Ferrara s secretary remarked,  His Holiness loves her more than any other person of his blood.  (While Napoleon conquered nations, his sister conquered hearts.) Husband and wife Around 1510, Bartolomeo Veneto painted this portrait of Beatrice d Este, a pious 13th  century ancestor of Alfonso d Este, Duke of Ferrara, who was Lucrezia s third husband, shown in the second portrait. Art historians still debate whether Veneto used the likeness of Lucrezia for this and at least one other of his portraits. Snite Museum of Art, University of Notre Dame (Top) (Left) and DEA/Album (Bottom) (Right) Sibling rivalries Wherever the Borgia-Cattanei met, laughter, gallantry, wit, and music abounded. But it wasn t all smooth sailing. Some of the natural squabbles among siblings hardened into bitterness. Lucrezia was, in a way, the one who held them together. Goffredo was particularly close to Lucrezia: They went everywhere together, and she was protective of him. They grew even closer when Lucrezia married Alfonso of Aragon, the brother of Goffredo s wife, Sancha. Lucrezia and Sancha were great friends and neither the failure of Sancha and Goffredo s marriage nor the death of Alfonso broke the bond of friendship between the two sisters-in-law. It was Goffredo who protected Lucrezia and Alfonso s two-year-old son, Rodrigo, during the violent acts unleashed in Rome after the death of the pope. Little Rodrigo s father, Alfonso of Aragon, was already dead by this point. As Duchess of Ferrara, Lucrezia Borgia gave a lock of her hair to the humanist and cardinal Pietro Bembo, with whom she kept a close friendship. Marco Ansaloni But the brother for whom Lucrezia had the most affinity was Juan. Between Juan and Cesare, however, the relationship was strained. Alexander had maneuvered for Juan to receive all sorts of titles and territories, believing that this was in the best interest of the wider family. Meanwhile, Cesare, despite outshining his brother intellectually, had been forced to follow an ecclesiastical path that he hated. Perhaps Cesare considered himself more qualified than his brother to become a great prince. That perception was emphasized when Juan returned to Rome and demonstrated mediocre skills on the battlefield. Though Cesare lacked Juan s titles, his influence in the political and ecclesiastical realms went beyond that of the duke s power. In fact, as the pope s cardinal legate, Cesare was preparing to crown the new king of Naples, Frederick II. It was a level of authority that was difficult to surpass. Malicious rumors circulated that both Cesare and Juan were vying for their sister-in-law, Sancha of Aragon. It is impossible to know whether or not there was any truth to the gossip. Juan did have a reputation for being a womanizer, but the story could also have been an invention of the so-called black legend. The later accusations that Cesare murdered Juan because of sexual jealousy over Sancha are also hard to prove. Such gossip, however, worked to obscure an obvious political motive for the crime. Juan had achieved enormous power on Italian soil, and his death dealt a severe blow to the power of the House the Borgia in Italy and the kingdom of Valencia. Juan s heir was not yet three years old, showing the vulnerability of the pontiff.",
        "target_summary": "The formidable Borgia family, a powerful and often ruthless force in Renaissance Italy, navigated a world of shifting alliances and deep intrigue under Pope Alexander VI, whose children, Juan, Cesare, and Lucrezia, each played pivotal roles in their dynastic ambitions.\n\nJuan, the Pope's adored eldest son and Duke of Gandia, was initially destined for a brilliant future, showered with unprecedented titles, wealth, and influence. After furthering Borgia power through marriage in Spain, he returned to Rome as the Vatican's formidable military commander, charged with seizing lands from rival families like the Orsinis. However, his meteoric rise was tragically and mysteriously cut short in 1497 when, at just 21, he was brutally stabbed and his body cast into the Tiber. Alexander VI's desolation was absolute, famously declaring he would give \"seven papacies\" to restore his son to life. The murder remained an enduring Renaissance mystery: while common robbery was ruled out by his intact purse, suspicion fell upon the vengeful Orsinis, his former brother-in-law Giovanni Sforza, or even his intellectually superior and increasingly ambitious brother, Cesare. Juan's death severely impacted the family's hold on power, revealing the pontiff's vulnerability.\n\nCesare, a man described as having \"great talent and an excellent nature,\" initially chafed under an unwanted ecclesiastical career. Recognizing his father as a master of Renaissance politics, he finally secured permission to abandon his cardinal's robes after Juan's death. Stepping decisively into the void, Cesare emerged as a formidable military commander, relentlessly conquering cities in a determined bid to carve out a Borgia state. Though Juan had been favored with titles, Cesare's intellectual prowess and strategic ruthlessness quickly made his influence paramount, even as his growing power was despised by allies. The strained relationship between the two brothers, with Cesare's talent juxtaposed against Juan's mediocre military skills and reputation as a pleasure-seeker, fueled malicious rumors of sibling rivalry over their sister-in-law, Sancha, and political jealousy, making Cesare a prime suspect in Juan's unsolved murder.\n\nLucrezia, the Pope's \"jewel of the family,\" was renowned for her beauty, sweet nature, and refinement, enjoying a profound bond of affection with her father. Yet, she was also a pawn in the Borgias' political machinations. Her first marriage, to Giovanni Sforza, was annulled, prompting Sforza to propagate the infamous \"black legend\" – scandalous accusations of incest between Lucrezia and her father or brothers. These rumors, coupled with the mysterious arrival of a baby whose parentage was veiled in secrecy, were eagerly spread by rival Italian families seeking to undermine the \"outsider\" Borgias. Despite their often-exaggerated nature, these tales cemented the Borgias' reputation for ruthlessness. Desiring peace and freedom from her father's loving yet controlling influence, Lucrezia ultimately married Alfonso d'Este, heir to the duchies of Ferrara, allowing her to escape the treacherous currents of Roman intrigue and carve out a life of her own, a separation her deeply affectionate father reluctantly accepted.\n\nThe opulent and self-aggrandizing spirit of the Borgia papacy is also beautifully preserved within the Vatican Apartments, commissioned by Alexander VI and sumptuously painted by Pinturicchio. Rooms like the \"Room of the Saints\" are lavishly adorned with frescoes depicting courtly life and religious narratives, cleverly weaving in portraits of the Borgia family. Lucrezia appears as the serene St. Catherine of Alexandria, surrounded by figures like the Ottoman prince Djem, while Alexander VI's heraldic bull and inscriptions celebrating him as \"he who loves peace\" assert the family's power and divine mandate. These artistic masterpieces stand as a vibrant testament to the Borgias' ambition, their controversial reign, and the dramatic lives they lived at the apex of Renaissance power and intrigue.",

        "content": "Next, Brier and Wade dehydrated the body using natron, a mineral of equal parts salt and baking soda that forms naturally in Egyptian wadis, or dry gullies. Like a sponge, natron sucks the moisture out of flesh, leaving it too dry to support bacteria, maggots, beetles, and other putrefying agents; the leftover tissue is essentially jerky. (Fully committed to authenticity, Brier dug the natron himself in Egypt, and recalls that sneaking hundreds of pounds of unidentified white powder through customs at JFK Airport was one of the more ticklish aspects of the project. Luckily, he was traveling with a film crew, and could hide the powder in suitcases amid their equipment.) In their lab, Brier and Wade placed the mummy s spleen, lungs, liver, and intestines into bowls and covered them with natron. They also packed 29 linen bags of the powder into the body s empty torso, laid the body on top of 211 more pounds, and dumped 583 additional pounds over it. They kept the body in Wade s old office, with the heat cranked up to 104 F and dehumidifiers running night and day to simulate Egyptian air.

Pat Remler Natron, a naturally forming mineral made of salt and baking soda, was placed on the table before the body was set on top. Pat Remler The body was then covered with more natron and was left to dehydrate. Pat Remler Over the next five weeks, the natron on top turned crusty and brown from absorbing bodily juices, forcing Brier and Wade to crack through it with an iron rod. (Today Brier remembers the odor as acrid but not unpleasant, although news reports at the time say he and Wade donned surgical masks against the smell.) Regardless, the sight of the body beneath thrilled Brier. As it dries, the skin of mummies tightens and shrivels, especially on the face and scalp. The lips retract to reveal the teeth, and skin with less melanin turns brown- yellow. Brier always wondered whether those changes resulted from the immediate mummification process, or from several thousand years of weathering in Egypt s arid climate. One glance at his mummy and Brier knew the answer: even after five weeks,  he looked just like Ramses the Great,  he recalls, with leathery skin, a beaky nose, and wispy hair sticking up. The embalming process, not time, made the iconic mummies we know today. Beyond changing the body s appearance, the dehydration process left the limbs as stiff as tree branches, and dropped its weight from 188 pounds to just 79. (Thirty- one pounds of that represented the removal of organs.) The organs drying in the bowls withered as well, which helped explain another mystery of Egyptian mummification: as other archaeologists have noted, embalmers typically placed the organs in so called canopic jars, funerary vessels with slim necks so slim that it seemed impossible to fit the larger organs inside. But the natron shrunk them down enough to slip right in. (This is the earliest Egyptian embalming recipe.) After removing him from the natron, Brier and Wade gave Mr. Balm a full body massage with lotus, cedar, and palm oils, another step that, while important ritualistically, also had pragmatic benefits restoring flexibility to the joints, making the mummy easier to handle. This accomplished, they wrapped the body in linen bandages. (Embalmers in ancient times started with the hands and feet, wrapping each digit separately, then proceeded to the arms, legs, and torso. The penis was individually wrapped as well or, if embarrassingly shriveled, a cod piece of stiff linen was bound in place.) At this point, they let the mummy dry for three more months in the arid office, which dropped its weight to 51 pounds. Afterward, they added several more layers of wrappings. In between the layers, they slipped magic amulets and scraps of papyrus with spells on them, a common practice in ancient times.",
        "target_summary": "Brier and Wade embarked on an authentic mummification process, commencing with the critical dehydration stage using natron—a natural mineral blend of salt and baking soda. This powerful desiccant, meticulously sourced from Egyptian wadis, was designed to draw all moisture from the flesh, transforming it into a state too dry for putrefying agents.\n\nIn a carefully recreated lab environment, mimicking the arid Egyptian climate with 104 F heat and continuous dehumidification, the team precisely applied the natron. Internal organs were first submerged, while the body itself was generously packed and covered with hundreds of pounds of the mineral. Over the subsequent five weeks, the natron absorbed the body's fluids, turning crusty and brown, necessitating its periodic breaking with an iron rod.\n\nBrier was captivated by the dramatic transformations: the skin tightened and shriveled, lips retracted to reveal teeth, and lighter skin tones developed a distinct brown-yellow hue. This immediate post-mummification appearance, remarkably akin to iconic pharaohs with leathery skin and a prominent nose, confirmed his hypothesis that the embalming process itself, not millennia of weathering, crafted the timeless visage of ancient mummies.\n\nPhysically, the dehydration left limbs as stiff as branches and drastically reduced the body's weight from 188 to 79 pounds, also explaining how large organs could shrink sufficiently to fit into narrow-necked canopic jars. Following this, the mummy received a restorative full-body massage with lotus, cedar, and palm oils, a ritualistic step that also pragmatically restored flexibility.\n\nThe process concluded with the initial wrapping in linen bandages, followed by an additional three months of drying, which further reduced the mummy’s weight to 51 pounds. Finally, several more layers of linen were applied, interspersed with protective magic amulets and papyrus scrolls, faithfully echoing ancient embalming traditions.",

        "title": "Cleopatra, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony: how the last pharaoh's love affairs shaped Ancient Egypt's fate",
        "content": "Cleopatra was a daughter of Egypt   part of the Macedonian-Greek-Ptolemaic Dynasty that had ruled since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. Queen of Egypt, Cyrene and Cyprus, she was renowned for her passionate nature, beauty, intellect and determination to advance the interests of the Ptolemaic legacy. Ad They were masters of ancient Rome   powerful, ruthless military generals who had expanded the sphere of Roman influence, seizing power for themselves and seeking to add the vast Egyptian empire to Rome s ever-expanding list of conquests. The relationships between Cleopatra VII, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony were love affairs, and power struggles, that would change the course of Egyptian and Roman history, forever. Cleopatra and Caesar: how did their love affairs begin? It was Cleopatra s father, Ptolemy XII, who had effectively opened the door to the Romans. When Ptolemy XI was killed in 80 BC, his only male heirs were Ptolemy XII and his younger brother   the illegitimate sons of Ptolemy IX. Ptolemy XII was crowned in 76 BC but, soon after, the question of his legitimacy was raised in Rome, where anti-Senate politicians claimed to be in possession of a will, written by Ptolemy XI, that bequeathed Egypt to the Romans. Fearing the loss of the throne and an end to his dynasty, Ptolemy took a huge risk: he struck a deal with Rome.  | Your guide to the Roman Republic Desperate to retain his kingship, Ptolemy asked Caesar and Pompey to recognise him as Egypt s legal ruler and a comrade and ally of Rome. This they did, for the price of 6,000 talents   an enormous amount, of which some was borrowed from Roman moneylenders. When Rome moved in on the Egyptian territory of Cyprus the following year, Ptolemy did nothing. The Egyptian people were outraged, and banished their Pharaoh, leaving his wife and eldest daughter to rule in his stead. Ptolemy XII: Cleopatra's father from hell The tragic fate of Cleopatra has long overshadowed her predecessor, Ptolemy XII. But, as Diana T Nikolova explains, it s impossible to understand the daughter s downfall without exploring the father s hapless reign  Although Ptolemy was eventually restored to the throne, again with the help of the Roman Senate, the damage had been done. Egypt was weak, and Rome had its sights firmly set on conquest. To further compound matters, Ptolemy XII made the Roman Senate executor of his will (which proclaimed his eldest surviving daughter, Cleopatra, and eldest son co-regents), and his extensive bribery had left the realm in financial straits: Rome s foothold in Egypt looked sure to extend. In 51 BC, 18-year-old Cleopatra emerged onto the political scene as co-regent of Egypt with her younger brother and (in true Egyptian royal tradition) husband, ten-year-old Ptolemy XIII. Like her father before her, Cleopatra sought absolute power in Egypt, and soon set about dropping her brother s name from official documents. But, with Egypt facing economic failures, famine and crippling debt, Cleopatra realised she, too, needed the help of mighty Rome to lead Egypt back to peace and prosperity once more. Only this time, it would be on her terms. Cleopatra was not the only one harbouring a desire for sole control of Egypt. In 48 BC, encouraged by his court advisors, Ptolemy XIII banished Cleopatra from Alexandria and proclaimed himself sole ruler. An 18th-century depiction of Caesar meeting Cleopatra, by artist Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo. (Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) The battle lines had been drawn between the sibling spouses and Cleopatra, alone and powerless, hatched a plan to gain the ear of Caesar, who was merrily celebrating victory over his one-time comrade Pompey, at the battle of Pharsalus. As luck would have it, Caesar and his troops were already in Alexandria (he was in pursuit of his adversary Pompey who, having been defeated, was hoping for assistance from Ptolemy XIII). All Cleopatra had to do was enter Alexandria unseen and talk to Caesar before he reached his own agreement with her brother. It was an idea easier said than done. Fully prepared to seduce Caesar in order to enlist his help, Cleopatra planned to smuggle herself into Alexandria and inside the royal palace, where Caesar was staying as her brother s honoured guest. Greek historian Plutarch, writing more than a century later, described how Cleopatra achieved her mission:  [Cleopatra] embarked in a little skiff and landed at the palace when it was already getting dark; and as it was impossible to escape notice otherwise, she stretched herself at full length inside a bed-sack, while Apollodorus [her servant] tied the bed-sack up with a cord and carried it indoors to Caesar.

(Photo by Silver Screen Collection/ Getty Images) What did Cleopatra and Caesar think of each other? Caesar   a man some 30 years her senior   seems to have been instantly captivated by the Egyptian Queen and, after  succumbing to the charm of further intercourse with her, he reconciled her to her brother on the basis of a joint share with him in the royal power . Suetonius tells us that Caesar was smitten by Cleopatra.  He often feasted with her until daybreak, and they would have sailed together in her barge nearly to Ethiopia had his soldiers agreed to follow him.  Cleopatra finally had the military support she needed to rule Egypt.  | What did Cleopatra look like? Her brother-husband was livid. On finding his banished sister and Caesar together at the palace, having clearly spent the night together, he reputedly flung his diadem to the ground and stormed out of the room, declaring his sister a traitor to Egypt. Chaos followed. Ptolemy besieged the palace in which Caesar was staying, and Cleopatra s younger sister, Arsinoe, also joined in the fight. She declared herself to be the true queen of Egypt and led rebel forces against her siblings. Ptolemy XIV (depicted left), Cleopatra's brother-husband, was livid when he found his banished sister and Caesar together at the palace. (Photo by Archive Photos/Getty Images) All must have seemed lost for Cleopatra and her Roman lover but, with the arrival of Caesar s troops from Syria, the tide turned once more. Ptolemy and Arsinoe were both defeated. Cleopatra s seat as Egyptian ruler now seemed secure   she was even pregnant with Caesar s child (some time between 47 and 44 BC Cleopatra gave birth to a son whom she named Ptolemy Caesar, or Caesarion]. But, instead, of declaring Cleopatra sole ruler of Egypt, the Roman general instead made her co-ruler with her remaining brother, and soon-to-be husband, 12-year-old Ptolemy XIV In June 47 BC, Cleopatra gave birth to a son, Ptolemy Caesar, known as Caesarion    little Caesar    although the child was never formally acknowledged by his father. The pair followed Caesar to Rome, where they were officially welcomed as  friends and allies of the Roman people . Cleopatra and Caesar: how did Rome react? Beneath the veneer of its friendly exterior, Rome was furious. Caesar had no sons from his Roman wife, Calpurnia, and none from his previous wives. The idea of Caesarion   the son of a foreigner from a land despised as a pleasure-loving and decadent society   growing up to claim rule over  civilised  Rome as Caesar s heir, was intolerable. That situation never came to pass, however, as the Caesar named his grandnephew Octavian (who would later take the name Augustus) as his heir. Caesar: Death of a Dictator Member exclusive | On the Ides of March 44 BC, the most famous Roman in history was murdered. Julius Caesar's assassination transformed Rome forever, and the image of his bloody toga has haunted monarchs and tyrants ever since. Listen to all episodes now On the Ides of March 44 BC, the most famous Roman in history was murdered. Julius Caesar's assassination transformed Rome forever, and the image of his bloody toga has haunted monarchs and tyrants ever since. When did Cleopatra and Caesar's relationship end? In 44 BC, when Caesar was assassinated, Cleopatra   a much-disliked figure in Rome, whose gold-covered statue stood in the city s temple of Venus Genetrix   fled from Rome with her son. Just months later, the Egyptian Queen s second brother-husband was also dead   likely on her orders   and Cleopatra was free to rule with her three-year-old son, and plan the infant s succession as Emperor of Rome. Cleopatra meets Mark Antony Meanwhile, disputes had broken out over who would succeed Caesar, with both Octavian and the Roman general Mark Antony seeking power. By 41 BC, the leadership had been split: Antony was governing the eastern region and Octavian, the west. Following Cleopatra s return, Rome had left Egypt in relative peace, but the Senate s eyes turned once more to the wealthy empire, when Antony decided he needed money to subdue his enemies in the Parthian Empire (now Iraq). Conveniently, Cleopatra had befriended Mark Antony during her time in Rome, and supported him militarily during the ensuing civil war. She now agreed to meet him in Tarsus (modern-day Turkey) to discuss the prospect of Egyptian support in a war against the Parthians. When did Cleopatra and Mark Antony become lovers? In an echo of plans made seven years earlier with her former lover, Cleopatra set out for Tarsus in 41 BC to charm and seduce her unsuspecting old friend. This time, however, her entrance was somewhat grander. In Plutarch s words:  [Cleopatra] came sailing up the River Cydnus in a barge with gilded stern and outspread sails of purple, while oars of silver beat time to the music of flutes and fifes and harps. She herself lay all along, under a canopy of cloth of gold, dressed as Venus in a picture, and beautiful young boys, like painted Cupids, stood on each side to fan her.  The soon-to-be lovers Antony and Cleopatra meet on the water in this 1885 painting. (Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Like Caesar before him, Antony was captivated.  The attraction of her person, joining with the charm of her conversation, and the character that attended all she said or did, was something bewitching,  Plutarch tells us.  It was a pleasure merely to hear the sound of her voice.  Antony was so taken with the Pharaoh that he abandoned his original reasons for meeting at Tarsus. He left his wife Fulvia to manage his affairs in Rome and his troops waiting for orders, while he spent the winter of 41 40 BC in Alexandria with Cleopatra. They were inseparable. During his stay, Cleopatra gained Antony s support in ridding her of the one person who had the power to disrupt her absolute rule in Egypt: Arsinoe. Defeated in battle, Arsinoe had been banished to the Temple of Artemis in Roman-controlled Ephesus, in modern-day Turkey. In 41 BC, on Antony s orders and in scandalous violation of the sanctuary she d been promised, Arsinoe was murdered on the temple steps. The following year Cleopatra gave birth to twins: Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II. Antony, however, had finally been forced to return to Rome to deal with the aftermath of his failed rebellion against Octavian. A political alliance known as the Second Triumvirate was formed between the two generals and a dignitary named Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Recently widowed, Antony agreed to seal the peace deal with a marriage to Octavian s sister, Octavia Minor, in 40 BC. But Cleopatra was never far from Antony s mind and, in 37 BC, he returned to Alexandria where he fathered another son, Ptolemy Philadelphus, and Cleopatra and Caesarion were crowned co-rulers of Egypt and Cyprus. What happened to the Temple of Artemis and the other Seven Wonders of the Ancient World? \"Despite only being a short-lived collection   the last to be completed, the Colossus of Rhodes, stood for less than 60 years   and one of them, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, possibly not existing at all, the Wonders continue to capture imaginations...\" What happened to Cleopatra and Mark Antony? For a happy ending, the story should end there. But it doesn t. Ever greedy for power, Octavian continued to campaign for sole power in Rome, successfully eliminating Lepidus from the Triumvirate. In 33 BC, allegedly in retaliation for Antony divorcing his sister, Octavian did the unthinkable: he declared war on the Egyptian queen. Two years later, in 31 BC, the combined armies of Antony and Cleopatra took on Octavian s forces in a great sea battle at Actium, off Greece s west coast. The battle was a disaster for the lovers. Victorious, Octavian invaded Egypt where he received the surrender of the defeated Roman forces. Antony s efforts to become sole ruler of the Roman world had ended and, first believing that his amour had forged an agreement with Octavian to ensure her own survival, and then that she had committed suicide, he attempted to fall on his sword in true Roman tradition. But even in this he failed, and his wounded body was taken to Cleopatra who, still very much alive, was hiding in a mausoleum. There, Antony succumbed to his wounds, reportedly dying in his lover s arms. Cleopatra realised that without her lover and his troops, she and her beloved country were now at the mercy of the triumphant Octavian. Knowing she would be paraded around as his prisoner should she be captured, the proud Egyptian Queen chose to take her own life, reputedly by allowing a poisonous Egyptian cobra, or aspis, to bite her. Rome had emerged victorious: the age of the Pharaohs was dead. Cleopatra: what is the real legacy of the last pharaoh? For more than 2,000 years Cleopatra VII, final ruler of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, has been portrayed as a manipulative but tragic beauty. Yet, as Joann Fletcher reveals, such simplistic portrayals obscure her true legacy as a strong, politically astute monarch... What happened to Cleopatra's son, Caesarion? Following the deaths of Cleopatra and Mark Antony, the victorious Octavian changed his name to Augustus Caesar and assumed sole control of Rome as its emperor, administering to Egypt s people and controlling its treasury himself. But one last threat to his rule remained: Caesar and Cleopatra s son, Caesarion. Advised by his confidant and philosopher Arius Didymus that  too many Caesars is not good , the new Emperor planned his rival s murder, luring Caesarion to Alexandria with false promises of his safety. The exact circumstances of Caesarion s death are unknown, but it is thought that he may have been strangled, after which Augustus took absolute control of Egypt. The three children Cleopatra bore Mark Antony had different fates to their half brother. Following their parents  deaths, the three were paraded through the streets of Rome in heavy gold chains, walking behind an effigy of their mother: twins Cleopatra Selene and Alexander Helios were ten, while Ptolemy Philadelphus was just four. Ad The three children were given into the care of their former step-mother, Octavia. The two boys disappeared without trace a few years later, but the young Cleopatra later married King Juba II of Mauretania where we know she had at least one child, named Ptolemy Philadelphus, thought to have been named after her younger, missing brother.",

Great reputations Member exclusive | In our podcast series, expert historians discuss the contested reputations of key historical figures, charting the lives and afterlives of Cleopatra, Napoleon Bonaparte, Emmeline Pankhurst and more  Listen to all episodes now In our podcast series, expert historians discuss the contested reputations of key historical figures, charting the lives and afterlives of Cleopatra, Napoleon Bonaparte, Emmeline Pankhurst and more  How did Cleopatra become queen? For Cleopatra, life as a royal daughter was one of luxury. The Egyptian capital Alexandria, the seat of Ptolemaic power, was a thriving cultural centre, attracting scholars, artists and philosophers from all over the world. It was also home to the great Pharos of Alexandria   the 137-metre-tall lighthouse that towered over the city and one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Cleopatra s first taste of power came at the tender age of 14, when she was made co-regent with her father, following his restoration to the throne after three years in exile, albeit with limited powers. Ptolemy XII s return to the throne had cost Cleopatra s elder sister, Berenice   who had seized power in his absence   her life. There may have been a further elder sister, Cleopatra VI Tryphaena, but she too had died by this point. All of this meant that it was 18-year-old Cleopatra who became co-regent with her brother, Ptolemy XIII (aged ten), when her father died in March 51 BC. In true pharaonic tradition, which aimed to keep the royal bloodline as pure as possible, Cleopatra married her younger brother and co-ruler, but it soon became clear that she had no intention of sharing power with him. Within months, Ptolemy XIII s name had been dropped from official documents and Cleopatra s face appeared alone on coins. Cleopatra: what is the real legacy of the last pharaoh? For more than 2,000 years Cleopatra VII, final ruler of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, has been portrayed as a manipulative but tragic beauty. Yet, as Joann Fletcher reveals, such simplistic portrayals obscure her true legacy as a strong, politically astute monarch... Cleopatra is often portrayed by Hollywood as a glamorous femme fatale. Mary Hamer argues that most of what we think we know about Cleopatra is merely the echo of Roman propaganda. Here, she reveals six lesser-know facts about the Egyptian ruler  Cleopatra made an ally of Julius Caesar, who helped to establish her on the throne She then invited him to join her on a voyage up the Nile, and when she subsequently gave birth to a son, she named the baby Caesarion    little Caesar . In Rome this caused a scandal. This was, firstly, because Egypt and its pleasure-loving culture were despised as decadent. But it was also because Caesar had no other sons   though he was married to Calpurnia, and had had two wives before her   and he had just made himself the most powerful man in Rome. Elite Romans were meant to share power, but Caesar seemed to want to be supreme, like a monarch. It was a doubly unbearable prospect: Caesarion, an Egyptian, just might grow up to claim to rule over Rome as Caesar s heir. Fantasies about Cleopatra s beauty are just that Plutarch, the Greek biographer of Mark Antony, claimed it wasn t so much her looks that were so compelling, but her conversation and her intelligence. Cleopatra took control of the way she appeared, coming across differently according to political need. For example, at ceremonial events she would appear dressed as the goddess Isis: it was common for Egyptian rulers to identify themselves with an established deity. On her coins minted in Egypt, meanwhile, she chose to be shown with her father s strong jaw line, to emphasise her inherited right to rule. Sculptures don t give us much of a clue to her looks either: there are two or three heads in the classical style, but also a number of full-length statues in Egyptian style, and her appearance in these is quite different.  | What did Cleopatra really look like? A coin with the head of Cleopatra. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) Cleopatra was living in Rome, as the mistress of Julius Caesar, at the time that he was assassinated Caesar s assassination in 44 BC meant Cleopatra herself was in danger, so she left at once. With her little son, Caesarion, she had been living in a palace of her own on the other side of the river Tiber from Caesar s household (though it is likely she hadn t taken up permanent residence there, but returned on regular visits from Egypt). Not surprisingly, Cleopatra had been much disliked in a city that had got rid of its kings, for she d insisted on being addressed as  queen . It can t have helped that to honour her, Caesar had placed a statue of Cleopatra covered in gold in the temple of Venus Genetrix   the goddess who brings forth life, who was held in high regard by his family. Cleopatra was a mother as well as the ruler of Egypt She had Caesarion, her eldest son, represented on the temple wall at Dendera alongside her, as sharing her rule. After her death, the Roman emperor Augustus lured Caesarion back with promises of power, only to have him killed. He was aged 16 or 17, though some sources say he was as young as 14. Mark Antony was the father of Cleopatra s other children, Ptolemy Philadelphus and the twins, Cleopatra Selene and Alexander Helios. The twins were aged 10 and Ptolemy six when their mother died. They were taken to Rome and treated well in the household of Mark Antony s widow, Octavia, where they were educated. The adult Cleopatra Selene was married to Juba, a minor king, and sent to rule with him over Mauretania. She gave birth to another Ptolemy   Cleopatra s only known grandchild. He died in adulthood by order of his cousin, Caligula, so none of Cleopatra s descendants lived to inherit Egypt.

(Photo by World History Archive / Alamy) When we refer to the eighth month as  August , we are celebrating the defeat and death of Cleopatra Augustus founded his reign on the defeat of Cleopatra. When he had the chance to have a month named in his own honour, instead of choosing September   the month of his birth   he chose the eighth month, in which Cleopatra died, to create a yearly reminder of her defeat. Augustus would have liked to lead Cleopatra as a captive through Rome, as other generals did with their prisoners, in the formal triumphs that celebrated their victories. But she killed herself to prevent that. Cleopatra didn t die for love. Like Mark Antony, who killed himself because there was no longer a place of honour for him in the world, Cleopatra chose to die rather than suffer the violence of being paraded, shamed and helpless, through Rome. Augustus had to make do with an image of her that was carried through the streets instead. Cleopatra s name was Greek, but it doesn t mean that she was Cleopatra s family was descended from the Macedonian general Ptolemy, who had picked up Egypt in the shareout after Alexander died. But 250 years then passed before Cleopatra was born   12 generations, with all their love affairs and secret assignations. Today we know that at least one child in 10 is not attributed to their correct biological father    Momma s baby, Poppa s maybe , as they say. Egypt s population included people of many different ethnicities, and naturally that included Africans, since Egypt was a part of Africa. So it s not at all unlikely that long before Cleopatra was born, her Greek heritage had become mixed with other strains.

        "target_summary": "Cleopatra VII, born around 69 BC, was Ancient Egypt's most celebrated and final active pharaoh, a captivating figure whose reign from 51 to 30 BC marked a pivotal era in history. Descended from the Macedonian-Greek Ptolemaic dynasty, her early life in the thriving cultural hub of Alexandria, though luxurious, was shadowed by fierce family rivalries. At just 18, she ascended to the throne, initially sharing power with her younger brother-husband Ptolemy XIII, whom she swiftly marginalized, revealing her formidable will to rule alone.\n\nHer story is famously intertwined with two of Rome's most influential leaders: Julius Caesar, with whom she bore a son, Caesarion, and later Mark Antony, who fathered her three other children. These alliances, often romanticized, were deeply strategic moves to secure Egypt's sovereignty against an encroaching Roman Empire. While popular legend paints her as a fabled beauty and manipulative *femme fatale*—a narrative largely shaped by Roman propaganda—historical accounts reveal a profound intellect and political astuteness. She was remembered as a scholar in Arab traditions and skillfully cultivated her image, even appearing as the goddess Isis for political effect.\n\nUltimately, her and Antony's ambition to challenge Rome culminated in a devastating defeat, sealing Egypt's fate. Rather than endure the profound humiliation of being paraded as a captive through Roman streets by Octavian (later Augustus), Cleopatra chose a dramatic end, taking her own life in 30 BC, famously through a serpent's bite. Though her children's lineages were tragically extinguished by Roman decree, her enigmatic persona, a blend of power, passion, and strategic genius, ensured her immortality, celebrated and reinterpreted across centuries in art, literature, and film. She remains a compelling heroine whose complex legacy continues to fascinate.",

        "content": "Cleopatra is always newsworthy. So when in February 2007 a small coin in the collection of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle was said to have changed our understanding of her, it made headlines around the world. Ad Journalists reacted with shock. Cleopatra was no beauty queen, said the reports. The face on the coin was nothing like that of Elizabeth Taylor. Instead she looked  plain , even  shrewish , and had a  hook-like hooter . This was announced as a revelation. Yet for all the fanfare, there was nothing particularly unusual about the Newcastle coin. There are plenty of coins surviving with Cleopatra s portrait on them, and they generally repeat the same features that seemed to astound reporters: a prominent nose, sloping forehead, sharply pointed chin and thin lips, and hollow-looking eye sockets. Where was Cleopatra from? Born c69 BC, Cleopatra was the third of a possible six children, all of whom shared a common father, Ptolemy XII. The Ptolemaic dynasty, a Macedonian-Greek royal family that had ties to Alexander the Great, had ruled Egypt since 305 BC. Traditionally male rulers took the name Ptolemy, while Ptolemaic Queens were usually named Cleopatra, Arsino  or Berenice.  about Cleopatra's life What did Cleopatra look like? These coin portraits, surprising though they may be to those who have grown up with a  Hollywood Cleopatra , are the only certain images we have of her. That hasn t stopped people from attempting to dismiss them as inaccurate and overly stylised   hoping against hope that there could have been another face of Cleopatra, a hidden one whose face would better match our expectations. Perhaps, they suggest, these unconvincing portraits were the work of unskilled artists. There s no reason to think these coin portraits are wrong, however. At the time, a warts-and-all approach to portraiture was in vogue in the Mediterranean world, and it seems that Cleopatra s image was no exception to this trend. Features like large noses or determined chins may have been slightly exaggerated, but only because those features were the most recognisable attributes of the individual being portrayed. In this sense they were intended to be realistic. Coin portraits of Cleopatra s father show him with a prominent nose and sloping forehead, so these physical characteristics may well have been family traits Coin portraits of Cleopatra s father, much rarer than those of Cleopatra herself, show him with a prominent nose and sloping forehead, so these physical characteristics may well have been family traits. Her lovers don t match modern popular conceptions either: Julius Caesar has a wrinkled, scrawny neck and hides his bald head with a crown, and Antony s jutting chin and broken nose bear no resemblance to Richard Burton s features.

(Owen Humphreys/PA Wire) The coins were minted in a variety of places in the eastern Mediterranean, from Alexandria in Egypt to the port of Patras in Greece. Mark Antony bestowed on Cleopatra a number of eastern cities and territories, and coins were issued in those places in the name of the new ruler. Though the portraits found on the coins vary in style from artist to artist, they are generally consistent in detail, which suggests that the artists were following guidelines when they engraved the dies to strike the coins. It s likely that they were copying an official image that the queen herself had approved   nose and chin included.

Despite her legendary fondness for dressing up, the portraits are rather modest. Cleopatra wears the cloth diadem of a Hellenistic ruler around her head. Her hair is drawn back in braids and coiled in a bun at the base of her skull. Over her shoulders she wears a mantle, covering her gown. A discreet earring hangs from her earlobe, and around her neck is a string of pearls   the only hint of the riches described by the Roman poet Lucan, who pictures a dissolute Cleopatra as decked out  on neck and hair with all the Red Sea spoils . On some coins her mantle seems to be held in place by a clasp that includes more strings of pearls   a treasure that perhaps held great significance at the time (a gift from Caesar or Antony?) Most of the coin portraits date to the mid to late 30s BC, when Cleopatra herself was in her mid to late thirties. Often she is associated with Mark Antony, whose portrait appears on the other side (and occasionally on the same side, next to hers), but she is always described as a queen in her own right, and not just Antony s consort:  Queen Cleopatra, the New Goddess ;  For Cleopatra, Queen of Kings and of children who are kings . On some coins depicting her by herself there is no name attached at all   those distinctive features told people who they were looking at. A coin with the head of Cleopatra. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) The modern negative reaction to the face of Cleopatra tells us more about our love of stories than anything about this most famous of Egyptian queens, who ruled from 51 to 30 BC. For us, the reality of her coin portraits clashes with the much greater myth of Cleopatra, a myth so grand that it has practically consumed the person behind it. Was Cleopatra's beauty a myth? Hollywood did not invent the tradition of the beautiful seductress; that we can believe so says much about its influence in our world. Instead it simply followed a longstanding convention. Hardly had Cleopatra died (allegedly from an asp bite) then the legends began to accrue. In 31 BC she and her lover, Mark Antony, had been defeated by their rival Octavian, and in the following year they died by suicide in Egypt. Octavian had triumphed, but he was the victor in a vicious civil war that had pitted Roman against Roman. The modern negative reaction to the face of Cleopatra tells us more about our love of stories than anything about this most famous of Egyptian queens Cleopatra was a convenient scapegoat. Octavian claimed to have waged war against the foreign queen, not Antony. In this way Antony could be portrayed as a virtuous Roman who had betrayed his homeland through the machinations of an evil temptress. Cleopatra was cast as an irresistible and exotic femme fatale, and Roman writers picked up the theme. The poet Horace declared her a  deadly monster , and Propertius, with even less delicacy, called the queen a  whore . Yet she needed more exceptional qualities to have conquered both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony: according to the Roman historian Cassius Dio she was  a woman of surpassing beauty  with the power to subjugate everyone . Cleopatra's face on a coin. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) But not all were taken in by this. The Greek biographer Plutarch, writing about a century after Cleopatra s death, had his doubts about her unparalleled physical qualities.  Her beauty was in itself not altogether incomparable , he wrote,  nor such as to strike those who saw her , but he nonetheless credits her with an  irresistible charm . Intelligent and talented, Cleopatra had a gift for making people feel they were the focus of her attention   and that quality, rather than her looks, was her winning trait with Caesar and Antony. Even Cassius Dio conceded that Cleopatra  had a knowledge of how to make herself agreeable to everyone . This is perhaps the closest we can get to the real Cleopatra and the character behind the face on the coins. The beautiful and scheming seductress was a creation of Octavian s propaganda, and unwittingly he created history s greatest love story. But the coins present us with another kind of story   of two ambitious political figures weaving a future together: Antony the Roman triumvir and Cleopatra the queen of kings. Not as romantic, but possibly a face of Cleopatra that the queen herself would have recognised, and of which she would have approved. Ad This article was first published by HistoryExtra in 2016",
        "target_summary": "A modern revelation in 2007, spurred by a small coin in Newcastle, dramatically challenged the popular image of Cleopatra, particularly her famed beauty. Journalists reacted with shock, proclaiming the face on the coin was far from the idealized Hollywood portrayal, instead depicting a \"plain,\" \"shrewish\" figure with a \"hook-like hooter.\" This \"revelation,\" however, was hardly new to historians. Numerous surviving coins consistently present Cleopatra with a prominent nose, a sloping forehead, sharply pointed chin, and thin lips, features that starkly contrast with the ethereal beauty we often associate with her.\n\nThese ancient coin portraits, the only reliable images we possess of the Egyptian queen, are not artistic blunders. They reflect the \"warts-and-all\" approach to portraiture prevalent in the Mediterranean world during her era. Far from attempting to flatter, these images sought realism, perhaps even exaggerating distinctive features like the nose or chin to ensure immediate recognition. Such traits, including a prominent nose and sloping forehead, also appear on coins of her father, Ptolemy XII, suggesting they were indeed family characteristics of the Macedonian-Greek Ptolemaic dynasty that ruled Egypt.\n\nMinted across the eastern Mediterranean, these coins attest to Cleopatra's considerable political authority. She is often depicted alongside Mark Antony, yet always proclaimed as \"Queen Cleopatra, the New Goddess\" or \"Queen of Kings,\" never merely a consort. Her attire on these portraits is notably modest: a Hellenistic ruler's cloth diadem, braided hair coiled in a bun, and a mantle covering her gown. Only subtle hints of wealth appear, such as a discreet earring or a string of pearls, a far cry from the opulent, \"dissolute Cleopatra\" later described by Roman poets. These consistent depictions across varied locations and artists suggest they were based on an official, queen-approved image, nose and chin included.\n\nThe enduring myth of Cleopatra as an incomparably beautiful seductress, capable of captivating the most powerful Roman leaders, largely stems not from historical reality but from political propaganda. After her defeat and suicide alongside Mark Antony, Octavian, her rival, strategically crafted a narrative to justify his civil war. He portrayed Antony as a virtuous Roman led astray by an \"evil temptress,\" casting Cleopatra as an irresistible, exotic *femme fatale*. Roman writers eagerly embraced this theme, describing her as a \"deadly monster\" and a \"whore,\" yet paradoxically imbuing her with \"surpassing beauty\" necessary to conquer Caesar and Antony.\n\nHowever, the Greek biographer Plutarch, writing a century after her death, offered a more nuanced and likely accurate assessment. He observed that her physical beauty was \"not altogether incomparable,\" nor such \"as to strike those who saw her.\" Instead, Plutarch credited her with an \"irresistible charm,\" an extraordinary intelligence, and a remarkable gift for making everyone feel like the focus of her attention. It was this captivating charisma, rather than breathtaking looks, that truly won over Caesar and Antony.\n\nUltimately, the humble coin portraits offer a profound corrective to centuries of myth. They reveal not the Hollywood siren, but a powerful, ambitious political figure – a queen of kings – whose distinct, somewhat austere features would have been instantly recognizable to her subjects. The dramatic disparity between her historical likeness and her legendary allure speaks volumes about humanity's enduring fascination with grand stories, often overshadowing the complex reality of historical figures like Cleopatra.",

        "content": "Cleopatra VII was the Egyptian queen who Romans loved to hate. By the end of 30 BC, her reputation plumbed the depths. She was, after all, the  fatal monster  who had seduced Mark Antony and lured him into an alliance that had ended in defeat to Rome s emperor-in-waiting, Octavian. The whole squalid episode had reached a climax earlier that year when, with Octavian s forces closing in on the Egyptian capital of Alexandria, the couple had taken their own lives. Ad But there s another side to this story. For at the same time as Cleopatra s name was being dragged through the mud, enthusiasm for Egypt   which Octavian had seized for the Roman empire   was at an all-time high in Rome. There was an explosion of Egypt-inspired decoration, from ornate frescoes to hulking pyramids, like Gaius Cestius Epulo s imposing tomb at the Porta San Paolo in the south of the city. On the podcast | Cleopatra: unpicking myth from reality So while Rome was consumed by a burning hatred of Cleopatra, its admiration for the kingdom that had produced her shone undimmed. One person who would, no doubt, have been baffled by this juxtaposition was Antony and Cleopatra s only daughter, Cleopatra Selene. A statue of Cleopatra Selene and her twin brother, Alexander Helios. (Photo by Alamy) Born in 40 BC and raised in the Royal Palace at Alexandria, Cleopatra Selene was around 10 years old when her parents killed themselves. She and her fraternal twin brother, Alexander Helios, and their younger brother, Ptolemy Philadelphos, were taken back to Rome with Octavian and deposited in the household of his sister   and their father s former wife   Octavia, on the Palatine Hill. While Octavian s biographer Suetonius claimed that the (future) emperor was a kindly father-figure to the children, insisting that they be cared for as if they were his own offspring, there was undoubtedly a political dimension to this decision. Retaining control of the children meant that any potential threat to Rome s power over Egypt was neutralised. The sun and the moon This control was first expressed at Octavian s Triple Triumph   an event staged to celebrate his military successes   in the summer of 29 BC. The third and final day of the triumph commemorated his conquest of Egypt, and in the absence of their mother, the children walked alongside an effigy of her entwined with the snakes that had supposedly ended her life. Cleopatra Selene was dressed as the moon and Alexander Helios as the sun, in reference to the celestial names that Antony had bestowed upon them, so as to ensure the crowds lining the processional route would recognise them. Luckily for them, unlike other enemies of Rome such as Vercingetorix of Gaul, their participation in a military triumph did not culminate in their ritual execution. But following the triumph, what was to be done with a princess who was no longer in possession of a kingdom? Octavian made sure that Antony s other surviving children were raised as traditional Romans: Iullus Antonius, Antony s son by his third wife, Fulvia, climbed the cursus honorum (ladder of offices) and was elected consul. Antonia Major and Antonia Minor, Antony s two daughters by Octavia (his fourth wife), were married to suitable Roman men and numbered among their descendants the emperors Caligula, Claudius and Nero. But Cleopatra Selene s situation was not so straightforward. She had, after all, been declared queen of Crete and Cyrenaica (part of modern-day Libya) in her own right by Antony in 34 BC, and could technically be considered the rightful queen of Egypt in the wake of her mother s death. The Death Of Cleopatra. Engraving: Domenichino, Smith. (Photo by GettyImages) Luckily for Octavian, a solution presented itself in the form of another of his wards, Gaius Julius Juba. Like Cleopatra Selene, Juba was the last scion of a deposed royal family in exile. His father, Juba I, had been king of Numidia (a region north of the Sahara), but had backed the loser in the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great. Following Pompey s defeat, Juba I had, like Cleopatra, died by suicide, and his kingdom, his treasure and his progeny had all been confiscated by Rome. Like Cleopatra Selene, Juba had been put on display in a military procession: Julius Caesar s Quadruple Triumph in 46 BC. He had been an infant at the time, and Caesar s biographer Plutarch described him as  the happiest captive ever captured . Cleopatra Selene and Juba were married in around 25 BC before being dispatched to the newly created Roman client kingdom of Mauretania (modern Morocco and Algeria). Their union was commemorated in a poem composed by the Augustan court poet Crinagoras of Mytilene:  Great bordering regions of the world which the full stream of Nile separates from the black Aethiopians, you have by marriage made your sovereigns common to both, turning Egypt and Libya into one country. May the children of these princes ever again rule with unshaken dominion over both lands.  A visible queen Mauretania was the only Roman client kingdom in the west of the empire. It was a vast territory, blessed with considerable natural resources that included many of the luxuries the Romans craved, such as purple dye, citron wood and exotic animals for the arena, as well as staples like grain and fish. It was populated by many different indigenous groups, which are today referred to collectively as  Berbers . There were also Greek and Roman colonies located along the region s Mediterranean coast. On the podcast | Roman women: everything you wanted to know While the women at the very heart of the Roman empire were expected to wield only soft power, client queens out on the periphery   in kingdoms such as Mauretania   would have been much more visible. They would have been involved in all aspects of the day-to-day running of their kingdoms as a matter of course, to the point where their subjects would have been aggrieved had they not participated fully. And of course Cleopatra Selene would have spent her childhood witnessing her mother doing just that, not only ruling her kingdom and receiving embassies from around the ancient Mediterranean, but also visiting and corresponding with other powerful women, such as Queen Amanirenas, who presided over Egypt s neighbour Kush. Cleopatra Selene would likely have seen no reason why, once a queen, she should not do the same. It is little surprise, therefore, that she showed no inclination to step aside and allow Juba to take the lead in their joint enterprise. This coin, showing Juba on one side and Cleopatra Selene on the other, suggests she saw herself as an equal partner in the relationship. (Photo by Alamy) She was, after all, the one with the more prestigious lineage going back to Ptolemy, a general of Alexander the Great, and she could also boast a direct connection to the imperial family through her half-sisters and paternal grandmother, Julia. Instead, the pair ruled together, a fact that their coinage makes abundantly clear. In coins issued jointly (like the example shown above), a portrait of Juba and the Latin legend  Rex Iuba  (King Juba) appears on one side, while a portrait of Cleopatra Selene and the Greek legend  Kleopatra Basilissa  (Queen Cleopatra) is shown on the other.  | The female 'kings' of ancient Egypt However, it is notable that Cleopatra Selene also issued her own autonomous coins. These are replete not only with references to herself through crescent moons, but also Egyptian motifs such as crocodiles, ibises, and the crown and sistrum of the goddess Isis. On one coin issue, she even styled herself  Queen Cleopatra, daughter of Queen Cleopatra . This is powerful evidence of the daughter s pride in her mother. Ever cautious and tactful, the couple gave the Mauretanian capital city, Iol, a new name   Caesarea   in Octavian s honour. However, they still found a way to honour Cleopatra and Egypt s culture within the city s walls. The pair embarked upon a lavish building programme to make it a fitting seat for their fledgling dynasty, and they clearly took inspiration from Cleopatra Selene s former home of Alexandria and her mother s building projects there. They constructed a lighthouse in the harbour akin to the famous Pharos, an extensive palace, a forum, a theatre and an amphitheatre. They also planted a sacred grove, as well as renovating old temples and dedicating new ones. Egyptian gods and goddesses soon became popular in Mauretania, and there was a temple of Isis to which Juba dedicated crocodiles. Egyptian works of art were also imported from Cleopatra Selene s former kingdom. So, in many ways, Caesarea was influenced by Alexandria, and in time it would become a highly sophisticated and multicultural court, populated by well-educated and prolific Greek, Roman, Egyptian and African scholars, and talented and creative artisans. In Juba s own writings, he included anecdotes about Egypt, Alexandria and the Nile that most likely came from Cleopatra Selene. This was a way for her to repurpose her memories of her mother and her former life in a manner acceptable to Roman readers. Issues in the afterlife Cleopatra Selene and Juba had, by all measures, turned turbulent childhoods   defeat, captivity, their parents  suicides   into a triumph. But then disaster struck. At some point around the turn of the first millennium, this north African success story was brought to a sudden end by the queen s early death. Although we don t know the precise date of Cleopatra Selene s passing, another poem composed by Crinagoras of Mytilene may provide a clue, as well as serving as an evocative eulogy to the dead queen s achievements:  The moon herself, rising at early eve, dimmed her light, veiling her mourning in night, because she saw her namesake, pretty Selene, going down dead to murky Hades. On her she had bestowed the beauty of her light, and with her death she mingled her own darkness.  In his poem, Crinagoras appears to suggest that Cleopatra Selene s death coincided with a lunar eclipse. This has led historians to propose two possible dates for her demise   23 March 5 BC and 4 May AD 3   both of which witnessed lunar eclipses that were visible in Caesarea and Rome. The queen was interred in a magnificent mausoleum, the remains of which can still be seen near Cherchell in Algeria today. Juba continued to rule Mauretania for two decades after his wife s death, and their son Ptolemy was appointed as a co-ruler in AD 21. (Note that his name was taken from his maternal rather than his paternal lineage, another indication of how Cleopatra Selene promoted her mother and her dynasty.) Tomb of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II, Tipasa ruin, Algeria (Photo by GettyImages) Even after her death, Cleopatra Selene remained a significant figure in the kingdom. A hoard deposited near Tangier contains coins that can be dated to the period AD 11 17, and includes those not only minted by Cleopatra Selene and Juba together, but also ones issued by the queen alone. This suggests that her coinage was not taken out of circulation upon her death and was still in use by her former subjects two decades later. That Juba and Ptolemy were able to stabilise their joint reign was, no doubt, thanks in part to their wife and mother s enduring lustre. Cleopatra Selene had an immense impact on her kingdom and the wider Roman world during her lifetime   even beyond it. So why is she so little known today? Paradoxically, the answer may lie in her success. Roman historians were very much fixated on what was happening in the centre of the empire. They would only mention client-kingdoms when there was a problem. The fact that they didn t write much about Mauretania suggests that things were going smoothly there.  | Timeline: the pharaohs and dynasties that ruled ancient Egypt Unlike her mother and other Roman client-queens such as Boudicca, Cleopatra Selene seems to have succeeded quietly rather than have failed loudly. As the saying goes:  Well-behaved women rarely make history.\" Jane Draycott is a lecturer in ancient history at the University of Glasgow. Her latest book, Cleopatra's Daughter, was published by Head of Zeus in November 2022. Ad This article was first published in the Christmas 2022 issue of BBC History Magazine",
        "target_summary": "Cleopatra VII, the Egyptian queen Rome vilified as a \"fatal monster\" for her alliance with Mark Antony against Octavian, met her tragic end by suicide in 30 BC. Yet, Rome's profound hatred for her was paradoxically matched by an surging admiration for Egypt, which Octavian promptly absorbed into his empire. This fascination sparked an explosion of Egyptian-inspired art and architecture throughout the Roman capital.\n\nInto this complex aftermath stepped Cleopatra Selene, the ten-year-old daughter of Antony and Cleopatra. Orphaned, she and her brothers were taken to Rome, ostensibly cared for by Octavian's sister, Octavia. However, this was a shrewd political move to neutralize any lingering threat from the Ptolemaic line. Selene was publicly paraded in Octavian's triple triumph, dressed as the moon—a poignant symbol of her celestial name and conquered heritage—marching alongside an effigy of her mother. Mercifully, she was spared the ritual execution typically meted out to defeated enemies.\n\nUnlike her half-siblings, who readily assimilated, Selene's past as a declared queen of Crete and Cyrenaica made her integration into Roman society unique. A pragmatic solution emerged in her marriage to Gaius Julius Juba, another exiled royal. Around 25 BC, they were dispatched to rule Mauretania, Rome's vast and resource-rich client kingdom in North Africa. Here, Selene thrived as a visible and active queen, a role she had witnessed her own mother embody. Far from being a passive consort, she asserted her prestigious Ptolemaic lineage, co-ruling as Juba's equal partner. Their joint coinage proudly displayed both their portraits and titles, while Selene even issued her own coins featuring crescent moons, Egyptian motifs, and boldly proclaiming herself \"Queen Cleopatra, daughter of Queen Cleopatra,\" a powerful testament to her pride in her mother.\n\nTheir capital, Caesarea (renamed in Octavian's honor), became a sophisticated multicultural court, deeply inspired by Alexandria. They embarked on an ambitious building program, creating a lighthouse akin to the famous Pharos, renovating temples for Egyptian gods, and importing Egyptian art. Selene's vivid memories of her homeland enriched Juba's own writings, allowing her to subtly reintroduce Egyptian culture within a Roman-approved framework.\n\nTragically, Selene died prematurely around the turn of the first millennium, possibly during a lunar eclipse. Despite her enduring influence—her coinage remained in circulation for decades—her historical legacy is surprisingly muted. Roman historians, primarily focused on events in the imperial core, rarely documented client kingdoms unless they posed a problem. Cleopatra Selene's success in establishing a stable and prosperous reign in Mauretania meant she \"succeeded quietly,\" ensuring her relative obscurity compared to her more famously \"failed loudly\" mother—a paradox captured by the adage: \"Well-behaved women rarely make history.\"",

        "content": "According to the ancient Egyptians, the entire universe was made up of masculine and feminine elements, maintained in a state of perfect balance by the goddess Maat. Her numerous fellow deities included a male earth god and female sky goddess. While the green-hued Geb lay back, his star-spangled sister Nut stretched herself high above to form the expanse of sky, hold back the forces of chaos, and give birth to the sun each dawn. Ad Nut was the mother of twin deities Isis and Osiris. Isis was the active partner to her passive brother Osiris, whom she raised from the dead to conceive their child, Horus. Isis was also regarded as  more powerful than a thousand soldiers . This same blend of nurturer and destroyer was shared with Hathor, goddess of love and beauty, capable of transforming into Sekhmet, a deity so fierce that male pharaohs were said to  rage like a Sekhmet  against enemies in battle.  about 8 ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses you might not know Such mixing of the sexes was not confined to myth, since Egypt s women were portrayed alongside men at every level of society. This no doubt explains why the Greek historian Herodotus was forced to conclude that the Egyptians  have reversed the ordinary practices of mankind  when visiting Egypt around 450 BC. So while the most common female title in Egypt s 3,000-year history was  lady of the house  (housewife), many women worked in the temple hierarchy. Other women were overseers and administrators, or they held titles ranging from doctor, guard and judge to treasurer, vizier (prime minister) and viceroy. And some women were also monarchs, from the regents who ruled on behalf of underage sons to those who governed in their own right as pharaoh, a term simply meaning  the one from the palace . Yet some Egyptologists still downgrade female rulers by defining them by the relatively modern term  queen , which can simply refer to a woman married to a male king. And while the c15th-century BC Hatshepsut ruled as a pharaoh in her own right, she is still often regarded as the exception that proves the rule   even though the evidence suggests there were at the very least seven female pharaohs, including Nefertiti and the great Cleopatra. These well-known names were simply drawing on female predecessors dating back to the beginning of Egypt s written history and the first such ruler, Merneith (whose reign is dated to around 2970 BC). When her tomb was discovered, at Abydos in 1900, it was claimed that  it can hardly be doubted that Merneith was a king , until the realisation that  he  was a  she  saw her status switched to  queen . Her name nonetheless appeared on a list of Egypt s earliest kings which was discovered in 1986. The evidence for female rulers is as fragmentary as it is for many male counterparts   with few known dates of birth or death, and no known portraits for many. Yet, only the women s titles are routinely downgraded or dismissed, even when the evidence reveals that some, like those profiled on these pages, did rule Egypt as pharaoh. Khentkawes I: The mother of Egypt Title Mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, [holding office as] King of Upper and Lower Egypt Born c2550 2520 BC, possibly at the royal capital Memphis Died c2510 2490 BC One woman whose status has long been debated is Khentkawes I. She was the daughter of King Menkaure, and the wife of King Shepseskaf (ruled c2510 2502 BC), and bore at least two further kings   with new evidence supporting the possibility that she herself also ruled Egypt. Khentkawes I s funerary complex was as elaborate as the nearby pyramids of her male predecessors   so elaborate, in fact, that her tomb has been dubbed the Fourth Pyramid of Giza. It had its own funerary temple, a causeway and, says Ana Tavares, joint field director of the current excavations at her Giza tomb site,  quite exceptionally, a valley temple and a basin/harbour, which suggests that she reigned as a pharaoh at the end of the fourth dynasty . In fact Khentkawes I s kingly status was suggested as early as 1933 by Egyptian archaeologist Selim Hassan during his initial excavation of her tomb. For here she was portrayed enthroned, holding a sceptre and wearing both the royal  uraeus  cobra at her brow and tie-on false beard of kingship combined with her traditional female dress. The tomb also revealed Khentkawes I s official titles in a hieroglyphic inscription, initially translated as  King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt  until British Egyptologist Alan Gardiner found a  philologically tenable  alternative translation meaning that Khentkawes I had only been  the mother of two kings  rather than a king herself. Yet in light of the new archaeological evidence, her ambiguous title is now interpreted as  Mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, [holding office as] King of Upper and Lower Egypt . Khentkawes I certainly left her mark at Giza, where memories that a female ruler had built a great tomb persisted for two millennia. Yet she was by no means unique, for within a couple of decades her descendant Khentkawes II held the same titles, was again portrayed with the royal cobra at her brow, and had her own pyramid at the new royal cemetery, Abusir. There was even a third such woman whose pyramid complex at Sakkara was so large some Egyptologists have suggested she had  an independent reign  at the death of her husband, King Djedkare, in c2375 BC. But this mystery ruler remains anonymous and forgotten, for not only was her name erased from her tomb complex after her death, the 1950s excavation of her tomb was never published and it remains the Pyramid of the Unknown Queen. Sobeknefru: The crocodile queen Title King of Upper and Lower Egypt Born c1830 1815 BC, possibly Hawara in the Fayum Died c1785 BC Despite evidence that some women held kingly powers during the third millennium BC, the first universally accepted female pharaoh is Sobeknefru. Daughter of Amenemhat III, who she succeeded in c1789 BC to rule for approximately four years, Sobeknefru appeared on official king lists for centuries after her death. The first monarch named after crocodile god Sobek, symbol of pharaonic might, Sobeknefru took the standard five royal names of a king   Merytre Satsekhem-nebettawy Djedetkha Sobekkare Sobeknefru   with the epithet Son of Ra (the sun god) amended to Daughter of Ra. Her portraits blended male and female attributes, the striped royal headcloth and male-style kilt worn over female dress. Sobeknefru is also depicted in the cloak associated with her coronation. Yet a more complete portrait was identified as Sobeknefru in 1993, and it s in this that the strong family resemblance to her father, Amenemhat III, can be seen. Sobeknefru created temples at the northern sites Tell Dab a and Herakleopolis, and also completed her father s pyramid complex at Hawara. She seems to have built her own pyramid at Mazghuna near Dahshur, but no trace of her burial has been found. If she is mentioned at all in modern histories, it is only to be dismissed as the last resort of an otherwise male dynasty. Yet the throne passed smoothly to a succession of male kings who followed her lead by naming themselves after the crocodile god. Her innovations inspired the next female pharaoh Hatshepsut (ruled c1479 1458 BC), who adopted the same kingly regalia and false beard. The modern tendency to cast Hatshepsut as a cross-dresser is only possible because her female forerunners have been played down or ignored. Such is the case with Nefertiti. She is judged almost entirely on her beautiful bust, yet evidence suggests she wielded the same kingly powers as her husband and may have succeeded him as sole ruler. Her example was followed by the 12th-century BC female pharaoh Tawosret, whose titles included Strong Bull and Daughter of Ra. She was the last female pharaoh for almost a thousand years, the final millennium BC being marked by successive foreign invasions of Egypt. The most successful of these were the Macedonian Ptolemies, claiming descent from Alexander the Great and ruling for the last three centuries BC. Their Egyptian advisor Manetho created the system of royal dynasties we still use today. He named five of the female pharaohs, stating that  it was decided that women might hold the kingly office  as early as the second dynasty, in the early third millennium BC. Arsinoe II: The queen and female king Titles Queen of Macedonia (& Thrace), King of Upper and Lower Egypt Born c316 BC, most likely at Memphis Died Probably 16 or 17 July 268 BC The legacy of Egypt s female pharaohs certainly inspired Arsinoe II. Married to two successive kings of Macedonia, Arsinoe II then returned to her Egyptian homeland and the court of her younger brother Ptolemy II, marrying him to become queen for a third time. Yet she also became his full co-ruler, with the same combination of names as a traditional pharaoh. This statue of Arsinoe II identified her with the goddess Isis   thanks, in part, to the so-called  Isis knot  on her right shoulder   so exploiting Egyptian tradition to strengthen her image (Image by Getty) Although these titles were long assumed to have been awarded posthumously, recent research has revealed that Arsinoe II was acknowledged as King of Upper and Lower Egypt during her own lifetime. Like Hatshepsut over a thousand years earlier, Arsinoe became Daughter of Ra and adopted the same distinctive regalia to demonstrate continuity with past practice. Further exploiting Egyptian tradition, Arsinoe was likened to the goddess Isis, twinned with her laid-back brother-husband Osiris. As married siblings, Arsinoe and Ptolemy were equated with classical deities Zeus and Hera for their Greek subjects. Joint portraits of Arsinoe and Ptolemy highlighted the family resemblance to putative uncle Alexander, whose mummified body, entombed in their royal capital Alexandria, was further evidence of their divinely inspired dynasty. This too was a relationship Arsinoe exploited to the full, from her subtle adoption of Alexander s trademark ram s horns to staring eyes so large some medical historians claim she must have suffered from exophthalmic goitre, a disease that often affects the thyroid. Arsinoe II certainly used her multi-faceted public image to great effect in her political dealings, when she and Ptolemy II became the first of Alexander s successors to make official contact with Rome in 273 BC. Then, when Egypt joined Athens and Sparta against Macedonia in the Chremonidean War, Arsinoe s lead role was acknowledged in an Athenian decree stating that Ptolemy II was  following the policies of his ancestors and his sister . Athens also honoured the couple with statuary, as did Olympia, where Arsinoe achieved great success in the Olympic Games of 272 BC when her teams won victories in all three chariot races on a single day. Most of Arsinoe s images were in Egypt, where, according to inscriptions set up in the temple at Mendes, it was decreed that  her statue be set up in all the temples. This pleased their priests for they were aware of her noble attitude toward the gods and of her excellent deeds to the benefit of all people.  In Egypt s new capital, Alexandria, Arsinoe s influence was even stronger. Continuing Ptolemaic tradition by spending vast sums on the Great Library and Museum, she personally financed spectacular public festivals with which to impress her subjects, even if fragments of a lost biography reveal her sneering at the  very dirty get-together  of the crowds as they celebrated in the streets beyond her lavish palace. Dazzling legacy Having transformed the Ptolemaic house into a dazzling bastion of conspicuous consumption, 48-year-old Arsinoe died in July 268 BC and was cremated in a Macedonian-style ceremony. Her memory was kept alive at the annual  Arsinoeia  festival, and in the renaming of streets, towns, cities and entire regions in her honour, both in Egypt and around the Mediterranean. Her spiritual presence was so strong that for the next 22 years of Ptolemy II s reign, he never remarried and continued to appear with his deceased wife in official portraits, naming her on official documents and issuing her coinage. As the first Ptolemaic woman to rule as a female king, Arsinoe s achievements were then replicated by the women of her dynasty, the last of whom was Cleopatra the Great. Cleopatra was the final, and of course most famous, culmination of three millennia of Egypt s female pharaohs.

        "target_summary": "Ancient Egypt’s worldview was a vibrant tapestry woven from masculine and feminine energies, exquisitely balanced by the goddess Maat. This divine equilibrium was mirrored in their pantheon, where the star-spangled sky goddess Nut arched gracefully over the recumbent earth god Geb, giving birth to the sun each dawn. Powerful goddesses like Isis, a formidable nurturer capable of raising the dead, and Hathor, who could transform into the fierce warrior Sekhmet, embodied both life-giving and destructive forces, showcasing a profound respect for female agency from the cosmos down.\n\nThis mythical reverence for female power profoundly shaped Egyptian society, famously leading the Greek historian Herodotus to note their \"reversed practices.\" Beyond the domestic sphere, Egyptian women held diverse and influential positions, from temple hierarchies and administrative roles to doctors, judges, and even high-ranking viziers. Yet, modern Egyptology often diminishes the authority of female monarchs, preferring the term \"queen\" over \"pharaoh\" (meaning \"one from the palace\"). This bias obscures a rich history of powerful female rulers, from the foundational Merneith, whose kingly status was initially recognized before her gender became an \"issue,\" to later, more widely known figures like Nefertiti and Cleopatra.\n\nOne such figure, Khentkawes I, born around 2550 BC, stands as a testament to this overlooked legacy. Her elaborate funerary complex, dubbed the \"Fourth Pyramid of Giza,\" rivaled those of male pharaohs, complete with its own valley temple and harbor. Crucially, Khentkawes I was depicted enthroned, adorned with the royal uraeus and false beard of kingship, blended with traditional female dress. Her hieroglyphic titles, initially misinterpreted, are now re-evaluated to confirm her role as \"King of Upper and Lower Egypt,\" challenging centuries of scholarly downplaying. Her indelible mark at Giza, and that of her descendant Khentkawes II, hints at a deeper, more pervasive tradition of female rule.\n\nThe first universally accepted female pharaoh, Sobeknefru, emerged around 1789 BC. As the daughter and successor of Amenemhat III, she reigned for approximately four years, her name etched onto official king lists for centuries. Adopting the full array of five royal names, she boldly styled herself \"Daughter of Ra\" and presented a powerful image that seamlessly blended male and female attributes in her royal portraits, wearing the striped headcloth and kilt over female attire. Her innovations laid the groundwork for future female pharaohs like Hatshepsut, whose own regalia directly echoed Sobeknefru's pioneering choices.\n\nCenturies later, the Ptolemaic dynasty further cemented the tradition of female leadership, inspired by Manetho's acknowledgement that women could indeed hold \"kingly office.\" Arsinoe II, born around 316 BC, stands as a dazzling embodiment of this legacy. Returning to her homeland, she married her brother Ptolemy II and became his full co-ruler, recognized during her lifetime as \"King of Upper and Lower Egypt.\" Like her ancient predecessors, Arsinoe embraced traditional pharaonic titles, identifying with the goddess Isis and even adopting Alexander the Great's trademark ram's horns, crafting a formidable public image. Her political acumen was matched by her Olympic triumphs, and her influence was so profound that upon her death, Ptolemy II honored her memory for decades, never remarrying and issuing coinage in her name.\n\nArsinoe's achievements profoundly influenced the women of her dynasty, culminating in the iconic Cleopatra the Great. From the mythical goddesses balancing the cosmos to formidable pharaohs who shaped their empires, ancient Egypt maintained a unique and often powerful space for women, a legacy that, despite historical attempts to diminish it, truly redefined the \"ordinary practices of mankind.\"",

        "title": "Actium, 31 BC: the beginning of the end for Mark Antony and Cleopatra",
        "content": "Mark Antony s campaign to become sole ruler of Rome was crumbling. By the summer of 31 BC, his fleet was trapped in the Ambracian Gulf, on the west coast of Greece, by the ships of his enemy Octavian. Ad He was chronically short of men, and the spot where his army was camped was a mosquito-infested marsh near Actium, on the south shore of the gulf. Their every move was being watched by Octavian s men from the high ground on the opposite shore. Supplies were running out, malaria and dysentery were decimating his army, and the oarsmen who powered his ships were starting to desert. Antony had to make a move, and soon   if he didn t, before long he d have no forces with which to fight. The Battle of Actium was the climax of 13 years of civil wars. Sparked by the assassination of Julius Caesar, they had torn the Roman world apart. Julius Caesar s heir, Octavian, and his former right-hand man, Antony, had been two-thirds of the triumvirate, which, in 42 BC, brought down Caesar s murderers. But once that common enemy had been tackled, their fragile alliance began to fracture and the two became bitter enemies. Octavian s power base was in the western part of the Roman territories, while Antony controlled the eastern part   with the aid of his lover, Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. That relationship gave Antony access to the riches of Egypt but it also scandalised Rome, a situation exacerbated by the fact that Antony had abandoned his Roman wife   who, significantly, was also Octavian s sister. Octavian s propaganda machine was soon hard at work, portraying the struggle not as one between him and Antony but as a war between virtuous Rome and decadent Egypt. What happened at the Battle of Actium? Who | Octavian and Agrippa (400 ship) versus Mark Antony and Cleopatra (500 ships, reduced to 230) When | 2 September 31 BC Where | Ionian Sea near Actium, off the west coast of Greece Why | Antony and Cleopatra were attempting to break through Octavian s naval blockade Outcome | Victory for Octavian. Antony and Cleopatra escaped with their treasure but lost most of their ships In 32 BC, Antony and Cleopatra relocated their forces to the Ambracian Gulf. With a powerful navy numbering some 500 ships, they probably hoped to lure Octavian and his forces into Greece, before destroying his fleet in a pitched battle, thus cutting his supply lines. If so, the ploy worked. Octavian crossed into Greece with a large army. Disastrously for Antony, however, sickness ravaged his forces. Much of his land army was unfit for battle, and he could muster crews for barely half his fleet. Meanwhile, Octavian s loyal general Marcus Agrippa led his own fleet along the coast, capturing key bases. Soon it was Antony and Cleopatra who found themselves cut off near Actium. Antony made a foray to outflank Octavian s army by marching round the Ambracian Gulf, but his efforts came to nothing. He was left with no choice but to abandon Greece, loading up his treasure, embarking as many of his soldiers onto his ships as he could and attempting to break through Octavian s naval blockade. He would then, he hoped, pick up the prevailing wind, sail round the Peloponnese and make for Egypt. Ordering the rest of his army north to Macedonia, Antony readied his fleet   burning many ships for which he no longer had crews   and waited for the weather, which had been stormy for some days, to improve. On 2 September his chance came. At about noon, he moved his ships out of the gulf and into the open sea   where Octavian and Agrippa waited for them, backing up to give themselves enough room to manoeuvre. Who fought at the Battle of Actium? Gaius Julius Octavius (Octavian) Julius Caesar s great-nephew, named by Caesar as his adopted son and heir; later known as Augustus. The two couldn t have been more different: Caesar was bold, impetuous and an inspiring leader, whereas Octavian was careful, methodical and an effective delegator. Festina Lente ( Make haste slowly ) was his motto. He was no great general, but his old friend Marcus Agrippa was an able soldier, and commanded his forces. Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony) A key supporter of Julius Caesar, he helped the great general in his conquest of Gaul. Antony was a born soldier but a rather naive politician. There s no doubt he fell under Cleopatra s spell, but his romantic interest in the Queen was probably heightened by her great wealth and the resources available to her. Cleopatra VII A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a family of Greek origin who had ruled Egypt for nearly 300 years, Cleopatra infamously had love affairs with both Julius Caesar and then Antony. Indeed, she bore them both children. Though Octavian s PR machine portrayed her as a decadent oriental seductress and the implacable enemy of Rome, Cleopatra s main priority was to ensure the survival of her dynasty and the independence of Egypt. What was Antony and Cleopatra's plan? As the sweating oarsmen below decks hauled away, the two fleets began to close in on each other. Up on deck, archers drew their bows and those manning the ballistae (huge crossbows) stood ready to shoot; waiting soldiers gripped their weapons and offered silent prayers that they might not become the victims of enemy missiles. The ships  prows were fitted with rams, but by this era ramming was a comparatively rare occurrence. Instead, helmsmen tried to manoeuvre their vessels into an advantageous position while soldiers rained arrows, javelins and ballista bolts into the ranks of their enemies, while waiting for an opportunity to board the opponent s vessels. Antony was drastically outnumbered. His fleet, reduced by his own hand, now numbered 230 ships compared with Octavian s 400. True, many of his vessels were quinqueremes, formidable warships powered by hundreds of oarsmen and sporting high wooden towers packed with archers. But such ships were slow, and Octavian s advantage in numbers soon began to tell. As the navies clashed and hand-to-hand fighting surged across the decks, some of Octavian s ships began to work their way around the flanks of Antony s smaller fleet. To counter this, and to avoid being completely encircled, Antony s own ships edged sideways as well   creating a gap in the very centre of the line of battle. One account says that, when Mark Antony's men ran out of water to put out the fires, they tried to smother the flames with the bodies of their dead comrades Cleopatra made her move. The galleys under her command had been waiting in reserve, guarding transport ships laden with treasure. Now, she ordered them to hoist their sails and make straight for the gap, quickly escaping from the gulf and getting clean away. Antony followed in hot pursuit. Abandoning his flagship for a smaller, lighter craft, he sailed after his lover, followed by a handful of galleys that escaped the fighting. Octavian s ships gave chase, and the men on Antony s fleeing vessels frantically tried to make them lighter and faster. Towers, catapults, weapons and nonessential equipment were all hastily dumped into the sea; anything that might slow them down was thrown overboard in a desperate bid to enable the ships to outrun their pursuers. Who won the Battle of Actium? Eventually, Octavian s fleet gave up the chase. Their leader would later claim that Cleopatra had sailed off in a panic, and that Antony had abandoned his comrades in order to slavishly follow his lover. In fact, it seems far more likely that this had been a pre-planned gambit, employed to rescue Antony s treasure and escape with as many ships as possible. Antony s wealth was safe   but most of his fleet, left behind at the gulf, had been abandoned to its fate. Anxious to preserve these ships and their crews for his own use, Octavian sailed from vessel to vessel, shouting that Antony had fled and pointing out the futility of further resistance. Not all of Antony s crews were convinced. As Octavian s men approached, expecting to board the defeated ships and accept their surrender, they found themselves driven back by a barrage of missiles. Unwilling to risk their lives now that the victory had been won, Octavian s men resorted to incineration. They circled Antony s doomed ships, bombarding them with flaming javelins and burning arrows. Fanned by a stiff breeze, fires quickly spread through the wooden vessels   but even then, with their ships ablaze, some of Antony s men refused to surrender. One account says that, when they ran out of water to put out the fires, they tried to smother the flames with the bodies of their dead comrades. But at when the weather took a turn for the worse and, faced with the risk of capsizing and drowning as well as burning alive, the survivors finally gave up the fight. Antony s mighty fleet had been all but destroyed. What happened after the Actium? When news of the battle reached Antony s eastern allies, most of them abandoned him, while the army he d sent to Macedonia also defected. He retreated with some 60 ships to the fragile safety of Alexandria in Egypt. But the following summer, Octavian invaded. Deserted by his allies and his surviving troops, Antony committed suicide. Egypt was swallowed up by Octavian s empire and, unwilling to face the humiliation of being paraded through Rome in Octavian s triumphal procession, Cleopatra also killed herself. Octavian, now undisputed master of the Roman world, introduced a series of reforms that gave him control over all aspects of government. Abolishing the old republic, he declared himself emperor for life. Taking the name Augustus, which means lofty or serene, he ruled for over 40 years, until his death in AD 14.

His fleet lay ensnared in Greece's Ambracian Gulf by the ships of his rival, Octavian, while his army, ravaged by malaria and dysentery, festered in a mosquito-infested marsh near Actium. Chronically short of men and supplies, every move watched by the enemy, Antony faced an increasingly desperate situation. This precarious standoff was the climax of 13 years of brutal civil wars, ignited by Julius Caesar's assassination. Once allies, Octavian, Caesar's heir, and Antony, his former right-hand man, had become bitter enemies after their fragile triumvirate fractured. Octavian consolidated power in the Roman West, while Antony controlled the East, aided by the captivating Queen Cleopatra of Egypt. This scandalous alliance, cemented by Antony abandoning Octavian's sister, fueled Octavian's shrewd propaganda machine, which relentlessly painted the conflict as virtuous Rome against decadent Egypt.\n\nAntony and Cleopatra had initially hoped to lure Octavian into Greece and destroy his superior fleet. Though Octavian crossed, Antony's forces were decimated by disease, rendering much of his army unfit and leaving him with crews for barely half his ships. Meanwhile, Octavian's general, Marcus Agrippa, skillfully captured key bases, effectively trapping Antony and Cleopatra near Actium. With no other option, Antony planned a desperate break through the blockade, hoping to salvage his treasure and what remained of his forces, then sail to Egypt. He burned many ships for lack of crews and waited for stormy weather to abate.\n\nOn September 2, 31 BC, Antony's vastly outnumbered fleet, now reduced to 230 ships—many of them slow but formidable quinqueremes—moved into the open Ionian Sea. Octavian's 400 swifter ships, commanded by Agrippa, awaited them. The two navies clashed in a furious engagement, a maelstrom of arrows, javelins, and ballista bolts. As Octavian's numerical superiority allowed his ships to encircle Antony's flanks, Antony's fleet shifted, inadvertently creating a crucial gap in the battle line. It was then that Cleopatra's galleys, laden with vital treasure and previously held in reserve, seized the moment. Hoisting sails, they sped through the opening and escaped the gulf. Antony, abandoning his flagship for a swifter vessel, frantically pursued his lover, a handful of galleys following in their desperate bid to lighten ships by dumping towers, catapults, and weapons into the sea.\n\nOctavian's fleet eventually abandoned the chase. While Octavian later spun the escape as Cleopatra's panic and Antony's slavish devotion, it was likely a pre-planned gambit to preserve his wealth. Left behind, most of Antony's mighty fleet became Octavian's prize. Though Octavian offered quarter, many of Antony's loyal crews fiercely resisted, enduring barrages of flaming javelins and arrows. Some, running out of water, desperately tried to smother fires with the bodies of their fallen comrades. Only worsening weather and the threat of drowning, in addition to burning alive, finally forced their surrender.

He retreated to Alexandria with a mere 60 ships, but the following summer, Octavian invaded. Deserted and defeated, Antony committed suicide.

        "content": "Ad They did not ride camels The camel was not used regularly in Egypt until the very end of the dynastic age. Instead, the Egyptians used donkeys as beasts of burden, and boats as a highly convenient means of transport. The River Nile flowed through the centre of their fertile land, creating a natural highway (and sewer!). The current helped those who needed to row from south to north, while the wind made life easy for those who wished to sail in the opposite direction. The river was linked to settlements, quarries and building sites by canals. Huge wooden barges were used to transport grain and heavy stone blocks; light papyrus boats ferried people about their daily business. And every day, high above the river, the sun god Ra was believed to sail across the sky in his solar boat. Not everyone was mummified The mummy   an eviscerated, dried and bandaged corpse   has become a defining Egyptian artefact. Yet mummification was an expensive and time-consuming process, reserved for the more wealthy members of society. The vast majority of Egypt s dead were buried in simple pits in the desert. So why did the elite feel the need to mummify their dead? They believed that it was possible to live again after death, but only if the body retained a recognisable human form. Ironically, this could have been achieved quite easily by burying the dead in direct contact with the hot and sterile desert sand; a natural desiccation would then have occurred. But the elite wanted to be buried in coffins within tombs, and this meant that their corpses, no longer in direct contact with the sand, started to rot. The twin requirements of elaborate burial equipment plus a recognisable body led to the science of artificial mummification. The living shared food with the dead The tomb was designed as an eternal home for the mummified body and the ka spirit that lived beside it. An accessible tomb-chapel allowed families, well-wishers and priests to visit the deceased and leave the regular offerings that the ka required, while a hidden burial chamber protected the mummy from harm. Within the tomb-chapel, food and drink were offered on a regular basis. Having been spiritually consumed by the ka, they were then physically consumed by the living. During the  feast of the valley , an annual festival of death and renewal, many families spent the night in the tomb-chapels of their ancestors. The hours of darkness were spent drinking and feasting by torchlight as the living celebrated their reunion with the dead. Food offerings to the dead.

This meant that women could own, earn, buy, sell and inherit property. They could live unprotected by male guardians and, if widowed or divorced, could raise their own children. They could bring cases before, and be punished by, the law courts. And they were expected to deputise for an absent husband in matters of business. Men and women were treated as equals in ancient Egypt. (Photo by Lizzie Shepherd/Robert Harding via Getty Images) Everyone in ancient Egypt was expected to marry, with husbands and wives being allocated complementary but opposite roles within the marriage. The wife, the  mistress of the house , was responsible for all internal, domestic matters. She raised the children and ran the household while her husband, the dominant partner in the marriage, played the external, wage-earning role. Scribes rarely wrote in hieroglyphs Hieroglyphic writing - a script consisting of many hundreds of intricate images   was beautiful to look at, but time-consuming to create. It was therefore reserved for the most important texts; the writings decorating tomb and temple walls, and texts recording royal achievements. As they went about their daily business, Egypt s scribes routinely used hieratic   a simplified or shorthand form of hieroglyphic writing. Towards the end of the dynastic period they used demotic, an even more simplified version of hieratic. All three scripts were used to write the same ancient Egyptian language. Few of the ancients would have been able to read either hieroglyphs or hieratic: it is estimated that no more than 10 per cent (and perhaps considerably less) of the population was literate. Egyptian hieroglyphics were reserved for the most important texts; the writings decorating tomb and temple walls, and texts recording royal achievements.

But this was not always possible, and the coronation ceremony had the power to convert the most unlikely candidate into an unassailable king. On at least three occasions women took the throne, ruling in their own right as female kings and using the full king s titulary. The most successful of these female rulers, Hatshepsut, ruled Egypt for more than 20 prosperous years. In the English language, where  king  is gender-specific, we might classify Sobeknefru, Hatshepsut and Tausret as queens regnant. In Egyptian, however, the phrase that we conventionally translate as  queen  literally means  king s wife , and is entirely inappropriate for these women. Few Egyptian men married their sisters Some of Egypt s kings married their sisters or half-sisters. These incestuous marriages ensured that the queen was trained in her duties from birth, and that she remained entirely loyal to her husband and their children. They provided appropriate husbands for princesses who might otherwise remain unwed, while restricting the number of potential claimants for the throne. They even provided a link with the gods, several of whom (like Isis and Osiris) enjoyed incestuous unions. However, brother-sister marriages were never compulsory, and some of Egypt s most prominent queens   including Nefertiti   were of non-royal birth. Incestuous marriages were not common outside the royal family until the very end of the dynastic age. The restricted Egyptian kingship terminology ( father ,  mother ,  brother ,  sister ,  son  and  daughter  being the only terms used), and the tendency to apply these words loosely so that  sister  could with equal validity describe an actual sister, a wife or a lover, has led to a lot of confusion over this issue.

Explore her incredible life, her quest her for power and her untimely end. Not all pharaohs built pyramids Almost all the pharaohs of the Old Kingdom (c2686 2125 BC) and Middle Kingdom (c2055 1650 BC) built pyramid-tombs in Egypt s northern deserts. These highly conspicuous monuments linked the kings with the sun god Ra while replicating the mound of creation that emerged from the waters of chaos at the beginning of time. But by the start of the New Kingdom (c1550 BC) pyramid building was out of fashion. Kings would now build two entirely separate funerary monuments. Their mummies would be buried in hidden rock-cut tombs in the Valley of the Kings on the west bank of the Nile at the southern city of Thebes, while a highly visible memorial temple, situated on the border between the cultivated land (home of the living), and the sterile desert (home of the dead), would serve as the focus of the royal mortuary cult. Following the collapse of the New Kingdom, subsequent kings were buried in tombs in northern Egypt: some of their burials have never been discovered. The Great Pyramid was not built by slaves The classical historian Herodotus believed that the Great Pyramid had been built by 100,000 slaves. His image of men, women and children desperately toiling in the harshest of conditions has proved remarkably popular with modern film producers. It is, however, wrong. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Great Pyramid was in fact built by a workforce of 5,000 permanent, salaried employees and up to 20,000 temporary workers. These workers were free men, summoned under the corv e system of national service to put in a three- or four-month shift on the building site before returning home. They were housed in a temporary camp near the pyramid, where they received payment in the form of food, drink, medical attention and, for those who died on duty, burial in the nearby cemetery.

Surely, then, she must have been an outstanding beauty? Her coins suggest that this was probably not the case. All show her in profile with a prominent nose, pronounced chin and deep-set eyes. Of course, Cleopatra s coins reflect the skills of their makers, and it is entirely possible that the queen did not want to appear too feminine on the tokens that represented her sovereignty within and outside Egypt. Unfortunately we have no eyewitness description of the queen. However the classical historian Plutarch   who never actually met Cleopatra   tells us that her charm lay in her demeanour, and in her beautiful voice.

        "target_summary": "Ancient Egypt, often imagined through certain iconic images, reveals a more complex reality when explored in depth. Contrary to popular belief, camels were not a regular sight until the dynastic age's end; instead, the mighty Nile served as the empire's central artery, with donkeys bearing burdens on land. Boats, from huge wooden barges transporting grain and stone to light papyrus vessels ferrying people, provided essential transport, reflecting the reverence for the river that even inspired the sun god Ra's celestial journey.\n\nDeath rituals, while famed for mummification, were largely exclusive. This intricate and costly process was reserved for the wealthy elite, who believed it essential for the *ka* spirit's afterlife to preserve a recognizable body. The vast majority of Egyptians found simpler burials in the desert, where natural desiccation often preserved remains. Yet, for all, the living maintained a profound connection with the deceased, sharing regular food and drink offerings in tomb-chapels, culminating in vibrant annual feasts that reunited families with their ancestors.\n\nSocietal structures also held surprising progressive elements. Ancient Egyptian women, remarkably, enjoyed equal rights with men of equivalent social standing before the law. They could own property, earn income, conduct business, and raise children independently if widowed or divorced, though marriage roles were distinctly complementary: the wife as \"mistress of the house\" overseeing domestic affairs, and the husband as the external provider.\n\nThe written word, too, held dual forms. While beautiful hieroglyphs adorned sacred spaces like temples and royal tombs, reflecting significant achievements, daily administrative and literary tasks were handled by scribes using simpler, shorthand scripts like hieratic and later demotic, highlighting that full literacy was a rare privilege.\n\nEven kingship defied straightforward categorization. Though ideally passed from father to son, the throne was occasionally occupied by powerful women, such as Hatshepsut, who ruled as full kings, challenging modern gendered titles. Royal marriages sometimes involved siblings to consolidate power and loyalty, though this practice was neither compulsory nor widespread beyond the royal family.\n\nFinally, many grand symbols of Egypt hold unexpected truths. Not all pharaohs built pyramids; later New Kingdom rulers opted for hidden rock-cut tombs in the Valley of the Kings and visible memorial temples. And the awe-inspiring Great Pyramid, far from being the product of enslaved masses as popularized by later historians, was built by a well-organized, salaried workforce of free citizens performing national service, a testament to ancient Egyptian logistical brilliance. Even the legendary Cleopatra, famed for captivating Rome's most powerful men, may have entranced through her intellect, charm, and beautiful voice rather than conventional beauty, as suggested by her coinage and historical accounts.",

Her passing marked the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which had ruled Egypt since 305/304 BC, following the collapse of the empire established by Alexander the Great. It also enabled Octavian, who in 27 BC would become Augustus, the first Roman emperor, to get his hands on her lands. Ad Cleopatra had a history of staking the fortunes of her nation on Roman men. Firstly, she plumped for Julius Caesar and then, following his assassination, his staunch supporter Mark Antony. A third, however, would prove to be beyond even her legendary powers of persuasion.  | How many Cleopatras ruled Ancient Egypt? Together, Antony and Cleopatra tried to block Octavian s path to power, combining their armies in a bid to defeat him. The conflict reached a climax at the legendary battle of Actium in Greece   a ferocious encounter that did not go well for the Queen of Egypt and her Roman general, and they were forced to flee back to Egypt. After Egypt was annexed by Octavian, it was renamed Aegyptus and became   thanks to its prodigious grain production   a key contributor to the Roman economy. The port of Alexandria grew to be the empire's second-largest city. With Octavian s troops marching towards Alexandria, Antony rejoined the battle. Cleopatra, meanwhile, hid herself away in her mausoleum, along with her treasure and two maidservants. Antony picked up information that Cleopatra was dead. Devastated, he fell upon his sword, saying, according to Ancient Greek biographer Plutarch:  I am not pained to be bereft of you, for at once I will be where you are, but it does pain me that I, as a commander, am revealed to be inferior to a woman in courage.  How did Cleopatra die? Antony then received word that Cleopatra was still alive. Fatally wounded, he was taken to her. The queen was distraught but, before he succumbed to death, Antony asked her to make peace with Octavian. Octavian, however, wasn t doing any deals. He wanted Cleopatra as a trophy to parade in Rome but, rather than submit, she too died by suicide. Legend has it she did this by encouraging a snake to bite her, although her two handmaidens died at the same time, suggesting that some other form of poisoning saw her off. While Cleopatra s demise might have taken the edge off of Octavian s victory parade, he was greeted back in Rome as the conquering hero. He now had absolute power over the richest kingdom along the Mediterranean Sea. Egypt had become a mere province for Rome, one of the largest, most powerful empires of the ancient world, to plunder. It would remain under Roman rule until the 7th century. Ad This content first appeared in the August 2017 edition of BBC History Revealed",

Her reign was defined by audacious political gambles, as she sought to secure her nation's future through alliances with towering Roman figures, notably Julius Caesar and, following his assassination, Mark Antony. This precarious balancing act ultimately collapsed with the inexorable rise of Octavian.\n\nTogether, Antony and Cleopatra boldly challenged Octavian's ascent, their combined forces clashing in the climactic naval showdown at Actium. Their devastating defeat compelled a desperate flight back to Egypt. As Octavian's victorious legions advanced on Alexandria, a final, poignant tragedy unfolded. Mark Antony, receiving mistaken reports of Cleopatra's death, valiantly fell upon his sword in despair. Mortally wounded, he was carried to the queen's sanctuary, where, with his last breaths, he urged her to make peace. However, Cleopatra, fiercely resolute against the ultimate humiliation of a Roman triumphal parade, orchestrated her own final act, legendarily embracing a venomous asp alongside her loyal handmaidens. Her dramatic suicide, though momentarily dimming Octavian's triumphal glow, undeniably solidified his absolute power over Egypt. The transformed Roman province of Aegyptus, with its prodigious grain harvests and the bustling port of Alexandria, rapidly became a vital Roman breadbasket and economic hub, remaining under Roman rule for centuries.",

I had the privilege of working as a member of his team (on the first electronic telephone exchange, and later ERNIE) at the Post Office Research Station in Dollis Hill in the 1950s, when it was one of the leading research institutions in the world. However, he was a very senior figure in the organisation so my interaction with him was limited. I understood that he d done something remarkable during the war, but the Official Secrets Act was taken very seriously in those days, and the story of Colossus didn t really emerge until the 1970s. What kind of man was he? He was born in London s East End, the son of a bricklayer and the grandson of a charlady. Growing up, money was tight and he was taught to be frugal. While doing an engineering apprenticeship, he took evening classes, gained a degree in electrical engineering and went on to have a distinguished career. I always found him polite, unassuming, and never sexist. What made him a hero? Because he changed the course of history, not once but twice. First, with his Colossus computer, which decrypted a huge number of high-level German messages during the Second World War, part of work estimated to have curtailed the conflict by up to two years. Second, with his pioneering work on early computers that paved the way for the modern digital world. He was also inspirational to me personally, as the sort of manager I wanted to become: he listened to his staff, got quality work out of them and attracted great loyalty. He was the nearest thing to a mentor to me. What was his finest hour? Designing and building the Colossus computer at Bletchley Park in 1943 44. The Mark I Colossus processed information five times faster than Bletchley s previous code-breaking system. Tommy s Mark II Colossus, which began operation on 1 June 1944, decrypted a German message confirming that Hitler, believing that preparations for landings in Normandy were a feint, wanted no extra troops sent there. That helped convince Eisenhower to go ahead with the D-Day landings on 6 June. Can you see any parallels between his life and your own?

I was obsessed by ghosts from an early age. When I came across Price he was already something of a mythical figure, thanks to cases such as the Borley Rectory  hauntings  that loomed large in my childhood. What kind of man was he? He had a Walter Mitty quality: he was constantly fictionalising his life and pumping out fake versions of himself   partly, I think, because of his humble background [his father was a travelling salesman]. He lied about where he was born and grew up, and faked archaeological finds and  artefacts  that he d knocked up in his shed. What made Price a hero? I think one should use that word cautiously when talking about Harry, but, for all his flaws, he turned the paranormal into something mainstream and fun, and brought science to the study of the subject. He pretty much invented the concept of the  ghost-hunter , and much of what we associate with  the paranormal  has its roots in his work and the image he cultivated. He made psychic phenomena into news, and became a tabloid figure in what I think of as the golden age of ghost-hunting. Moreover, alongside Harry Houdini, he made it his mission to unmask fake mediums   the rock stars of the day, making huge money   as charlatans and tricksters. What was his finest hour? First, exposing fake mediums who preyed on people s grief. Second, his detective-style investigations into paranormal occurrences, in particular at the Borley Rectory   though plenty of people will tell you that Harry faked phenomena and dramatised events there. He was simultaneously a showman and a researcher, and sometimes the showman won out. Is there anything you don t particularly admire about him?

His most iconic case, the investigation of Borley Rectory – famously dubbed \"the most haunted house in England\" – cemented his legacy as a mythical figure in the public imagination, particularly for those captivated by the spectral. Price died at 67, leaving behind a complex legacy.\n\nYet, Price was a multifaceted individual, described as possessing a \"Walter Mitty quality.\" He meticulously crafted a public persona, often fictionalizing his own life, fabricating aspects of his humble background, and even creating fake archaeological artefacts from his shed. This penchant for embellishment, however, didn't entirely overshadow his significant contributions.\n\nPrice is widely credited with bringing the paranormal into the mainstream, infusing it with a sense of scientific inquiry and making it accessible and engaging. He virtually invented the concept of the modern \"ghost-hunter\" and cultivated an image that deeply influenced popular perceptions of the supernatural. Operating in what some call the \"golden age of ghost-hunting,\" he transformed psychic phenomena into headline news, becoming a celebrated tabloid personality. Alongside Harry Houdini, Price dedicated himself to unmasking the era's highly paid, often predatory, fake mediums, exposing them as charlatans who exploited public grief.\n\nHis finest achievements included safeguarding the vulnerable from these deceitful practitioners and conducting meticulous, detective-style investigations into ghostly occurrences, particularly at Borley. While acknowledged as both a showman and a serious researcher, critics suggest his theatrical flair sometimes overshadowed strict adherence to the truth, leading to accusations of dramatization or even fabrication in some of his findings.\n\nDespite his occasional \"duplicitousness\" and a somewhat liberal interpretation of the truth, Price's admirable qualities – his passion for demystifying the unknown and his role in making the study of the paranormal a public spectacle – are seen to outweigh his flaws. Interestingly, he was also a co-founder of what would become the British Film Institute. His enduring influence reminds contemporary researchers of the importance of listening to and attempting to understand personal accounts of ghostly encounters, even as the ethical balance between entertainment and empirical truth remains a pertinent question.",

He walked to Montserrat in Spain, climbed the mountain, lay down his sword and dagger at the Virgin s altar at the Benedictine monastery, and vowed to devote his life to rebuilding the church. He then went to live in a cave by the banks of the river Cardoner where he prayed and meditated. It was here that he went through a spiritual experience, changing him as a person, which enabled him to do all the good work he later did as a Jesuit.

Ad The BBC s King and Conqueror steps into that breach, taking us back to 11th-century England and the Norman Conquest, to the story told in the Bayeux Tapestry   which you may have heard will be loaned back to the UK from France in 2026. King and Conqueror is the story of how Duke William of Normandy, a man descended from Vikings, won the English throne and became William the Conqueror. But it s also the story of the rise and fall of Harold Godwinson, the last crowned Anglo-Saxon king of England, and a man who had to die for William to succeed. And it s the story of an unlikely bromance between these two men, underscored by an almost-certainly ahistorical heart-to-heart in a bathtub. Who are the king and conqueror of King and Conqueror? James Norton (Happy Valley) stars as Harold Godwinson and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) plays his nemesis, William of Normandy, aka the Conqueror. The eight-part drama begins with the coronation of Harold s predecessor, Edward the Confessor, in 1043, and takes us through to exactly where you d think it would (and if this is a spoiler, apologies, but you ve had nearly 1,000 years to catch up): with Harold dead at the battle of Hastings, with an arrow in his eye. James Norton plays Harold Godwinson in BBC Norman Conquest drama King and Conqueror (Photo via BBC) Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays William the Conqueror in BBC Norman Conquest drama King and Conqueror (Photo via BBC) Whether Harold really was felled by an arrow is a point of scholarly debate (tied to the Bayeux Tapestry, which confusingly, isn t even a tapestry) but the show does a nifty job of explaining the arrow away. Also neatly handled in a story dominated by three men are the women behind the Norman Conquest: Matilda of Flanders (William s wife), Emma of Normandy (Edward s mother), Edith the Fair (Harold s wife) and Edith of Wessex (Harold s sister and Edward s wife, who is named Gunhild in the show). They are all able political actors in their own right, as they were in real history. Elsewhere, though, King and Conqueror could be seen to fall foul of its own ambition, truncating and conflating people and events to its own ends. The portrayal of poor Harald Hardrada, in particular   the Norwegian king and third claimant to England s throne   falls into a familiar  brutish Viking  trope. Is King and Conqueror a true story? Yes, a lot of King and Conqueror is a true story   in the sense that Duke William did invade England, Harold was slain on the battlefield at Hastings, and William claimed the throne in his place   but liberties have been taken with the historical record. Not least, if you set aside Harold, almost none of the historical figures who die in King and Conqueror (and it s a surprising number) meet their end how they are supposed to, when they are supposed to or where they are supposed to. That seems to have been unavoidable as the eight episodes span more than 20 years   there is a lot of history packed in here, and not a lot of time to cover it. Watch this video for the truth behind William and Harold's in-show bromance, or scroll on for the real history behind King and Conqueror   and if you don t want spoilers, look away now. King and Conqueror: the real history ** This section contains major spoilers for King and Conqueror** King and Conqueror opens in 1043, with the coronation of Edward the Confessor. The real Edward was a monarch popularly described as being a bit weak and feeble, and perhaps more concerned with preparing his soul for life ever after than the daily rigours of kingship. This holier-than-thou reputation may have been the result of reinvention and revisionism   historian Tom Licence describes him instead as  strong, glorious, feared by his enemies , a king who wielded power in his own right. But it is the feeble Edward we see here, a touched man who hears the whispered word of God and is ruled by his domineering mother, Emma of Normandy. Eddie Marsan and Juliet Stevenson as King Edward the Confessor and his mother, Emma of Normandy (Photo via BBC) Emma bears the distinction of being the only woman to have been consort to two kings of England: Aethelred the Unready and Cnut the Great. She is also the mother of two more English kings: first Harthacnut from 1040 until 1042, then Edward immediately after. In King and Conquerer, Edward s court is dominated by two factions   the Normans, led by Emma, and the Godwin family. Here, as in real history, Earl Godwin of Wessex is one of the most powerful men in England. His rise came during the chaos that followed the Danish conquest of England in the early 11th century, when he became an advisor to King Cnut. He forged a familial tie with Cnut by marrying a Danish wife, Gytha, whose brother was a jarl [a Danish chief] married to Cnut s own sister. And he created another familial tie with Edward the Confessor, arranging for the king to marry his daughter Edith. This brought Godwin to the height of his power   though in real history, almost three years into Edward s reign. In King and Conqueror Godwin s daughter is named Gunhild, presumably because Harold also marries an Edith, and the laws of historical drama say you can t have two people with the same name. Godwin also has more sons than we see on the small screen   Sweyn, Harold and Tostig should have also been joined by Gyrth, Leofwine and Wulfnoth. In real history, that was important to the succession crisis that happened two decades later. But for now, it is 1043, and it is Edward s coronation. William is present, and he and Harold have met. Neither of these things are true   the earliest existing record of William coming to England says he does so in 1051, and he couldn t have met Harold on that occasion as Harold was in exile (more on that in a moment). The first confirmed meeting we know is in 1065, when Harold ends up in Normandy, and when he apparently swears on holy relics that he would support William as the next king of England. As King and Conqueror tells it, no sooner does the crown touch Edward s head than Emma reveals her true intentions, using her son to banish the Godwins from England. They escape to Flanders, ruled by the Machiavellian Count Baldwin, but minus Harold s wife Edith, who is kidnapped by the Mercians during the escape. William appears here too   he s been ousted from Normandy by his one-time protector, King Henry I of France, who now seeks to murder William and absorb Normandy into his own lands. It makes sense that he would be here, because his wife is Matilda of Flanders, and Baldwin is her father. Though she probably didn t moonlight as a torturer, as the show implies.

The first wife of Harold Godwinson, there's a myth that she was the one to identify his body at Hastings (Photo via BBC) If these events seem a bit rushed, it s because this is contracted history: the real Godwins were exiled, but not until 1051   nearly a decade into Edward s reign. Edith, as far as we know, was never taken captive. Some of the family end up in Flanders, but not all. Harold, in particular, heads to Ireland, before the Godwins raise armies and sail back to regain their lands. He is not Earl of Wessex by this point, as he is in the show   his father doesn t pass on the title until his death in 1053   and so Harold does not have to betray his elder brother Sweyn to get the earldom. Meanwhile, William did have to face down Henry for control of Normandy, but that conflict dragged from the early 1050s through to Henry s death in 1060; during a siege, not the dramatic flourish of single combat as is depicted here. Remember: almost no one dies when, where or how they are supposed to. From there we leap forward to Harold s trip to Normandy, bringing us to the beginning of the Bayeux Tapestry. Now we are in more familiar territory: Harold apparently swearing to uphold William s claim to the crown over the relics of Bayeux; the succession crisis precipitated by Edward the Confessor s death in 1066; Harold taking the throne; Tostig s betrayal; Harald Hardrada s invasion; and finally the three battles that would define England, culminating at Hastings on 14 October 1066. William and Harold share confidences in bathing scene that almost certainly would not have happened (Photo via BBC) What happened to Sweyn Godwinson? The real Sweyn Godwinson does die while ostensibly on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but the reasons for that spiritual journey were quite different. King and Conqueror gives Sweyn Godwinson, the eldest son of Earl Godwin and brother of Harold, a much bigger role in Harold s story than we think he had in real history. A boorish lout, he is shown as quick to anger and rash in action, at one point drawing his sword in the presence of the king to the astonishment of all around him. This is no man fit to rule Wessex, and Godwin passes him over for Harold, mollifying Sweyn with the promise of the earldom of Northumbria. When Harold robs him of that too   giving Northumbria to another brother, Tostig Godwinson   Sweyn becomes a liability, prompting Harold to force Sweyn on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Sweyn escapes, and begins plotting to regain Wessex through force, so Harold has him assassinated. None of that happened as far as we know, but the real Sweyn   who held real power as Earl of Herefordshire   was nonetheless something of liability. In 1046 he abducted an abbess from Leominster, prompting his exile to Flanders in 1047, yet he was back in Englandin 1049, after making a plea to King Edward. That same year, he murdered his cousin, prompting a second exile that was not so easily forgiven. He went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and died in unknown circumstances on his return journey. Whether he was forced to make it as in King and Conqueror, we don t know, but we do know this all took place before Godwin himself died, so Sweyn was never passed over for the earldom of Wessex. Did King Edward the Confessor kill his mother, Emma of Normandy? There is no evidence that Edward the Confessor beat his mother to death with his crown   in fact, says historian Tom Licence, it would have been completely out of character.  It wouldn't fit my understanding of their relationship,  says Licence, who was speaking on this episode of the HistoryExtra podcast about Edward the Confessor's life.  Edward's way of punishing people was to take away their assets or to put them into exile. He hit them in the pocket, not over the head.  While King and Conqueror portrays Edward as so feeble he cannot do without his mother   until he snaps and does away with her entirely in the middle of the series, and in a manner befitting Game of Thrones   the real Edward simply removed her from any proximity to power. When he became king, he confiscated her assets and sent her into  retirement  in the Winchester countryside.  Edward most likely wanted to reduce her political involvement back to a simple status as the widow of the former kings, leaving him to rule independently,  writes historian and archaeologist Cat Jarman.  As far as we know, she lived the rest of her life in Winchester.  Did Edward invite William of Normandy to be his successor? Edward the Confessor may have offered his distant cousin William of Normandy the throne   but probably not by letter, and probably not when King and Conqueror suggests he does. In the drama, Edward sends William a letter naming the Norman duke as his heir after Harold s return from exile. This is what prompts Harold to go to Normandy   taking on the role of messenger, he wants to see how William reacts. But if the real Edward did offer William the throne, it would probably have been when he invited William to England in 1051.  There's definitely contact in that crucial period where the Godwins are expelled,  writes historian Marc Morris.  The Norman and the English sources together   and the behaviour of Edward and the Godwins   strongly suggests that Edward did make a promise of the throne to William.  Eddie Marsan and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror. If the real Edward did offer William the crown, it would probably been in 1051, while the Godwins were in exile (Photo via BBC) Historian David Bates argues that, when Edward died 15 years later and Harold was pronounced king, William would have been compelled to press his claim as a matter of personal honour.  Whatever one makes of the actual dispute, I'm quite prepared to believe that he believed he'd been named as Edward's successor,  Bates told us an upcoming episode of the HistoryExtra podcast about the life of William the Conqueror.  He was presumably going around saying  I'm going to be the next king of the English    it would [have] almost been that he would've lost face if he hadn't tried.  What did Harold really swear to William at Bayeux? No one knows for certain whether Harold gave a solemn oath to uphold William s claim to the English throne. This is a moment of realpolitik in the show, where William springs the oath on Harold in front of witnesses instead of merely confirming an alliance, to the outrage of both Matilda of Flanders and Edith the Fair , who have conspiring towards peace (real history doesn t tell us if Matilda and Edith ever met). Harold, displaying his father s talent for getting out of a tight spot without breaking his word, promises to support the  rightful king . Their eyes are daggers. Harold is forced to swear an oath in the presence of witnesses in King and Conqueror; in real history, he similarly may have been compelled to act under duress (Photo via BBC) This moment, on which the Norman Conquest turns, takes place in 1065. Norman and English sources vary on what was said, and even where this meeting took place   it may not have been Bayeux. Even why Harold went to Normandy is up for interpretation: was it as a messenger, or to assert himself? Did he even mean to meet with William? Whatever the case,  he came into William s hands   as a guest, according to the Normans; as a captive, according to the English,  says Licence on the HistoryExtra podcast.  William then took him campaigning, for diplomatic effect   to show off his new prize and give the impression that Harold was his guest.  This 19th-century illustration depicts Harold Godwinson swearing fealty to William of Normandy   a moment shown in the Bayeux Tapestry. The oath, allegedly made during Harold s visit to Normandy, later served as William s justification for his invasion of England in 1066. (Photo by Getty Images) Did Harold swear his oath under duress then? One detail that the show doesn t include is that, since the 1050s, the real William had been holding one of Harold s brothers (Wulfnoth) and a nephew (Hakon) as hostages. Freeing them may have been the entire reason for Harold s visit.  Harold probably did promise something to William   otherwise, the duke wouldn t have let him go (along with one of the hostages). But it s doubtful that he swore to uphold William s claim to the throne.  Did Edward the Confessor die in a bathtub? No, Edward the Confessor did not die in a bathtub in the throes of passion while his wife Edith of Wessex tried to foist an heir upon him. They may not have even consummated the marriage.  There's a very strong, traditional argument that Edward never really entertained the idea of having a child with Edith,  historian Marc Morris says on our podcast series 1066: The Battle for England. He points to the fact that when the Godwins were exiled in 1051 2, Edward went so far to imprison Edith in an abbey. Even though she was brought back to court when the Godwins returned to power, in that time he made no plans to remarry. The real Edward died on 5 January 1066, after an illness of a few months. This was barely a week after the consecration of Westminster Abbey, where Harold was crowned king the following day. Why did Harold Godwinson claim the throne of England? It is not because he promised his father on his deathbed in the 1060s, as depicted in King and Conqueror   but it may have something to do with someone else s last words.  Debate still rages about what happened on Edward s deathbed,  writes historian Caitlin Ellis. King and Conqueror suggests that Edward said nothing intelligible about the succession and that Harold outright lied to further his own ambitions, but real history is more nuanced.  The Life of King Edward, [a tract] commissioned by his wife and queen Edith   [has Edward] stretching his hand out to Harold and, referring to Edith who was there, declaring  I commend this woman and all the kingdom to your protection ,  says Ellis.  But was protection the same as taking the throne for himself?  Whether that is what Edward meant is also debated   there is some evidence that, regardless of any promise he may have made to William in 1051, Edward now favoured the claim of his only blood relative, the boy Edgar  theling. Edgar isn t mentioned at all in King and Conqueror. Harold s claim rested on him being the most powerful noble in Anglo-Saxon England, and this is where Harold s many brothers come back into the story. By the late 1050s the Godwins controlled Wessex, Northumbria, East Anglia, Kent, Surrey, and parts of Middlesex and Essex, and he made sure to spread his influence beyond the family too.  He goes to great lengths to build bridges with former enemies to make sure he has across the board political approval,  says Marc Morris on our podcast series 1066: The Battle for England, noting that Harold is merely the brother-in-law of the king.  If you are dynastically secure, if you are the son of the previous king and you've been groomed your whole life to succeed your father, and the political community expects that, then you don't need to go to these lengths.  The thing that shows the weakness of Harold's claim is how much people at the time said everybody wanted him to do it.  1066: The battle for England Member exclusive | The year 1066 is the most famous in English history, but there's a lot more to the story than one bloody battle at Hastings.

Watch all episodes now The year 1066 is the most famous in English history, but there's a lot more to the story than one bloody battle at Hastings. In this four-part series, medievalist Marc Morris talks David Musgrove through the full story of the Norman Conquest. Why did Tostig Godwinson betray Harold   and did Harold kill him? Tostig had as much reason for betraying Harold in real history as he does in the King and Conqueror, but there s no evidence that Harold personally killed him at the battle of Stamford Bridge   accidentally or otherwise. Tostig s time as Earl of Northumbria in the show comes to an end when Harold replaces him with Morcar, the Earl of Mercia. It s part of the price that Morcar demands for supporting Harold s claim to be king   the other part being Harold s marriage to his sister. In real history, Tostig was replaced in 1065, while Edward the Confessor was still alive, and in circumstances that testify to how much power Harold had over the king. Luther Ford plays Tostig Godwinson (Photo via BBC) Tostig, it turns out, was not a good earl   he taxed heavily, allegedly murdered some nobles, and was generally unjust   and so Northumbria revolted and offered Morcar the earldom. Morcar, you should know, was not already Earl of Mercia. That belonged to his elder brother Edwin, another historical figure missing from King and Conqueror. Edward s plan was to restore Tostig by force; but Harold overruled him, instead agreeing with the rebels demand to install Morcar. This backfired spectacularly.  The problem was that Harold agreed to a plan in which Tostig gets nothing,  says Morris.  Tostig is gone forever. Perhaps further down the line, Harold thought  Well maybe I can reintroduce him, after a period of political exile , but that wasn't what was agreed, and Tostig is clearly beyond furious about it.  And that fury took him to Norway, and Harald Hardrada. Who was Harald Hardrada and what was his claim to the throne? Reduced to a growling Viking during his limited screentime in King and Conqueror, Harald Hardrada was king of Norway whose English ambitions rest on an inherited claim   but he wasn t invited by Emma of Normandy. In the show, Emma writes to Harald inviting him to claim the throne; the real Emma couldn t have done so in 1060s, as she died in 1052, but there is speculation that in the 1040s she may have written to his predecessor (and for a time, co-ruler as King of Norway), Magnus the Good. Harald Hardrada at the 1066 battle of Stamford Bridge, where both he and Tostig met their demise (Photo via Alamy) As Caitlin Ellis explains:  The later Norse sagas claim that Harald s nephew and erstwhile co-ruler Magnus had made a pact with Harthacnut, King of England and Denmark, as they both lacked male heirs, and when one of them died, the survivor would accede to the other s thrones in addition to their own.  When Harthacnut died, Magnus indeed acceded to the throne of Denmark for a time, but not that of England, as Edward the Confessor had had himself crowned. Harald may have had a tenuous claim, but in all likelihood, he was simply being opportunistic in 1066.  Did Harold Godwinson have two wives? Yes, Harold Godwinson did have two wives, Edith the Fair and later Ealdgyth of Mercia (Margaret in the show)   though only one was married to him in the eyes of the Church. Edith and Harold were married more danico   in the Danish way   which among the nobility of the time would have been seen as perfectly lawful, though not Christian. That meant he could ecclesiastically take Ealdgyth as a second wife, which he likely did to shore up his allegiances in the Midlands and Northumbria in a post-Tostig England   she was sister to Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria. There is some debate as to whether Harold proposed this marriage as early as 1063, which would have brought him closer to Mercia and the leaders of North Wales in place of Northumbria; all we can be sure of is that they were married by early 1066. In the show, neither this marriage pact nor the earldom are enough to prevent Morcar from betraying Harold at Hastings by refusing to enter the fray, rounding off his broadly despicable portrayal. Whether he was quite this much of a villain is not clear   the sources don t explicitly say where the real Morcar (or Edwin) were during the battle. Was Harold killed by an arrow from God? Harold Godwinson probably wasn t killed by an arrow at all   much less one guided by the hand of God. The idea of the arrow   depicted as a crafty bit of post-mortem modification to Harold s corpse in King and Conqueror   has its roots in the Bayeux Tapestry, though some have suggested that its presence there may be the work of later embroiderers rather than its 11th-century creators. But righteousness does hang heavy over the Normans in history, as it does in the drama. Much is made of the comet seen before the battle of Hastings (true   it s Halley s Comet, and it appears in the Bayeux Tapestry) and that William s half-brother Odo secured the blessing of the Pope (partially true   whatever papal backing the Normans had, Odo likely didn t have much to do with it). The extent of the Pope's support in real history is unclear. William of Poitiers writes that Pope Alexander II did sponsor the invasion with a papal banner, but on this episode of HistoryExtra podcast, historian Dan Armstrong suggests that a banner may have been granted later, in 1070, when papal envoys came to England to bolster William s shaky legitimacy, and that Poitiers may have backdated the event to justify the conquest. Arrow or no, we do have some corroboration for an alternative, notes Caitlin Ellis.  The Song of the Battle of Hastings [Carmen de Hastingae Proelio] says instead that Harold was attacked by four knights, including William himself, and that he's basically hacked to pieces.  And so we come to William s coronation   not immediately after Hastings, but on Christmas Day 1066. Ad King and Conqueror is streaming on BBC iPlayer now.

        "target_summary": "Amidst a popular surge of Viking-themed dramas, the BBC's \"King and Conqueror\" finally dramatizes the pivotal year of 1066, tracing the epic clash between Harold Godwinson, England's last Anglo-Saxon king (James Norton), and William, Duke of Normandy (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), who would become \"the Conqueror.\" The eight-part series, spanning from Edward the Confessor's coronation in 1043 to Harold's fateful demise at Hastings, weaves a tale of ambition, betrayal, and even an anachronistic bathtub \"bromance\" between the rivals. The drama also highlights the often-overlooked political influence of women like Emma of Normandy and Matilda of Flanders.\n\nHowever, this sweeping saga is not without significant historical reimagining. While the core events—William's invasion, Harold's defeat—remain, the drama frequently \"truncates and conflates\" figures and timelines for narrative impact. Many historical figures, for instance, meet their end differently than documented, and intimate moments, like Harold's forced oath to William or Edward the Confessor's dramatic death at the hands of his mother, are often entirely fictionalized for heightened drama. The portrayal of Edward as feeble and ruled by his domineering mother, Emma of Normandy (who in the show actively invites Harald Hardrada to invade, despite being dead years earlier), contrasts sharply with scholarly understanding. Similarly, the series invents Harold orchestrating his villainous brother Sweyn's assassination and exaggerates the circumstances of Harold's claim to the throne, which was more rooted in political power than a deathbed promise. Even Harold's iconic arrow-in-the-eye death is presented as a crafty post-mortem modification in the show, reflecting ongoing historical debate. Ultimately, \"King and Conqueror\" delivers a compelling, albeit historically liberal, interpretation of England's turbulent transition from Anglo-Saxon rule to Norman dominion, prioritizing dramatic effect over strict adherence to the historical record.",

        "content": "Duke William of Normandy, who would become known as William the Conqueror, arguably changed the course of English history more profoundly than any ruler before or since. Ad Despite beginning life as a child of uncertain status in a volatile duchy, he died as king of a realm he had seized by force then reshaped through reform, repression and relentless control. But how did an illegitimate Norman boy become the founder of England s new ruling dynasty? That s a central question posed in the new BBC series King and Conqueror, that tackles William the Conqueror s role in the turbulent and dramatic run up to the events of 1066. Who was Willam the Conqueror? William the Conqueror was the first Norman king of England, whose reign overhauled the country s politics, aristocracy and relationship with Europe. Born the illegitimate son of Duke Robert I of Normandy, William became duke as a child. He fought to secure his rule in a violent and unstable duchy with the support of his wife Matilda of Flanders. In 1066, he claimed the English crown after the death of Edward the Confessor, arguing that Harold Godwinson had broken an oath to support his succession. William s victory at the battle of Hastings marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule. As king, William violently suppressed rebellion to emphasise his power, most brutally during the Harrying of the North. He also restructured the Church, redistributed land to Norman lords and ordered the Domesday Book in 1086. His rule bound England to Normandy and initiated four centuries of close ties to continental Europe. His death in 1087 left a legacy that defined the English monarchy for generations. Watch: The real history behind King and Conqueror The rise of William s family and the Dukes of Normandy By the early 11th century, Normandy was largely shaped by two competing forces: its Viking past, and its evolving place within the feudal politics of France. Just over a century before William s birth, the area that would soon become Normandy was a buffer zone on the edge of Carolingian control.  It was an originally Viking settlement, which was created into a territorial principality, which became Normandy,  says historian David Bates on an episode of the HistoryExtra podcast. To curb repeated Norse raids up the River Seine in what is now France, the country s monarch King Charles the Simple of West Francia struck a deal in AD 911 with a Viking leader named Rollo. In exchange for land around Rouen, Rollo agreed to be baptised, swear loyalty to the king and defend the Seine valley from further Viking attacks. This 1909 illustration depicts the baptism of Rollo, the Viking leader who became the first ruler of Normandy. His conversion to Christianity marked a turning point in the integration of Norse settlers into Frankish society. (Photo by Getty Images)  | When was the Viking Age? Rollo s descendants, who would agree to adopt France s titles and language, became the dukes of Normandy. They ruled as quasi-independent magnates with only nominal ties to the French crown. But despite their growing integration into French aristocratic culture, they still retained their own distinct martial identity: military ambition, legal innovation and castle-building became central to their power. As Bates explains,  there was of course some memory of their Viking past.  This shaped the Norman identity and, by the early 11th century, Normandy was densely fortified and, therefore, militarily effective. Its dukes were patrons of reform-minded monasticism, close to Rome and increasingly influential. This was the context that William would be born into. Why was he called William the Bastard? William was born in either 1027 or 1028, the only son of Duke Robert I of Normandy and a woman named Herleva, who was  probably the daughter of a tanner   someone of lower social status . His parents  union wasn t consecrated by the Church, which made William bastardus in Latin, a label that would dog him throughout his life. When did William become Duke of Normandy? When his father died in 1035   while returning from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem   William inherited Normandy. He was just seven years old. With Robert s death came an almost complete collapse of central authority. Rival Norman barons, some of whom questioned the legitimacy of the succession, seized land and turned to private warfare. Several of William s guardians were assassinated, and the young Duke was moved frequently to keep him safe. That William survived at all is surprising, and he owed it in part to the support of King Henry I of France. Henry initially acted as William s protector, helping him to secure the ducal throne against the rebellious Norman barons. The most important instance of this support came in 1047, when Henry fought alongside William at the Battle of Val s Dunes, helping to suppress a major rebellion. William s victory at Val s Dunes, alongside his king, allowed him to begin seriously asserting central authority, rebuilding ducal institutions and strengthening his control of the duchy. Over the following decade, William acted decisively to suppress revolt, assert feudal rights and place his own supporters in positions of power. His military campaigns were complemented by a programme of ecclesiastical reform, especially through his support of Benedictine monasticism. He built and endowed abbeys at Caen, F camp and Jumi ges, aligning himself with both the papacy and the wider reform movement in the Church. William and Henry I of France As William s power in Normandy grew, it threatened the balance of power in northern France, and his alliance with Henry I deteriorated in the early 1050s. By the mid 1050s, Henry had allied with Geoffrey Martel, Count of Anjou, one of William s main rivals, and the two launched several campaigns against Normandy. William defeated these invasions, most notably at the Battle of Mortemer in 1054 and at Varaville in 1057. Bates explains:  it was a manifestation of something that was becoming very clear: William was good at war.  Yet William s success was as much about circumstance as his military prowess, as both Henry and Geoffrey died in quick succession.  Suddenly the world has changed radically, and the two rivals, believe it or not, were succeeded by children,  says Bates. William and Matilda: what was their relationship like? William s marriage in around 1050 to Matilda of Flanders, the daughter of Count Baldwin V, cannily expanded his alliances. Despite initial opposition from the Pope (due to close familial relationship between the couple) the marriage was sanctioned after penance. A 19th-century illustration of Matilda of Flanders, queen consort of William the Conqueror. Married around 1051, Matilda played a key political role in Norman England and was one of the most influential royal women of the 11th century. (Photo by Getty Images)  Matilda becomes increasingly prominent in the 1050s,  explains Bates.  It is a very successful marriage. It's a very important feature in their lives.  Matilda was also a capable and active consort in her own right.  Matilda is left in effect as the ruler of Normandy in 1066,  says Bates. Her name also appears in charters as a co signatory, reflecting her recognised authority. Together, they had at least nine children, four of whom were sons: Robert Curthose, William Rufus, Richard (who died young), and Henry: all future players in Anglo-Norman politics. What was William s claim to the English crown? William's interest in England s affairs stemmed from family and politics. Edward the Confessor, who ruled England from 1042 to 1066, had spent much of his formative life (roughly from 1016 to 1041) in exile at the Norman court, after his family was ousted by Danish rule. During this period, he developed close ties with Norman aristocracy and ecclesiastics. He spoke Norman French and retained Norman clerics and courtiers after his accession. And according to Norman claims, Edward himself had promised William the English throne, likely in the early 1050s.  I think William made a journey to England in the year 1051, in which, so he claimed, he was promised the succession to the English kingdom by Edward the Confessor.  Whether that promise was ever actually made   or whether it was retroactive propaganda from later Norman sources   there are plausible reasons why Edward might have considered William to be best-placed for the role. It s possible that Edward regarded the Norman ducal family with trust, perhaps more so than the boisterous and powerful Anglo-Saxon nobility that he contended with as king of England. Edward s reign was dominated by the Godwin family, particularly Earl Godwin of Wessex and, later, his son Harold Godwinson. Edward had a tense relationship with the Godwins, culminating in their exile in 1051 and swift return in 1052, which left Edward politically weakened. During the brief period of their exile, Edward may have looked abroad to William as a way of reasserting royal authority. Also, Edward had no children and, as he aged, the question of succession became increasingly urgent. Promising the crown to a continental ally like William might have served both as a hedge against unrest in England and a means of asserting control over the succession; at least in theory. When did William meet Harold? The one meeting between William and Harold that we can be sure of occurred in 1065, when Harold, the most powerful English noble, was shipwrecked in Normandy and taken into William s custody. In this scene from the Bayeux Tapestry, messengers inform William of Normandy that Harold Godwinson has been captured by Count Guy of Ponthieu in 1064   a key moment in the events leading up to the Norman Conquest of England. (Photo by Getty Images) By this point, Harold was Earl of Wessex and the leading nobleman in England, second in power only to King Edward. According to Norman chroniclers, Harold travelled across the Channel on a mission related to Edward s succession, possibly to confirm Edward s earlier promise that William would inherit the throne. English sources make no mention of such a mission, and some later writers suggest Harold s voyage was prompted instead by a family matter in Ponthieu. Whatever its purpose, the journey brought Harold directly into William s orbit for the first time. When Harold arrived on the Norman coast in 1064, he was reportedly shipwrecked off the coast of Ponthieu and captured by Count Guy of Ponthieu, who held him for ransom. It was William who secured Harold s release, either through negotiation or by paying Guy compensation. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts William ceremoniously welcoming Harold into Normandy. During Harold s stay under William s watch, the two men campaigned together in Brittany to support William s ally, Duke Conan II, against a rebellion. Harold fought alongside William s troops, distinguishing himself in battle and earning praise from the Norman duke. The joint campaign strengthened the personal ties between them (at least, temporarily) and demonstrated Harold s military competence. Did Harold give his sworn oath to William? One of the most infamous and contested episodes of Harold s visit to Normandy is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry: Harold swearing a solemn oath to William while placing his hands on what appear to be two reliquaries. This 19th-century illustration depicts Harold Godwinson swearing fealty to William of Normandy   a moment shown in the Bayeux Tapestry. The oath, allegedly made during Harold s visit to Normandy, later served as William s justification for his invasion of England in 1066. (Photo by Getty Images) According to Norman sources such as the priest William of Poitiers, this oath bound Harold to support William s claim to the English throne upon Edward s death, and to uphold William s interests in England. The dramatic staging of this event, with sacred relics hidden beneath a cloth and revealed only after the oath, emphasised the sacred and binding nature of Harold s pledge in Norman eyes. Under medieval custom, an oath sworn on holy relics was considered irrevocable; breaking it could be framed as a mortal sin. Whether Harold made the oath freely or under duress remains uncertain, but it became central to William s justification for invading England in 1066. What was William s claim to the English crown? Edward the Confessor died on 5 January 1066, leaving no heir. The next day, Harold Godwinson was crowned king of England   a decision supported by the Witenagemot, the English council of nobles. William viewed this as a betrayal. He asserted his claim that Edward had promised him the throne and that Harold had sworn to support him. He therefore denounced the English election as invalid and unjust.  Whatever one makes of the actual dispute, I'm quite prepared to accept that he believed he'd been named as Edward's successor,  says Bates.  I think it was almost a matter of personal honour.  But it wasn t just William who had a claim; at least two others had legitimate reasons to feel entitled to the throne. Harald Hardrada asserted that Magnus I of Norway had been promised the English crown by Harthacnut, Edward the Confessor s half-brother, in a mutual succession pact. When Harthacnut died in 1042, Magnus never pursued the claim, but Harald considered it valid, especially after Magnus s death. With the support of Tostig Godwinson, Harold s exiled brother, Hardrada led his own invasion. His failure   defeated at the battle of Stamford Bridge by Harold   is seen as the traditional end of the Viking Age. Another with a strong claim was the closest blood relative of Edward the Confessor: Edgar Aetheling, a great-nephew of the king and a descendant of the royal house of Wessex. However, Edgar, then only 14 or 15 years old, lacked the political backing or military support to press his claim. Crucially for his claim to the English throne, William obtained papal backing from Pope Alexander II, who sent a consecrated banner for the invasion, framing the conquest as a righteous cause. This support helped William recruit troops, ships and financing from across Normandy and neighbouring regions. He was now more than a regional duke pursuing personal ambition; he had become a sanctioned leader of a vital religious campaign. The Norman invasion of England and the battle of Hastings On 28 September 1066, William landed at Pevensey in Sussex. His fleet is estimated at 600 ships and a force of 7,000 to 8,000 men, including Normans, Bretons, Flemings, and French mercenaries.

(Photo by Getty Images) He quickly established a fortified base and began raiding the surrounding countryside. Meanwhile, Harold Godwinson had just defeated a major invasion in the north by King Harald Hardrada of Norway and his exiled brother Tostig, at Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Forced to march south depleted and exhausted, Harold confronted William at Hastings on 14 October. The battle of Hastings was fought from morning to dusk. Harold s forces fought from the high ground in a traditional shield wall formation, while William s mixed infantry and cavalry launched repeated assaults. After several hours of stalemate, feigned Norman retreats reportedly lured English troops into disorder. In the final assault, Harold was killed. His death led to the collapse of concerted English resistance. Though not crowned immediately, it was at Hastings that William had effectively won the throne. The Norman Conquest and reorganisation of England William was crowned King of England in Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1066. But his Norman Conquest was far from complete. Resistance   led by figures like Hereward the Wake   persisted for years, and indeed nearly toppled the new king. Such was the scale of the revolt against new Norman rule, Bates says, that William  was facing a moment towards the end of 1069 when everything he wanted to accomplish and believed he had been accomplishing was likely to be destroyed . The most infamous episode was the devastating Harrying of the North, during which William laid waste to large parts of Yorkshire and the Danelaw, leaving vast areas utterly destroyed and depopulated. Contemporary chroniclers described famine, scorched villages and fields sown with salt. It was a calculated move to quash any further resistance. To consolidate power, William rebuilt England s aristocracy almost entirely. Over 4,000 Anglo-Saxon landholders were replaced, with most of the country s land given to a smaller group of around 200 Norman lords. Castles, including motte-and-bailey structures, were built in major towns to secure military control. The Church was also restructured. Archbishop Stigand (the last Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury) was removed and Lanfranc, a Norman reformer, was appointed as his replacement. Thus, the English Church was brought into alignment with continental practice and papal reform ideals. In 1086, William commissioned the Domesday Book, a detailed survey of landholding and resources. It remains the most complete record of any European society in the Middle Ages and a testament to William s administrative accomplishment.

William s later reign was consumed by disputes in France. His eldest son, Robert Curthose, rebelled repeatedly over the control of Normandy. Relations with the French king and other nobles became tense, and William returned to the continent frequently to defend his ducal lands. In 1087, while campaigning in the Vexin, William suffered injuries during a raid. He died in Rouen on 9 September 1087. According to one account, his bloated corpse burst during the burial in Caen, where he was laid to rest in the Abbaye-aux-Hommes, a monastery he had founded. Who succeeded William the Conqueror as king? Wiliam the Conqueror's lands were divided after his death: his son Robert inherited Normandy, while William Rufus took the English crown, becoming William II. This separation of realms would lead to decades of rivalry between his sons. Despite the short-term turbulence that followed his death, William s conquest permanently transformed England s political and cultural trajectory. The Anglo-Saxon elite was utterly supplanted, a new aristocratic language was put in place and the legal structures that underpinned society were reshaped. But perhaps his most enduring legacy was geopolitical: William bound England to Normandy, and the wider affairs of continental Europe. For the next four centuries, English monarchs would hold territory in France integrating the country into the web of Franco-Norman aristocracy, leading to complex cross-Channel loyalties and confrontations. William redirected the shape of England s trajectory and the age of the Anglo-Saxons ended with his coronation. A new English identity took shape. It was now time for the rule of the Norman kings. 1066: The battle for England Member exclusive | The year 1066 is the most famous in English history, but there's a lot more to the story than one bloody battle at Hastings.

        "target_summary": "William the Conqueror, an extraordinary and arguably the most pivotal figure in English history, rose from the unlikely beginnings of an illegitimate Norman duke to irrevocably reshape a kingdom. His origins were rooted in Normandy, a formidable duchy forged from Viking settlement in 911 AD. This unique principality, though nominally tied to the French crown, cultivated a distinct martial identity, marked by military ambition, strategic castle-building, and an evolving feudal prowess, which William would fully embody.\n\nBorn \"William the Bastard\" around 1027 to Duke Robert I and a woman of lower status, his early life was fraught with peril. He inherited the volatile duchy at just seven years old upon his father's death, plunging Normandy into a period of chaos, assassination, and baronial rebellion. Surviving against the odds, William shrewdly consolidated his power, demonstrating remarkable military acumen. With initial, albeit temporary, support from King Henry I of France, he suppressed major revolts, most notably at Val ès Dunes in 1047. Over the ensuing decade, he systematically asserted ducal authority, enforced feudal rights, and embarked on significant ecclesiastical reforms, aligning himself with the burgeoning papal reform movement. His growing strength eventually led to conflict with King Henry, but William's decisive victories solidified his dominance in northern France. His politically astute marriage to Matilda of Flanders around 1050 further expanded his influence, with Matilda herself proving a capable and active consort, even governing Normandy in his absence.\n\nWilliam's gaze eventually turned across the Channel to England, a fascination deeply rooted in King Edward the Confessor's long Norman exile. This period fostered close cultural and political ties, and crucially, Norman sources claim Edward had promised William the English throne in the 1050s, perhaps as a means to counter the powerful Anglo-Saxon Godwin family and ensure a stable, childless succession. A pivotal moment occurred in 1065 when Harold Godwinson, England's leading nobleman, was shipwrecked in Normandy. Rescued by William, Harold reportedly swore a solemn, religiously binding oath—a moment dramatically depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry—to support William’s claim to the English crown.\n\nWhen Edward died childless in January 1066, Harold was swiftly crowned king by the Witenagemot, a move William vehemently denounced as a profound betrayal of both Edward's promise and Harold's sacred oath. Marshaling a vast invasion fleet, he secured crucial papal endorsement, elevating his ambition to a sanctioned religious crusade and attracting widespread support across Europe. While other claimants, like Harald Hardrada, also vied for the throne, William's meticulous preparation and papal legitimacy set him apart.\n\nIn September 1066, William's formidable forces landed at Pevensey. Harold, having just defeated Hardrada in a bloody northern campaign, was forced to march his exhausted army south to confront the invaders. On October 14, the brutal, all-day Battle of Hastings ensued. Harold’s disciplined shield wall initially held firm against repeated Norman assaults, but cunning feigned retreats eventually lured sections of the English army into disorder. The death of Harold sealed William’s decisive victory, effectively seizing the English throne on the battlefield.\n\nCrowned King of England on Christmas Day 1066, William's conquest was far from complete. He faced years of fierce and widespread Anglo-Saxon resistance, which he brutally suppressed. The most infamous episode was the devastating \"Harrying of the North\" in 1069, a calculated scorched-earth policy that laid waste to vast regions, extinguishing rebellion through famine and terror. To solidify his dominion, William systematically dismantled the Anglo-Saxon elite, replacing over 4,000 landholders with a new Norman aristocracy, and securing control with a network of castles. He profoundly restructured the Church, bringing it into alignment with continental practices, and demonstrated his administrative genius with the monumental Domesday Book of 1086—an unprecedented survey of landholding and resources.\n\nWilliam’s later years were largely consumed by ongoing disputes in France and challenges from his rebellious eldest son. He died in 1087 from battle injuries, leading to the immediate division of his lands between his sons, sparking future rivalries. However, his conquest left an indelible mark on England. It utterly supplanted the Anglo-Saxon elite, introduced a new aristocratic language and legal framework, and, most profoundly, integrated England into the complex geopolitical fabric of continental Europe for centuries. His rule irrevocably altered England's historical trajectory, forging a distinct Anglo-Norman identity that would define the kingdom for generations.",

        "content": "Everyone loves a good story, and the clash between Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror on 14 October 1066 has been a starting point for storytellers ever since   not least the creators of new BBC drama King and Conqueror. Ad How did the two men meet? Why did they come to blows, and why did England s king die at the hands of a foreign invader? Few people knew the answers to those questions, and those who did were not impartial. A backstory was therefore invented, to suit the tastes of William s supporters. Or is that Harold s? In fact, there are multiple overlapping backstories, stitched together from legends, guesswork, and propaganda. The historian s task is to sift through all the stories and pick out what might be of use. When did Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror first meet? We know that Harold and William met late in Edward the Confessor s reign, most likely in the summer of 1065. But is this when they first met? In the absence of detailed records, this question is difficult to answer. Harold isn t mentioned in the chronicles before 1049, well into his twenties, so an early meeting with William can t be ruled out. And it s likely that Harold knew who William was. As a son of the Earl of Wessex, he should have known something of the neighbouring princes who, through trade and peacekeeping, had dealings with his father. Normandy was just across the Channel   a neighbour of Wessex in effect. He would have known that the king, Edward the Confessor, had recently lived in Normandy and attended William s court. James Norton plays Harold Godwinson in BBC Norman Conquest drama King and Conqueror (Photo via BBC) Nikolai Coster-Waldau plays William the Conqueror in BBC Norman Conquest drama King and Conqueror (Photo via BBC) But the early 1050s brought trouble for Harold: There was a powerful party of Normans at Edward s court, vying with Harold s family to dominate the king s counsel. Matters came to a head in 1051   Harold s family lost, and were driven into exile. In late 1051, William visited Edward in England, but Harold was in Ireland and would not have met him then. At some point, probably in 1052, William also got hold of two of Harold s close relatives   a brother and a nephew   as hostages. Harold, still in exile, would not have met him then either. But from then on, William was associated with the hostile Norman party at Edward s court. Exactly how William got hold of Harold s relatives as hostages is far from clear. They may have been kidnapped by the Normans who fled England when Harold s family returned in 1052. Or perhaps Edward sent them to William in case Harold s family sought vengeance upon him for their exile. Either way, in Harold s mind, William was now a hostile agency, who had something over on him. King and Conqueror imagines William and Harold sharing confidences in bathing scene, something that almost certainly would not have happened (Photo via BBC) It's possible that Harold met William in the mid-1050s. Edward s contemporary biographer reports that Harold travelled in the Frankish lands and studied the tactics and capabilities of Frankish princes. A charter of 1056 shows that Harold was present in Flanders at that time, with its count, Baldwin, and other counts, including Guy of Ponthieu (who appears in the Bayeux Tapestry). Although William doesn t appear with him in the charter, Harold might have visited other places besides Flanders on his foreign trip. He may at some point have visited Normandy to see the hostages, and from 1053   after succeeding his father as Earl of Wessex   he d have had to deal with William in cross-Channel business. But the only meeting we can be sure of occurred late in Edward s reign, most likely in the summer of 1065, when Harold travelled to the Frankish lands a second time. He came into William s hands   as a guest, according to the Normans; as a captive, according to the English   and the two men went campaigning in Brittany. Watch: The real history behind King and Conqueror Why did Harold travel to Normandy? The first generation of English writers after the Norman Conquest are totally silent about Harold s trip, which is telling in itself. It suggests that something happened that was relevant to 1066 and that had to be covered up. Norman sources claim that Edward had sent Harold to offer William the English throne (or to confirm an earlier promise). English sources give various explanations, including an attempt to bargain for the release of the hostages and a fishing expedition blown off course (which is possibly a euphemism for an intelligence-gathering trip).ge The Bayeux Tapestry may imply that Harold wasn t heading for Normandy, since it shows him landing in the neighbouring county of Ponthieu, whose count begins to escort him north to Beaurain, in the opposite direction. But men from William arrive and pressure Guy into handing Harold over. The one thing that does emerge from a judicious appraisal of this mixed bag of sources is that Harold tried to avoid falling prey to William. William then took him campaigning, for diplomatic effect   to show off his new prize and give the impression that Harold was his guest. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts Harold Godwinson being apprehended as he lands in Ponthieu and taken prisoner by Count Guy of Ponthieu (Photo via Getty) When he later made Harold swear oaths of some sort, the set-up was the same. Harold appeared, before onlookers, to swear the oaths willingly but in reality did so under duress. It was a piece of political theatre. Norman and English sources disagree on the content of the oaths and even on where the ceremony took place (Bayeux, Rouen, and Bonneville-sur-Touques all being named by different writers). William s supporters, defending his invasion after 1066, claimed that Harold had sworn to uphold the Duke s claim to the English throne and garrison castles for him. Other accounts told of oaths Harold had sworn involving a marital alliance with the Norman ducal house. Harold probably did promise something to William   otherwise, the Duke wouldn t have let him go (along with one of the hostages). But it s doubtful that he swore to uphold William s claim to the throne, which was manufactured in 1066 and justified in hindsight. There s no evidence in any source from before that date that Edward desired to make William his heir. This 19th-century illustration depicts Harold Godwinson swearing fealty to William of Normandy   a moment shown in the Bayeux Tapestry. The oath, allegedly made during Harold s visit to Normandy, later served as William s justification for his invasion of England in 1066. (Photo by Getty Images) By that point, if not long before, Harold and William were rightly very wary of each other, harbouring multiple grudges. From William s point of view, Harold s family had thwarted Norman ambitions at Edward s court and crushed and expelled the Norman faction. From Harold s perspective, William was a wily opponent who had a hold over his family in the form of the two hostages. Eadmer, an English writer born in 1060, presents William as an extremely dangerous man, which he was. William s supporters project such qualities onto Harold, portraying him as an arch-deceiver, treacherous in every respect. At the battle of Hastings, there was no neat accidental death by a random arrow. Rather, William s troop made a beeline for Harold and hacked him to pieces, with one knight cutting off Harold s genitals as a trophy. The world was too small for two men such as Harold and William to share it. Undoubtedly, there was a lot of additional backstory that we ll never know. The bitterness of 1066 does suggest that William felt that Harold had betrayed him somehow. Harold, for his part, may have had no other choice, realising that William was a man like himself, who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. 1066: The battle for England Member exclusive | The year 1066 is the most famous in English history, but there's a lot more to the story than one bloody battle at Hastings.

        "target_summary": "The legendary clash between Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror in 1066 ignites enduring narratives, yet the true prelude to this pivotal conflict remains a tapestry woven from conjecture, propaganda, and fragmented history. Historians grapple with piecing together the enigmatic relationship between these two formidable figures, whose early interactions are shrouded in uncertainty. While a definite meeting occurred around 1065, evidence hints at earlier, indirect connections. Harold, a rising Anglo-Saxon Earl, would have been acutely aware of William, the ambitious Duke of Normandy, a potent neighbor whose dealings with the English court and his own father undoubtedly featured in his political landscape.\n\nA period of intense courtly struggle in the 1050s saw a powerful Norman faction vie for influence against Harold’s family under Edward the Confessor. This rivalry culminated in Harold’s family's exile, a turbulent time during which William notably acquired two of Harold’s close relatives as hostages. This act fundamentally altered Harold's perception of William, imbuing their relationship with a deep-seated suspicion and animosity long before their fated confrontation.\n\nThe most concrete encounter between them transpired in the summer of 1065. Harold journeyed to the Frankish lands, where he fell into William’s orbit—whether as an honored guest or a reluctant captive is a matter of historical debate, influenced by nationalistic chroniclers. During this period, the two men even campaigned together in Brittany. The exact purpose of Harold’s journey itself is deliberately obscured in English sources, hinting at a politically sensitive mission that required cover-up. Norman accounts, however, brazenly claim Edward had dispatched Harold to confirm William's succession to the English throne. Other English narratives offer less dramatic explanations, such as an attempt to bargain for his relatives’ release or even a storm-blown voyage. The Bayeux Tapestry adds another layer of intrigue, suggesting Harold was initially apprehended by a count in Ponthieu before being delivered to William, underscoring Harold’s apparent reluctance to fall under the Duke’s influence.\n\nCrucially, during this encounter, William compelled Harold to swear oaths. This was a calculated piece of political theatre, designed to showcase Harold’s supposed willing allegiance, though it was almost certainly enacted under duress. The precise content of these oaths is vigorously disputed: Norman chroniclers asserted Harold swore to uphold William’s claim to the English throne and garrison castles for him, while others spoke of promises related to a marital alliance. While Harold likely made some concession to secure his release—indeed, William freed him and one hostage—the notion that he swore to support William’s claim to the throne is highly suspect, largely considered a retrospective justification for the 1066 invasion. Prior to this, there is no solid evidence that King Edward ever intended William as his heir.\n\nBy the time of the fateful Norman Conquest, a profound and irreconcilable bitterness simmered between Harold and William. Each harbored deep-seated grievances: William perceived Harold’s family as having deliberately thwarted Norman ambitions, while Harold viewed William as a dangerous and manipulative adversary holding his family captive. Contemporary accounts, colored by partisan loyalties, painted William as an exceedingly dangerous man and Harold as a treacherous deceiver. The tragic climax at the Battle of Hastings was no mere accident; rather, it was a brutal, targeted assault, ending with Harold’s savage dismemberment by William's knights. Ultimately, the historical record suggests the world was simply too confined for two such fiercely ambitious and unyielding men to coexist, leaving a legacy of conflict born from ambition, political maneuvering, and a history forever shrouded in conflicting narratives.",

        "title": "This medieval king was hunted down and brutally murdered   and we still don t know who killed him",
        "content": "In the summer of 1488, King James III of Scotland was fleeing a battlefield. His army had collapsed at the battle of Sauchieburn, and his teenage son, the future James IV, had joined the rebel nobles who had taken up arms against him in an attempt to eliminate his power by installing a council of regency. Ad But King James didn t die on that battlefield. Instead, he had tried to regroup at Blackness Castle, on the south shore of the Firth of Forth, but fled when rebel forces advanced, and was intercepted near a mill outside Bannockburn. What happened next remains one of the most unresolved and politically resonant royal deaths in Scottish history. James III, lying on the ground after his horse shied (Photo via Getty)  We just know there was a pursuit to get to a mill and then he's stabbed by someone,  explains historian Gordon McKelvie, speaking on the HistoryExtra podcast.  Some people clearly thought this guy was fleeing. Someone must have seen him and went after him.  Supposedly, that someone would go on to stab   and kill   the king. Who exactly delivered that fatal wound is still unknown. Arguably more striking is that there was never even an attempt to hold any single person to account.  There's never been a full investigation,  says McKelvie.  No one is ever found guilty of it. The fact there s no investigation tells us a lot.  A king without friends James s death may be mysterious, but his unpopularity was incredibly evident, and simple to explain. Throughout his reign, the king had consistently alienated the powerful men who were meant to support him, and isolated himself from traditional networks of power. McKelvie notes that James  is someone who is reputed to have not liked the company of his nobles,  and that  he was not universally liked   he s described as a king who surrounds himself with unpopular favourites . That fact   prioritising favourites over the hierarchy of nobles   is a recurring motif in medieval history, and a deadly trap that many of history s worst monarchs have fallen into. But it wasn t just seeking the company of the wrong individuals that ruined James III s status as king. He had also earned a reputation for turning against those closest to him.  He also is tainted with potentially killing his wife as well,  McKelvie says. Margaret had died from sudden illness, with potential foul play being suspected.  His reputation generally [was] as someone who will harm members of his own family.  That included his brother, Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, whose somewhat death in France during a duel had already cast a long shadow over the king. This all contributed to a portrait of James as a monarch whose downfall had become increasingly inevitable as he failed to navigate the dangerous terrain of kingship. The new regime benefited from silence After James III was killed, the new regime under James IV offered a vague, bloodless explanation: the king had been slain  by a vile person . It was, as McKelvie puts it,  as ambiguous as you can get.  The wording is telling; not only in its evasion, but in what it chooses not to pursue.  Even if James IV didn t want his father harmed,  McKelvie notes.  He must have known a rebellion that leaves a king alive never succeeds.  Did James IV have his own father killed? (Photo via Getty) It was in the new king s political interest to ensure his father didn t survive the rebellion, and even more so that no one investigated how, or by whose hand, the old king had died. The result was a murder with no trial, no punishment and no clear record of guilt. King James III, now dead, was simply brushed out of history by his own son. Flight, fatalism, and a royal ending What little we do know of the specific circumstances surrounding James III s death paints a picture of a monarch brought down not by one knife used by a single discontented murderer, but by years of corrosive mistrust and resentment. His capture and murder weren t part of a formal execution. They were, more likely, an act of political necessity by the rebels. No killer was ever named. No one was punished. The new regime moved on, and the question of who killed the king was quietly left behind. Yet though James s death remains shrouded in mystery, the causes are anything but.  Even though he didn t stab himself,  McKelvie reflects,  he was more responsible for his own death than anyone else.  Isolated, distrusted, and ultimately abandoned, James was a monarch whose murder remains an unsolved mystery not because the truth couldn t have been discovered, but because no one in power had any inclination to discover it.",
        "target_summary": "In the tumultuous summer of 1488, Scotland’s King James III found himself in a desperate flight from the battlefield of Sauchieburn, his army shattered and his own son allied with the rebellious nobles seeking to dismantle his power. Though he escaped the immediate carnage, fate would soon catch up to him. After attempting to regroup, James was intercepted near a mill outside Bannockburn, where his shying horse brought him to the ground. What transpired next remains one of the most enigmatic and politically charged royal deaths in Scottish history: he was stabbed to death by an unknown assailant.\n\nThe murder of James III is striking not just for its brutality, but for the profound lack of accountability that followed. Historians note the absence of any investigation, trial, or punishment for the king's death, leaving the identity of the killer forever shrouded in speculation. This silence, however, speaks volumes about James's reign. He was a monarch who systematically alienated his powerful nobles, preferring the company of unpopular favorites and isolating himself from traditional networks of power. His reputation was further tarnished by whispers of foul play in the death of his wife, Margaret, and suspicion surrounding the demise of his brother, painting a portrait of a king estranged even from his own family.\n\nFollowing the king's demise, the new regime under his son, James IV, offered a conveniently vague explanation: the king was \"slain by a vile person.\" This ambiguous declaration served a crucial political purpose. James IV, who had ridden with the rebels, stood to benefit immensely from his father's death and the subsequent lack of inquiry. A live king could reignite a rebellion, and a thorough investigation might reveal inconvenient truths. Thus, the new king allowed the murder to recede into history without consequence, effectively sweeping the uncomfortable details under the rug.\n\nUltimately, James III's death was not merely the result of a single assassin's blade but the culmination of years of corrosive mistrust and resentment. He was, in the words of one historian, largely the architect of his own downfall. Isolated, distrusted, and ultimately abandoned by those who should have supported him, James III's mysterious end was a politically expedient act by his enemies, ensuring the stability of the new regime. The truth of who struck the fatal blow remains an enduring enigma, not because it was impossible to uncover, but because no one in power had any desire to find it.",

Ad 1000 1100 Eadric Streona Nominated by Professor Sarah Foot of Sheffield University Illustration by Jonty Clark Eadric Streona (died 1017) might have been Aethelred II s chief counsellor and ealdorman of Mercia   but he has a reputation for deception, treachery and murder. I nominate him because of the villainous part he played in England s defeat by the Danish king, Cnut. He was implicated in the murder of Gunnhild and Pallig in 1002 and of Ealdorman Aelfhelm in 1006   at which time the ealdorman s two sons, Wulfheah and Ufegeat, were blinded. In 1009 when the English were ready to attack the Danes a Chronicler reported that the whole people  was hindered by Ealdorman Eadric, then as it always was . In 1015 he was directly involved in the murder of two thegns (noblemen)   Sigeferth and Morcar   who, according to chronicles, he  enticed  into his chamber where they were  basely killed . In the same year, having been in command of King Aethelred s army, he changed sides and joined Cnut. He subsequently switched sides a further couple of times, in 1016 joining first Edmund Ironside and then deserting him at the battle at Assandun (Ashingdon) to rejoin Cnut who pursued Edmund into Gloucestershire where the latter died in mysterious circumstances. This cruel, unscrupulous individual grew rich out of the proceeds of royal taxation and was a traitor to the English cause. But having being initially rewarded by Cnut   when he d become king of all England   Eadric was killed in 1017 having outlived his usefulness to the new regime. It was a fitting end. Sarah Foot is the author of Monastic life in Anglo-Saxon England (Cambridge University Press, 2006). 1100 1200 Thomas Becket Nominated by Professor John Hudson of St Andrews University Illustration by Jonty Clark There are a handful of characters in history about whom prejudice seems impossible to avoid. One such is Thomas Becket (c 1120 70), Archbishop of Canterbury. He divided England in a way that even many churchmen who shared some of his views thought unnecessary and self-indulgent. And he has remained a figure inspiring both devotion and detestation. He was a founder of gesture politics, with the most acute of eye for what would now be called the photo-opportunity. He was also a master of the soundbite. When put on trial in front of a secular court, he refused to accept its jurisdiction, stating  such as I am, I am your father; I will not hear your judgement . He pushed his way from the court chamber, bearing his cross before him. Complex issues were confronted by a mixture of inflexibility and grand display. When he left England during his dispute with Henry II, he went to the kingdom of France, furthering the conflict between Henry and the French king, and at the very least opening himself to the accusation of being a traitor. Certainly he was viewed by some as hypocritical, as he changed dramatically from his ostentatious life-style before he was archbishop. As archbishop, he also looked to contemporary medical views for help in retaining some enjoyable habits, claiming to have to drink wine rather than water because it better suited his stomach. He was also greedy. In 1164 he was brought to trial in part on charges of embezzlement during his time as royal chancellor, the position he held before he became archbishop of Canterbury. The truth of such charges must remain uncertain. However, the wealth of Thomas and his following by the late 1150s was immense and famous. How did he assemble such wealth? Presumably by profiting from his position in the royal administration. Those who share my prejudice against Becket may consider his assassination in Canterbury Cathedral on 29 December 1170 a fittingly grisly end. However, it also ensured that, as a martyr, he became a saint with a cult that spread with tremendous speed.

Perhaps his most damning critic was Matthew Paris, a monk at St Albans, who in the mid 13th century wrote:  Foul as it is, Hell itself is defiled by the fouler presence of King John . This kind of verdict was eagerly seized on by 19th-century historians to create the monster of legend, the Bad King John. However, the fact remains that John committed some wicked deeds and was a deeply unpleasant person. He was unpleasant in many ways   in the way he behaved towards people; he was untrusting; he would snigger at people while they talked; he couldn t resist kicking a man when he was down. What s more, he was a bully and a gloater. Stories about his cruelty are legion, and the deed which has most damned him in the eyes of the world is the murder, possibly by his own hands, of his nephew Arthur   a rival for the throne. Granted, John was competent when it came to the small-scale tyrant stuff   he could lead an army, he was energetic and dynamic   but his charisma was all negative. He didn t inspire loyalty, so people deserted him. That was partly why he lost his father s continental lands   in effect, squandering the family inheritance. He was clearly one of the worst kings in English history and his reign will always by defined by that one great evil deed   the murder of his nephew. One good thing to come out of his reign was Magna Carta, an attempt to limit his abuses and ensure they could not be repeated. Marc Morris is author of The Bigod Earls of Norfolk in the Thirteenth Century (Boydell, 2005). 1300 1400 Hugh Despenser (the Younger) Nominated by Nigel Saul, professor of medieval history at Royal Holloway, London University Illustration by Jonty Clark I nominate Edward II s appalling favourite, the Younger Hugh Despenser (died 1326). Despenser was neither so well known nor so notorious as his predecessor in Edward s favour, Piers Gaveston, but he was far worse. Gaveston was just a playboy. Despenser was pure evil. Dominant at court in the last years of Edward s reign, he set about eliminating his enemies and amassing a vast territorial empire in South Wales. His rapacity knew no bounds. He gobbled up the lands and possessions forfeited by those who opposed him and his king. He browbeat the weak and the vulnerable into signing away their estates. He tricked people into parting with their property. Women were especially vulnerable to his ambitions. Alice Lacy, the Earl of Lancaster s widow, was thrown into prison and forced to sign away her rights. The widow of Sir John Gifford of Brimpsfield was ejected from her estates. Lady Baret of Swansea was allegedly tortured so badly that she went out of her mind. Visiting merchants were robbed of their property. In a stained glass window in Tewkesbury Abbey, Despenser looks all arrogant and swagger. But pride cometh before the fall. In the autumn of 1326 the tyrannical regime Despenser headed was toppled, and Edward deposed. At Hereford in November he was visited with the full penalties of the traitor. He was drawn, and then hanged from a gallows 50 feet high; his intestines were torn out and burned in front of him.

In this link between religious ideas and sedition lay the foundation for a system of persecution of religious ideas in England which would be used by rulers for centuries. Until Arundel, England had no part in the intensive inquisitorial and persecutory activities which had long been common practice on much of the Continent. The Concordat between Henry IV and Arundel gradually created such a system through ordinances and statutes. At Oxford in 1407 he phrased ordinances   later extended as Constitutions for the realm   which limited the translation and reading of the Bible in English. The programme was completed shortly after his death, when secular officials, royal justices and sheriffs, were required by oath to enquire into heresy wherever their powers took them. As a result, he made life harder for a generation of people who wished to express and explore their religious ideas, to read the Bible in a language they understood, and discuss the  big questions , while his clearing out of  venomous weeds  from Oxford meant that intellectual life there became bland for a very long time. Above all, by enlisting royal officials, and encouraging neighbours to snoop, suspect and inform   he authorised a thoroughly unpleasant involvement of the state in people s lives.

According to John Foxe (author of the Acts & Monuments of the English Martyrs, first published in 1563), he was personally responsible for the torture of Anne Askew   who d broken off her marriage to an orthodox Catholic   in 1546 and was charged with heresy. He is reputed to have operated the machine himself despite the fact that women (and especially gentlewomen) were supposed to be exempt from torture. He is alleged to have committed perjury to secure the conviction of Thomas More for treason. He promoted Protestantism under Edward VI, and then persecuted Protestants under Mary. A lawyer by profession, Rich was a man who was constantly on the make, constantly on the lookout for the main chance. He became a powerful minister to Henry VIII and was Lord Chancellor during much of King Edward VI s reign. It is difficult to quite know what to make of him personally but nobody seems to have been very fond of him. Greedy he certainly was, and cruel   to judge from the Anne Askew affair. He was responsible for several burnings of heretics in Essex, and acted as a bigot because it was convenient to appear as such at that time. In short, Rich was a slippery and unprincipled opportunist. For centuries after his death his name was a byword in the county of Essex for wickedness. Right up to the 20th century, it was said  better a poor man at ease than Lord Rich of Leighs . David Loades is the author of Intrigue and Treason: the Tudor Court 1547 1558 (Pearson, 2004). 1600 1700 Titus Oates Nominated by John Adamson, a fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge University Illustration by Jonty Clark The self-styled Dr Titus Oates (1649 1705) was in a league of his own, both in the depths of his vileness   a comprehensive blend of vanity, murderous con-trickery, and serpentine guile   and the scale of the evil for which he was responsible. He was the principal promoter, in 1678, of the fantasy that there was a Jesuit conspiracy to assassinate Charles II (with silver bullets) as a prelude to a French-backed Catholic reconquest of the country. Undoubtedly his most evil act was allowing 16 innocent laymen, and eight Catholic priests, to go to a hideous death (the penalty for treason being partial hanging, castration and disembowelment alive, and then the quartering of the corpse) as a result of his spurious accusations. Oates s entire career was built on the purveyance of various forms of malice and falsity. At the height of the Popish Plot mania, he laid an indictment against the Lord Chief Justice who, refusing to succumb to the popular hysteria, had acquitted four of the men implicated by Oates s accusations. He would have willingly sent these four, and the Chief Justice, to the gallows for his own aggrandisement. Anyone who is prepared to see innocent men go to their deaths   and particularly grisly deaths at that   on accusations that he knows to be false qualifies as cruel, bloodthirsty, and a bigot. What makes Oates s knavery all the more invidious is that his motives appear to have been largely financial: he expected, and eventually obtained, a substantial reward from the Whig interests which profited from his accusations. In 1678 79, Oates s actions arguably brought the country close to the brink of another civil war. And while Oates did not create anti-Popery, his fantasies certainly sharply exacerbated a religious hatred that would endure in British society well into the 19th century. In short, he was a thoroughly odious individual. John Adamson is author of The Noble Revolt: The Overthrow of Charles I (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2007). 1700 1800 Duke of Cumberland Nominated by Professor Rab Houston, chair of modern history at St Andrews University Illustration by Jonty Clark The Duke of Cumberland (Prince William Augustus, 1721 65) showed his wickedness in many ways, not least in his contempt for opponents and for his own men who failed to live up to his strict standards. He showed a particular disdain for the defeated Jacobites after the battle of Culloden in 1746, who he regarded as cowardly, dishonourable and undeserving of mercy. Thus fleeing soldiers were pursued and slaughtered while the wounded could expect no help except to be shot, bayoneted or clubbed to death. At a time when the etiquette of warfare was considered very important, Cumberland was able to dispense with it by labelling the Highlanders as inhuman savages. He even condemned officers who had shown mercy to the Jacobite soldiers after the battle, when his orders were to give no quarter. The Highlanders hated him, renaming a weed Stinking Billy in mockery of the English renaming of a flower Sweet William in his honour. In effect, he used the full power of the fiscal-military British state to commit genocide on the mainland of Britain. He was the equal of Cromwell in Ireland, terrorising a whole people into submission. The English welcomed the Duke s victory but opinion turned against him equally quickly. He acquired the title of Butcher because, when told that he was to be made an honorary freeman of a London company for his services against the Jacobites, some wag said it would have to be the Butchers. The Duke s successes were recognised by his being voted an income of  40,000 per annum in addition to his revenue as a prince of the royal house. It was, in effect, blood money earned by war crimes. While much of Cumberland s reputation rests on the immediate events surrounding Culloden, he was also a strong advocate and savage pursuer of the suppression of Highland culture. He left behind him the largest army of occupation ever seen in Britain in order to pacify the Highlands while permanent fortifications were built. He contributed to a policy of cultural imperialism by disarming the Highlands, abolishing the wearing of Highland dress, suppressing certain surnames linked with the rebellion and seeking to extirpate Catholicism from the land. He even suggested transporting whole clans like the Camerons and MacPhersons to the colonies   a sort of ethnic cleansing. By helping to destroy the social nexus of the clan that was at the heart of Highland society, he helped sever the bond between chiefs and clanspeople that had been the basis of Highland society for centuries. Lastly, by institutionalising the prejudice that the Highlanders were uncivilised, Cumberland also contributed to the racist views responsible for their later misfortunes.

Firstly, because he preyed on the most pathetic and vulnerable women in London s East End. Secondly, for the sheer horror of his brutal crimes. During his murder spree in the autumn of 1888, Jack the Ripper definitely killed five prostitutes   and possibly a couple of other women too   in the most appalling and extreme circumstances. His victims were disembowelled, their intestines draped over their shoulders and their breasts cut off. This man was manifestly a savage brute and while he may have had mental problems   he must have had, to do what he did   they can t excuse his terrible actions. The murders had huge repercussions at the time   and have influenced our view of serial killers ever since. For months after the murders women across the land, be it in Norwich or Newcastle, were terrified to go out at night. And while the press might have coined the name by which this most notorious serial killer is known, this does not detract from the savagery of his crimes. Of course, we assume it was  Jack , and it probably was, but it just might have been  Jill . The Ripper has become a villain   for all time   and his shadow extends to the present day. And the way in which the world responds to modern serial killers such as the Yorkshire Ripper is influenced by the way we responded to the most notorious serial killer of all, Jack the Ripper. All sorts of people have been accused of being Jack the Ripper: the painter Walter Sickert; rogue royals; Freemasons, you name it   but it seems unlikely we ll ever know his true identity. However, this has just served to add to the mystique surrounding this most wicked of men. Clive Emsley is the author of Hard Men: Violence in England since 1750 (Hambledon, 2005). 1900 2000 Oswald Mosley Nominated by Professor Joanna Bourke of the School of History, Classics, and Archaeology, Birkbeck College, London Illustration by Jonty Clark Oswald Mosley (1896 1980) was the founder of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in 1932. He remains an inspiration for far-right groups in Britain and thus continues to have a pernicious impact on our society. His authoritarian politics relied on anti-Semitism and anti-immigration, and the party s willingness to use violence was most notoriously exhibited at the Fascist rally at Olympia in 1934. His most evil act was inciting anti-Semitic feeling and in 1934, the BUF launched an anti-Semitic campaign in the East End of London, home to one-third of British Jews. He attacked the  big Jews  for threatening the economy and the  little Jews  for  swamping  British cultural identity. While he never succeeded in turning Britain Fascist, 70 per cent of respondents under 30 chose Fascism, when asked to choose between it and Communism, in a Gallup Poll in 1937. He was handsome and charming, and his early career   in the Conservative and then Labour Party   showed him to be a man of ideas and energy. In the early 1920s, his opposition to the  Old Men  who supervised the carnage of the First World War won him many supporters. However he was vain, megalomaniac, and had delusions of grandeur, although Attlee observed that his theatrical displays were routinely derided (at one meeting, when Mosley strode on stage with his arm uplifted, a voice called out,  Yes, Oswald dear, you may go to the lavatory ). It would be difficult to find a more unpopular politician than Mosley in 1945: he was widely regarded as a traitor and a symbol of Fascism. On his death in 1980 his son Nicholas concluded that his father was a man whose  right hand dealt with grandiose ideas and glory  while his left hand  let the rat out of the sewer .

        "target_summary": "This text presents a captivating and contentious list, identifying the ten most \"wicked, harmful, and downright evil\" British figures across a millennium, from 1000 to 2000. This rogue's gallery features an eclectic mix, including royalty, churchmen, and notorious criminals, all leaving an indelible stain on history.\n\n**Eadric Streona (1000-1100)** emerges as a paramount betrayer. As Aethelred II’s chief counsellor, he carved a reputation for ceaseless deception, ruthless treachery, and cold-blooded murder. His villainy played a pivotal role in England's capitulation to Danish King Cnut, marked by his implication in multiple assassinations and the blinding of Aelfhelm's sons. Streona famously switched allegiances repeatedly, enriching himself through royal taxation while actively sabotaging the English cause, ultimately meeting a fitting end at Cnut’s hands.\n\n**Thomas Becket (1100-1200)**, Archbishop of Canterbury, proved a profoundly divisive figure. Master of \"gesture politics\" and inflexible conviction, he polarized England, even among his fellow churchmen. His dispute with Henry II escalated into a wider conflict with France, drawing accusations of treachery. Becket was also labeled a hypocrite for his dramatic shift from an ostentatious pre-archbishop lifestyle, coupled with undeniable greed and charges of embezzlement during his tenure as royal chancellor. His dramatic assassination, however, paradoxically secured his legacy as a venerated saint.\n\n**King John (1200-1300)** is universally cast as a monarch of \"superhuman wickedness,\" his reputation forever tainted by chroniclers who deemed \"Hell itself... defiled by the fouler presence of King John.\" A deeply unpleasant, untrusting bully and gloater, his reign is most infamously defined by the probable murder of his young nephew, Arthur, a rival claimant to the throne. His inability to inspire loyalty led to the squandering of vast continental lands, cementing his legacy as one of England's worst rulers, though his egregious abuses inadvertently paved the way for the Magna Carta.\n\n**Hugh Despenser the Younger (1300-1400)**, Edward II’s appalling favourite, embodied \"pure evil.\" His rapacious ambition knew no bounds, systematically eliminating enemies and forging a vast territorial empire through ruthless means. He relentlessly seized lands, browbeat the vulnerable into ceding estates, and mercilessly tricked individuals out of their property. Women were particularly susceptible to his depredations, with one noblewoman allegedly tortured into madness. Despenser's tyrannical reign culminated in a spectacular downfall and a gruesome execution for treason, a fate befitting his immense cruelty.\n\n**Thomas Arundel (1400-1500)**, Archbishop of Canterbury, earned his infamy by fundamentally reshaping England’s approach to religious dissent. He masterminded an unprecedented fusion of church and state power, laying the groundwork for centuries of systematic persecution against unorthodox religious opinion. Arundel's ordinances severely curtailed the translation and reading of the Bible in English, stifling intellectual life at Oxford. He created a deeply unpleasant system where royal officials and even ordinary neighbours were compelled to snoop out and inform on alleged heresies, intertwining state authority with personal beliefs in an oppressive manner.\n\n**Sir Richard Rich (1500-1600)** epitomized the unprincipled opportunist, a man devoid of genuine political or religious conviction, whose sole drive was self-advancement. He notoriously switched allegiances to whichever side promised greater career benefits, displaying a chilling cruelty. Rich was personally accused of torturing Anne Askew, a gentlewoman, a scandalous act given the conventions of the time, and of committing perjury to secure Thomas More's conviction. His greed and ruthless ambition made him a byword for wickedness in Essex for centuries, remembered as a slippery figure willing to act as a bigot when convenient.\n\n**Titus Oates (1600-1700)** stands out for his profound vileness, a noxious blend of vanity, murderous con-trickery, and serpentine guile. He fabricated the infamous \"Popish Plot,\" a fantastical Jesuit conspiracy to assassinate Charles II, unleashing widespread paranoia. Oates's spurious accusations directly led to the horrific executions of 16 innocent laymen and 8 Catholic priests, condemned to the gruesome penalties for treason. His actions, largely motivated by financial gain, pushed England to the brink of civil war and intensely exacerbated religious hatred, cementing his legacy as a thoroughly odious individual.\n\n**The Duke of Cumberland (1700-1800)**, forever known as \"Butcher Cumberland,\" demonstrated his wickedness through extreme contempt for his opponents and even his own men. Following the Battle of Culloden in 1746, he ordered no quarter for the defeated Jacobites, overseeing the ruthless slaughter of fleeing soldiers and wounded men, justifying his brutality by branding Highlanders as \"inhuman savages.\" He wielded the British state's power to enforce what amounted to genocide and cultural imperialism, disarming the Highlands, abolishing traditional dress, and even suggesting ethnic cleansing through clan transportation, effectively destroying centuries of Highland social structure and fostering lasting prejudice.\n\n**Jack the Ripper (1800-1900)** remains an enduring symbol of unadulterated wickedness, his name synonymous with terror. Operating in London's East End in 1888, he preyed on the city's most vulnerable prostitutes, committing a series of horrifically brutal murders. His victims were disembowelled and mutilated, actions so savage they sent shockwaves across Britain, terrifying women and profoundly shaping the public's perception of serial killers. Though his true identity remains a mystery, the sheer barbarity of his crimes ensures his shadowy presence persists as a definitive villain across time.\n\n**Oswald Mosley (1900-2000)**, founder of the British Union of Fascists (BUF), left a pernicious legacy, inspiring far-right groups long after his death. His authoritarian ideology was built upon virulent anti-Semitism and anti-immigration, notoriously employing violence, as evidenced at the Olympia rally in 1934. His most evil act was directly inciting anti-Jewish sentiment, targeting London's Jewish community with hateful propaganda. Despite his charm and early political dynamism, Mosley was a vain, megalomaniac figure, widely regarded as a traitor whose \"left hand let the rat out of the sewer,\" unleashing deeply destructive forces into British society.",

        "content": "If you ve watched The Tudors on BBC Two over the last few years, you ll have seen Henry VIII as a young man. He was regarded as handsome, athletic and intellectually curious during the early years of his long reign (1509 47). The legendary Henry is the ageing, rotund and ill-tempered king who struggled to produce a male heir and sent two of his six wives to the executioner s block. His story has been told innumerable times, in different styles and from many vantage points, and interest in it shows no signs of abating. Nevertheless, an early talkie, made in 1933 and on a modest budget, remains the definitive portrait of the man. Ad The films 1. The Private Life of Henry VIII Dir: Alexander Korda, UK, 1933. With Charles Laughton, Robert Donat, Merle Oberon, Elsa Lanchester As the title suggests, Alexander Korda s film takes a through-the-keyhole vantage point on Henry, preferring his marital affairs to affairs of state. Catherine of Aragon is swept aside in the flippant opening titles ( her story is of no particular interest   she was a respectable woman ) and the film opens in 1536 as Anne Boleyn (played by Merle Oberon) faces execution with resigned, quiet dignity. It then makes its way through Henry s marriages to Jane Seymour (Wendy Barrie), Anne of Cleves (Elsa Lanchester), Catherine Howard (Binnie Barnes) and Katherine Parr (Everley Gregg). Much of this is played for laughs.  It s all chop and change,  one character observes from the sidelines, and Henry himself groans about  the things I ve done for England  as he reluctantly enters into marriage with the unattractive Anne of Cleves. This is history as it would play at the music hall: filled with saucy comments, naughty puns, and a lusty hero whose appetites render him ridiculous. It is doubtful the film would hold together were it not for Charles Laughton. From the moment he strides into the frame, assuming the aggressive image made famous by Hans Holbein s full-length portrait of Henry, Laughton manages to imbue the iconic figure with humanity, tragedy and humour. This Henry, like Holbein s, is a middle-aged figure striking a powerful pose, but the film is daring enough to play this for laughs. No other actor or film has found this combination of malice and mirth in Henry. Yet as memorable as some of its jokes and its central performance may be, The Private Life of Henry VIII is actually a little too scrappy and rough around the edges to be a true film classic. Its status as a landmark in film history relies as much on its reception as its aesthetic qualities. In the early 1930s, British films rarely travelled well and historical films were out of fashion, but this was an international success and it brought many more historical films in its wake. But is it accurate? Most historians were not impressed. Some complained about the film s focus on the private life, and its complete disinterest in worldly matters. There is no mention of the break with Rome or the English Reformation. Others complained about a plethora of tiny details, including the incorrect placement of the buckles on Henry s shoes. Audiences did not share these concerns, and Korda followed a similar path with his subsequent films about Catherine the Great, Rembrandt and Nelson. Accuracy: 5/10 2. Anne of the Thousand Days Dir: Charles Jarrott, UK/USA, 1969. With Richard Burton, Genevi ve Bujold, Irene Papas, Anthony Quayle Korda s film was made during the Depression, and portrays Henry as the embodiment of the people s will. In the 1960s 70s, however, filmmakers regarded Henry s reign as divisive and authoritarian. Censorship had loosened and religious issues were no longer off-limits, but this view of Henry also suited an era which questioned authority and saw the establishment as corrupt and self-serving. In Anne of the Thousand Days, Henry (Richard Burton) is portrayed as a man eager to justify his actions. He searches his soul, but finding it shallow, arrives quickly at conclusions that suit his own needs. As soon as he spots the young Anne Boleyn (Genevi ve Bujold) he is eager to divorce the loving, but also ageing and clinging, Catherine of Aragon (Irene Papas). He courts Anne, but she has been warned by her sister Mary (Valerie Gearon), who is pregnant with Henry s child, that  the moment you re conquered he ll walk away from you . Anne therefore sneers at his promises of riches and favours, and insists that she ll only sleep with him if they are married, so that their offspring will be in line for the succession. The break with Rome thus serves as Henry s means of conquering the wilful Anne. When they are married, and Elizabeth is born rather than a son, Henry quickly wearies of Anne and so he readily believes the accusations of adultery and incest that lead to her execution. Based on a popular play by Maxwell Anderson, the film is a bit stagey and overly long. Richard Burton also lacks the gusto that might be expected of Henry, but Bujold just about manages to make Anne spirited rather than merely shrewish. There is also ample production gloss in this Hollywood film: stunning photography, lavish sets, beautiful costumes and some attractive location filming. But is it accurate? The film compresses events that took place over many years and fits them into a tight storyline. A more questionable aspect is Anne s defiance of Henry. While it is true that she resisted becoming just another one of his mistresses, it is unlikely that she was hostile to him or berated him in the manner heard here. The ending   when she defiantly declares that  my Elizabeth shall be queen and my blood will have been well spent    gives her the last word, as well as a sense of historical vision, but she would not have imagined this so confidently. Elizabeth s future was far from certain at the time of Anne s execution. Accuracy: 6/10 3. The Other Boleyn Girl Dir: Justin Chadwick, UK/USA, 2008. With Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana, Mark Rylance, Kristin Scott Thomas Henry VIII (played by Eric Bana) is pushed to the sidelines in this account of the aspirational Boleyn family. Based on Philippa Gregory s bestselling novel, the story primarily concerns sisters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson) and their rivalry for Henry s affections. The story itself is speculative, insofar as it tries to imagine what went on behind closed doors and in lives (especially Mary Boleyn s) about which comparatively little is known. It takes considerable liberties. For example, Mary Boleyn was regarded as a  wanton  woman in her lifetime and not as the sweet and innocent girl portrayed here. Mary had an affair with Henry, but there is no evidence that she was his true love (rather than Anne) and most historians disregard rumours that Mary had a child by Henry. There is no record of Mary attending Anne s execution, and afterward she certainly did not kidnap Elizabeth and raise the future queen herself, as the ending of the film suggests. And while Anne was accused of incest, alongside the accusations of adultery, the charge is generally regarded as unjust. The film, however, suggests that Anne and her brother at least contemplated incest, as a desperate means of producing Henry s much-needed heir. Where Anne of the Thousand Days portrays its heroine as fiery and formidable, the Anne of The Other Boleyn Girl is grasping and manipulative. Mary Boleyn is the more sympathetic figure, but Scarlett Johansson looks out of place and her blank expressions are uninvolving. Bana, as Henry, is given little to do other than look mean and moody. The film occasionally comes to a halt as the characters speak in paragraphs to explain the historical basis of the story. But this is really an old-fashioned melodrama, complete with ominous lashings of thunder and lightning, a minxish heroine who meets with her comeuppance, and, in Henry, a brooding and unpredictable hero not unlike Heathcliff. But is it accurate? No, but many people enjoyed seeing the story told in this form rather than as worthy and serious historical drama. It is not for everyone, but if the idea of a 16th-century version of Footballers  Wives is appealing, then this is the film for you. Accuracy: 2/10 Other films about Henry VIII Young Bess (Dir: George Sidney, USA, 1953) Charles Laughton reprises his role as the king in this portrait of Queen Elizabeth I s youth. A Man for all Seasons (Dir: Fred Zinnemann, UK, 1966) Henry (Robert Shaw) is seldom seen in a film which focuses on Thomas More (Paul Scofield) and his execution. Henry the Eighth and His Six Wives (Dir: Waris Hussein, UK, 1972) This is in some respects the opposite of the Korda film: more serious, more accurate and less entertaining.

        "target_summary": "The enduring fascination with England's iconic King Henry VIII, who evolved from a handsome and athletic youth to an ill-tempered, rotund monarch, has inspired countless dramatic retellings. While his story continues to captivate, a select few cinematic interpretations stand out for their distinct approaches and varying degrees of historical fidelity.\n\nAlexander Korda's 1933 classic, *The Private Life of Henry VIII*, offers an intimate, \"through-the-keyhole\" glimpse into the king's tumultuous marital affairs. Dismissing his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, the film immediately thrusts into Anne Boleyn's execution, then humorously navigates Henry's subsequent four marriages. Portrayed akin to a saucy music hall act, with its naughty puns and lusty hero, the film's international success cemented its status as a landmark in British cinema. This enduring appeal owes much to Charles Laughton's definitive performance, which brilliantly imbued Henry with a unique blend of humanity, tragedy, and mirth, capturing both his aggressive power and his ridiculous appetites. Despite its cinematic impact, the film received low marks for historical accuracy, prioritizing domestic drama over crucial events like the Reformation.\n\nDecades later, in the late 1960s, Charles Jarrott's *Anne of the Thousand Days* presented a more authoritarian and introspective Henry, reflecting an era that questioned established authority. Richard Burton's Henry is depicted as a self-serving monarch desperately seeking justification for his actions, notably his pursuit of Anne Boleyn. Geneviève Bujold portrays a spirited Anne, who, warned by her sister, strategically demands marriage to secure her offspring's legitimate succession, thus making the monumental break with Rome a tool in Henry's relentless conquest. Though occasionally stagey, the film boasts lavish production design and compelling performances. While striving for greater historical accuracy than its predecessor, it nonetheless compresses complex events and likely exaggerates Anne's defiant character and prophetic foresight regarding Elizabeth's future.\n\nMore recently, Justin Chadwick's 2008 adaptation of Philippa Gregory's *The Other Boleyn Girl* shifts its focus to the intense rivalry between sisters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson) for Henry's (Eric Bana) affection. This highly speculative melodrama prioritizes emotional drama over historical fact, romanticizing Mary and inventing numerous scenarios, such as her attendance at Anne's execution or the suggestion of incestuous contemplation to secure an heir. While offering a sympathetic, albeit historically inaccurate, portrayal of Mary, the film largely sidelines Henry and is riddled with historical distortions, earning the lowest accuracy score. It caters more to an audience seeking a dramatic, almost sensationalized, period piece rather than a rigorous historical account.\n\nUltimately, these diverse cinematic interpretations showcase the protean nature of Henry VIII's legacy, demonstrating that historical accuracy often bows to the demands of compelling storytelling and the cultural lens through which each film views the iconic monarch.",

        "title": "The Royal Stuarts: A History of the Family that Shaped Britain",
        "content": "Reviewed by: Roger Mason Author: Allan Massie Publisher: Jonathan Cape Price (RRP):  20 Ad At the end of his highly readable chronicle of the lives and loves of the Stuart family, arguably Britain s most successful royal dynasty, Allan Massie concludes:  It was a long journey from the salt-marshes of Brittany to the gloom of the Palazzo Muti.  Originating among the Anglo-Breton aristocracy who settled in Scotland at the invitation of the crown in the 12th century, the family took its name from the hereditary title  High Steward  bestowed upon Walter Fitzalan by King David I. Several generations later, his direct descendant, Walter Stewart, married Marjorie, daughter of Robert Bruce, and it was their son who came to the Scottish throne as Robert II when the main Bruce line failed in 1371. For the next 150 years, Stewart son followed Stewart father until the death of James V in 1542, leaving as his sole legitimate heir a six-day-old daughter, Mary Queen of Scots. That Mary succeeded unchallenged is testimony to how deep-rooted the principle of primogeniture had become in Scotland, where the antiquity and continuity of the royal dynasty was seen as a symbol and guarantor of the kingdom s independence. As an adult, of course, Mary tested Scottish political conservatism to the limits   and well beyond. Yet by marrying a member of a cadet branch of the family, Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, and bearing him a son, James, Mary did at least ensure the future of the dynasty, albeit now under the Frenchified form of the name, Stuart. Not only that, but despite Mary s execution at the hands of Elizabeth for conspiring to oust the Tudors, in 1603 her son became King James I of England and Ireland as well as James VI of Scotland. For the next century and a half the Stuart family dominated the politics of Britain and Ireland, whether as reigning monarchs struggling (and, in the case of Charles I, spectacularly failing) to maintain control of their composite monarchy or as Jacobite  pretenders  to the throne following the overthrow of James VII and II in 1688 amidst fears that this Catholic king had ensured a Catholic succession. Spanning well over three centuries, and with a cast of compelling characters, the story of the Stuarts is an entertaining family saga that combines high political drama with low personal farce. But it is also a story that can be told as a constitutional history of Britain in what was a formative period in its development, characterised not only by the union of the Anglo-Scottish crowns and parliaments, but also by the rise and fall of monarchical absolutism. All the more surprising therefore that it is a story that has been so seldom chronicled in full. And all the more welcome that a writer of Allan Massie s undoubted talents should rise to the challenge. Better known as a novelist, Massie s interest in history is long-standing and, like his fellow borderer Sir Walter Scott, with whom he clearly identifies, he possesses an encyclopaedic knowledge as well as intuitive understanding of the past. This he brings to bear to good effect in writing a pacy and often pungent narrative that brings the Stuarts individually to life while weaving around their dynastic story a broader history of Scotland before the union of 1603 and of Britain thereafter. Overall, though always readable, the book is weakest on Stuart kings like James III and James V, where Massie too readily falls back on stories culled verbatim from Scott s Tales of a Grandfather. It is at its best in dealing with Charles I and Charles II, where a compelling contrast between the two kings is developed in the context of civil war, interregnum and restoration. Perhaps inevitably these chapters are essentially Anglocentric, but the British dimension reasserts itself in the reigns of William and Anne during which the parliamentary union was effected and the old Stuart composite monarchy was transformed into the new British monarchical state. Only a diehard Whig would leave it at that, however, and Massie well knows that the dispossessed Stuarts continued to pose a very real threat long after the Glorious Revolution. Fittingly his story ends with a sprightly account of the Jacobite rebellions which, if notably free of Scott s sentimental romanticism, remains nonetheless sympathetic to the plight of the exiled Stuarts, acutely conscious of their royal heritage, but increasingly aware that their cause had little resonance beyond the faded glory of their residence the Palazzo Muti in Rome. Ad Roger Mason is professor of Scottish history at the University of St Andrews",
        "target_summary": "Allan Massie's highly readable chronicle embarks on a captivating journey tracing the Stuart family, arguably Britain's most successful royal dynasty, from their 12th-century Anglo-Breton origins in the salt-marshes of Brittany to their poignant decline in the gloom of Rome's Palazzo Muti. Named after the hereditary title \"High Steward,\" the family ascended to the Scottish throne in 1371 with Robert II, forging a lineage that would ensure Scotland's independence for generations.\n\nDespite her tumultuous reign and eventual execution, Mary Queen of Scots crucially secured the dynasty's future through her son James, who remarkably united the crowns of Scotland, England, and Ireland in 1603 as James I/VI. For the next century and a half, the now 'Stuart' family dominated British politics. Their rule encompassed both grand struggles for monarchical control—most notably Charles I's spectacular failure—and later, the poignant efforts of Jacobite 'pretenders' following James VII and II's overthrow in 1688.\n\nMassie, a novelist with an encyclopaedic knowledge and intuitive grasp of history, crafts a pacy and often pungent narrative. He not only brings individual Stuarts vividly to life but also skillfully interweaves their dynastic saga with a broader constitutional history of Britain during a truly formative period—a chronicle of monarchical absolutism's rise and fall, and the transformative union of crowns and parliaments.\n\nWhile occasionally leaning on Sir Walter Scott for earlier kings, Massie excels in depicting Charles I and II, drawing compelling contrasts between them amidst the turbulence of civil war, interregnum, and restoration. Though some chapters bear an Anglocentric tilt, the British dimension is powerfully reasserted during the reigns of William and Anne, when the parliamentary union finally forged a new British monarchical state. The narrative fittingly concludes with a sprightly, unsentimental yet sympathetic account of the Jacobite rebellions, keenly observing the exiled Stuarts' enduring consciousness of their royal heritage, even as their cause, far from Scott's romantic ideal, became increasingly confined to the faded glory of their Roman residence.",

        "title": "King John and the French invasion of England",
        "content": "\"The whole land was covered with these limbs of the devil like locusts, who assembled to blot out everything from the face of the earth; for, running about with drawn swords and knives, they ransacked towns, houses, cemeteries, and churches, robbing everyone, sparing neither women nor children.\" Ad Thus wrote the contemporary chronicler Roger of Wendover, describing events in England during the winter of 1215 16.  These limbs of the devil  were the troops of King John, engaged in a bitter civil war at the very end of the monarch s reign. This war witnessed the emergence of Magna Carta; the death of King John; a French invasion of England that was almost a second Norman Conquest;  King  Louis I ruling one-third of England for a year; an English naval victory that ranks with the defeat of the Spanish Armada; and a major formative period in the emergence of English national identity. Oh, and it may even provide the prototype for Robin Hood. Despite all this, until now there has been no book dedicated to this dramatic course of events. In popular perception, John is  Bad King John , an impression reinforced with exuberance through decades of negative imagery on the screen. Whether in The Lion in Winter (1968), the BBC series Ivanhoe (1997), or the Robin Hood film starring Russell Crowe, John is portrayed as sly, cowardly, incompetent and completely reprehensible. Despite some attempts at historical revisionism, the popular hostile view remains essentially correct and actually reflects the views of John s contemporaries. William of Newburgh calls him  nature s enemy ; the Barnwell chronicler labels him  a pillager of his own people ; Richard of Devizes depicts him as a raging madman who  emitted foam from his mouth . Even sources from men fighting for John have little good to say of him. The Anonymous of B thune summed John up simply and damningly with  he had too many bad qualities . The rebellion that began in England in 1215 was a long time in gestation, and John was its feckless father. Crowned in 1199, and momentarily victorious over his enemies at Mirebeau (western France) in 1202, John captured and almost certainly murdered his teenaged nephew, Arthur of Brittany, and alienated powerful Norman lords by the harsh mistreatment of his prisoners. Worse still, his defence of his continental lands was fitful and ineffective. By June 1204, the French king, Philip Augustus, had conquered Normandy. Wendover hints that John, who had beaten a precipitous retreat to England, preferred  enjoying all the pleasures of life  with his barely teenaged bride, boasting that he had plenty of money to retake all that had been lost. However, it was the collection of this money that drained baronial incomes and fostered their discontent. The rest of John s reign was dominated by his attempts to win back his lost lands and lost pride. To this end, he put the screws on England. Royal income rose to an all-time high as John relentlessly pursued all sources of revenue, happily capitalising on a papal interdict imposed upon his kingdom (from 1208) to exploit the wealth of the church. More damaging was his treatment of the baronage. Infamously, in 1210 the chronicles unite in reporting that he had the wife and son of William de Briouze, a royal debtor, starved to death, probably in Windsor Castle. At court, his lecherous behaviour led to rumours and accusations that John was a serial seducer of barons  wives and daughters. Two of the rebellion s leaders, Robert fi tz Walter and Eustace de Vesci, offered this as a major reason for their revolt. It seemed that no one was safe from John s arbitrary rule. For his grand French campaign of the summer of 1214, John had exacted a record scutage. Scutage was a feudal relief by which barons paid money in lieu of military service to the crown. John had levied it so often (eleven times compared to Richard s three) that it now resembled a regular tax. It was the last straw. John had poured his huge resources into the campaign only to meet with complete failure in the summer. By September 1214, many barons simply refused to pay scutage. No one believed that John s military endeavours were worth investing in, a feeling readily expressed by the king s revealing contemporary nickname of  Softsword . In John s absence the barons had conspired to resist the king. John returned to England in October to face the greatest threat of his reign. Inconclusive talks between king and barons ran alongside military preparations. War was imminent. By May 1215 it had broken. The rebels, under the title of  the Army of God , mustered at Northampton and formally defied the king by breaking their homage and fealty. Of nearly 200 baronies in England, only some 40 declared for the rebels. However, only a similar number sided openly with the king; the majority simply stepped aside, not wishing to become embroiled in the conflict. Families were split in their loyalties: William Marshal, soon to be regent of England, stood by the king, while his eldest son opted for the rebels. John s main advantage was his string of some 150 royal castles across the country. The same month, the Army of God had their greatest success: they occupied the city of London, a vital power base that they held for over two years. Across the country, Lincoln, Northampton and Exeter also fell to them as they gained momentum and the political initiative. With the tide turning against him, John agreed to meet the rebels at Runnymede here, in mid-June, he sealed Magna Carta. Among its clauses, Magna Carta calls for a guarantee to all free men of protection from illegal imprisonment and seizure of property. It also demands access to swift justice, and, anticipating parliamentary assent for taxation, scutage limitations as agreed by a new  common council  of the realm. All are indictments of John s style of governance. The charter established a monitoring committee of 25 barons with a mandate to wage war on the king if he failed to uphold the agreement, something one historian has called  the most fantastic surrender of any English king to his subjects  But John was only buying time and never had any intention of honouring the charter. It proved but a temporary truce. By the time the war restarted in September, much had changed. The king had the backing of the pope, who denounced Magna Carta as  not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust  and now placed the rebels  lands under interdict. Meanwhile the rebels had sought a powerful new ally of their own: Prince Louis of France, heir to the French throne. With no disaffected royal family member with whom to join in common cause (John was the last of Henry II s sons), Louis, later known as the Lion, was the natural choice. His wife, Blanche of Castile, was a grand-daughter of Henry II. (Louis might actually have inherited the Angevin lands legally had John died without children.) He accepted the offer of the crown of England and promised help. This aid did not come soon enough to help the rebels besieged in Rochester Castle. Under the command of William d Albini, they held out against the might of John s concentrated forces for seven weeks. The Barnwell annalist declares that  living memory does not recall a siege so fiercely pressed or so staunchly resisted . A mine brought down one tower but it was starvation that forced the defenders  surrender.  In his anger,  says Wendover, John  ordered all the nobles to be hung , but was persuaded against this by a military adviser who warned of reprisals. A small advanced French force arrived in London in November, grumbling that the lack of wine meant that they had to drink English beer. Meanwhile, the rebels  ally in Scotland, King Alexander II, went on the warpath. At the end of December, John led his army on a ravaging expedition north, causing the devastation described in the opening quote. He burned Berwick before returning south, seemingly triumphant. Ralph Coggeshall writes of John s troops:  They made great slaughter, as they did everywhere they went . However London remained in rebel hands. Militarily and politically, John made a major mistake in avoiding dealing with the most serious threat. Louis was able to reinforce the London garrison and on 21 May he launched a full-scale invasion force, landing unopposed on the Isle of Thanet (in Kent). Rochester was quickly retaken, and royalist forces were pushed westwards as Louis took control of the south. Sensing the new momentum, leading royalist barons went over to the rebel side, including one of John s foremost generals, his half-brother William Longsword. Pockets of royalist resistance held out at Windsor, and, vitally, Dover. In the huge southern forest of the Weald, William of Kensham ( Willikin ) led bands of archers in guerrilla attacks on the French. But Louis and the rebels swiftly established control of about one-third of England. By the end of the summer, two-thirds of the baronage had declared for Louis. John dies, royalists rally Alexander II was able to progress from Scotland all the way to Dover where, in September, he paid homage to Louis, king of England in all but name. Just as it seemed England might be about to undergo a second foreign conquest 150 years after the fi rst in 1066, everything changed in a moment. On 19 October, having contracted dysentery, John performed his best service to the protection of the country: he died. This transformed the situation. The grievances against John could not be laid at the door of his unblemished heir, the nine-year-old Henry III. And so, under the protection of the elderly William Marshal as regent, the royalists rallied the English  to defend our land  against the French invaders, who had not helped their cause by their arrogant behaviour and expectations of landed spoils. Once again, the flow reversed to the royalists. A period of intermittent warfare and truces followed until the spring. On 20 May 1217, rebel and French forces were fi nally broken at the siege of Lincoln. Those who suffered in the war took their revenge on the French who attempted to flee back to London. Wendover records: Many of them, especially the foot-soldiers, were slain before they got to Louis; for the inhabitants of the towns through which they passed in their flight went to meet them with swords and clubs, and, laying ambushes for them, killed many. Hemmed up in London, the French now relied on reinforcements from France. These were dispatched in a major fleet that was met by an English naval force off Sandwich on 24 August. Displaying their superior skills, the English, using the wind direction to blind their enemies with lime dust, annihilated the French and beheaded their commander, the mercenary Eustace the Monk, on the deck of his flagship. It was the most important English naval victory until the Spanish Armada in 1588. On hearing of this defeat, Louis, says the Dunstable annalist, went mad with grief and rage and then,  destitute of present aid and despairing of the future , he sought peace terms. These were granted at Kingston on 12 September, marking the official ending of the war. Louis was back in France before the end of the month. Louis  involvement in the baronial revolt might well have led him to being crowned Louis I of England, but his luck ran out when John died. He was also hampered by the fact that he was a foreigner. Resentment of French troops in England grew throughout the course of the war   just as the barons had resented the presence of John s foreign mercenaries. As a result, England emerged with a strengthened sense of national identity. More importantly for its people, shocked by the impact of invasion, the rest of the century was to be relatively peaceful. The blame for the war itself can be fairly laid on John s incompetent shoulders. Contemporaries were certainly not inclined to exculpate him, as this rhyme demonstrates: With John s foul deeds England s whole realm is stinking, As Hell is, too, where he is now sinking. John s battles with the barons, French and Scots: a timeline June 1204: The French seize Normandy Philip Augustus of France s campaign to annex Normandy succeeds with the fall of Rouen. He also makes gains at John s expense in Anjou and Poitou. John s need to recover his landsleads to increasingly heavy taxation in England. July 1214: John s French campaign fails John s grand campaign in France collapses when his allies are defeated by Philip at Bouvines. John returns to England in October where baronial discontent has been heightened by a heavy scutage levy. May 1215: The barons revolt against John The barons, led by Robert fitz Walter, renounce their homage to the king. The revolt begins with military operations at Northampton. The rebels soon take London. June 1215: John agrees to sign Magna Carta John seals Magna Carta at Runnymede. A council of 25 barons is formed to monitor John s adherence to the agreement. December 1215: John ravages southern Scotland Alexander II of Scotland invades northern England. John leads a ravaging expedition north and sacks Berwick. 21 May 1216: A French army lands in Kent Prince Louis of France arrives in Kent with his main invasion force. Summer 1216: The siege of Dover begins Dover Castle was a crucial element in England s medieval defensive network. Matthew Paris called it,  The key to England . Prince Louis of France himself took personal charge of most of the military operations there, beginning the siege of royalist forces on in the summer of 1216. Drawing up his war engines, one of which was labelled  Evil Neighbour , he unleashed a heavy bombardment against the castle s walls, taking the north-western barbican and setting a mine. Dover was heavily garrisoned under the defiant leadership of Hubert de Burgh. The spirited defence pushed the French back, forcing them to withdraw their siege machines to a safer distance. Louis then applied psychological pressure by taunting the defenders with food, threatening starvation  to strike terror into them . With the defenders still defiant in October, Louis tried a new strategy: lifting the siege, he focused instead on  reducing the smaller castles throughout the country . Following a truce, Louis restarted a short siege on 12 May 1217. But on hearing of the major defeat of his forces on 20 May at Lincoln, he left for London. Dover s stand proved disastrous for Louis: it forced him to hold back troops from Lincoln and it provided a significant proportion of the fleet that defeated the French at Sandwich. 19 October 1216: John succumbs to dysentery Much of John s baggage train is lost in the Wash. John dies in Newark Castle and the nine-year-old Henry III is proclaimed king, with William Marshal acting as regent. 20 May 1217: The French are routed French and rebel forces are decisively defeated at Lincoln by William Marshal. French troops are attacked on their way back to their stronghold in London. 24 August 1217: The English destroy a French fleet The French fleet bringing reinforcements is comprehensively destroyed off Sandwich. Louis sues for peace. 12 September 1217: Louis leaves England The treaty of Kingston ends the war. An amnesty is declared for the rebels. Louis is paid 10,000 marks to quit England.

        "target_summary": "\"The whole land was covered with these limbs of the devil like locusts,\" wrote Roger of Wendover, starkly capturing the brutal devastation unleashed by King John's troops during England's bitter civil war in the winter of 1215-16. This tumultuous, yet often overlooked, period was far more than a mere conflict; it was a crucible that forged Magna Carta, witnessed a profound French invasion, almost a second Norman Conquest, a pivotal English naval victory, and the very emergence of English national identity. Indeed, it even holds the potential prototype for the legend of Robin Hood.\n\nKing John, perpetually enshrined in popular memory as \"Bad King John,\" earned his ignominious reputation through a reign marked by consistent incompetence and flagrant abuses of power. Contemporary chroniclers echoed this sentiment, painting him as \"nature's enemy,\" a \"pillager of his own people,\" and a \"raging madman.\" From his coronation in 1199, John's actions consistently alienated his subjects. His alleged murder of his nephew Arthur of Brittany in 1202 and harsh treatment of prisoners incensed powerful Norman lords. His \"fitful and ineffective\" defense of his continental holdings led to the French conquest of Normandy by 1204, a humiliating loss that he vainly boasted he would reclaim.\n\nThis ambition, however, served as the catalyst for widespread discontent. John relentlessly \"put the screws on England\" to fund his lost pride and territories. Royal income soared as he exploited every revenue stream, even capitalizing on a papal interdict to plunder church wealth. More damagingly, his arbitrary rule and lecherous behavior at court, including the infamous starvation of a royal debtor's family in 1210 and accusations of serial seduction, created a climate of fear and resentment among the baronage. The final provocation came with a record scutage levy for his disastrous 1214 French campaign, solidifying his reputation as \"Softsword\" – a king not worth fighting for.\n\nBy May 1215, the long-gestating rebellion erupted. Under the banner of \"the Army of God,\" barons renounced their homage and quickly seized the vital power base of London, alongside other key towns, turning the tide against the king. Cornered, John met the rebels at Runnymede in mid-June, where he sealed Magna Carta. This monumental charter demanded protections for free men against illegal imprisonment and property seizure, guaranteed swift justice, and sought limitations on scutage, effectively establishing a monitoring committee of 25 barons with the unprecedented right to wage war on the king if he failed to uphold the agreement. Yet, John, merely buying time, never intended to honor it.\n\nThe fragile truce shattered in September. With papal condemnation of Magna Carta in hand, John faced a new threat: the barons had allied with Prince Louis of France, offering him the English crown. Louis, a descendant of Henry II, accepted, embarking on what almost became a second Norman Conquest. While John's forces initially triumphed at the fierce siege of Rochester Castle, Louis's full-scale invasion in May 1216 saw him land unopposed, swiftly retake Rochester, and push royalist forces west. Many leading barons, including John's own half-brother, William Longsword, defected, leading to Louis's control over about a third of England. Crucial pockets of royalist resistance, notably the unyielding garrison at Dover Castle under Hubert de Burgh, nevertheless held out, proving strategically vital.\n\nThen, everything changed. On October 19, 1216, King John, ravaged by dysentery, died. His demise transformed the conflict, as grievances against the hated monarch could not be laid at the feet of his innocent nine-year-old heir, Henry III. Under the sagacious leadership of Regent William Marshal, the royalists rallied the English populace \"to defend our land\" against the French invaders, whose arrogant behavior had alienated the very people they sought to rule.\n\nThe momentum irrevocably shifted. A period of skirmishes culminated in two decisive English triumphs in 1217. On May 20, French and rebel forces were routed at the Battle of Lincoln, with fleeing French troops brutally attacked by vengeful locals. Just three months later, on August 24, an English fleet, displaying superior naval skill and ingenuity (even employing blinding lime dust), annihilated French reinforcements off Sandwich, beheading their commander. Faced with such overwhelming defeats, Louis \"went mad with grief and rage,\" then, \"destitute of present aid and despairing of the future,\" sought peace. The Treaty of Kingston in September officially ended the war, and Louis left England.\n\nThis dramatic saga cemented a strengthened sense of English national identity, forged in resentment of foreign intervention. The blame for the devastating war, as contemporaries universally agreed, lay squarely on John's \"incompetent shoulders,\" paving the way for a century of relative peace after his reign of turmoil.",

        "title": "Did Henry VIII love his last wife Katherine Parr?",
        "content": "On 12 July 1543, as plague began to take hold in London, two dozen guests crammed into a small chapel at Hampton Court to see Henry VIII marry for the sixth time. The wedding, a low-key affair, took the diplomatic community in London by surprise. Ad It was noted that  the king espoused the queen privately and without ceremony . The bridegroom was, however, enthusiastic as he took his vows  with a joyful countenance . Henry was 52 years old and ailing. His new wife, Katherine Parr, was not quite 31, twice-widowed and an experienced stepmother. Surely this was a marriage born of common sense, where passion would play little part? The Victorians depicted it as the union of an irascible tyrant with a worthy matron. The truth, however, was very different. Henry was looking for a wife, not a nurse or homemaker. He wanted a companion for his bed who might provide further heirs and could carry the role of queen consort impressively. Katherine, who had given up another man to marry the king, was well aware that her duties would definitely run to more than polite conversation and soothing the royal brow. Her determination to be a success led to a deep bond of affection between the royal couple which may, in 1546, have saved her life. It is not surprising that Henry was drawn to the comely widow. She was a slim, attractive redhead whose unimpeachable reputation hid a sensual nature. Her other suitor, Sir Thomas Seymour (the king s brother-in-law), had already realised this and probably Henry did, too. Until now, the curtains around the marriage bed of Henry VIII and his last wife have remained firmly closed. Yet theirs was undoubtedly a sexual relationship. Katherine took seriously her vows to be  bonaire and buxom in bed and in board . She took milk baths to keep her skin soft and the day after her wedding, she ordered  fine perfumes  for her bedchamber at Hampton Court. She was clearly determined to make her body and her bedchamber as enticing as possible. Henry lumbering into view in his nightshirt must have been a daunting sight. A year before his final marriage it had been noted that he was  already very stout and daily growing heavier  three of the biggest men to be found could get inside his doublet . Pain and the disease in his legs had left their mark on him. Between 1543 and 1545 he got through 300 pairs of hose a year. This was the man that Katherine had taken as her third husband. Very soon he doted on her   but could she possibly have loved him? At the outset, almost certainly not. She married him for the advancement of her family and because he could not be refused. She was dutiful and keen to convince herself that her fate was God s will. Yet Katherine was also a loving and optimistic woman, as well as intelligent. She knew the opportunity that had come her way and thought hard about how to turn it to her advantage. Developing a good relationship with all three of the royal children was certainly important but at the heart of Katherine s strategy was the king himself. Henry was not simply an overweight monster but a lonely and unhappy man after the disaster of his marriage to the foolish Catherine Howard. Katherine Parr recognised his need for love and attention. Circumstances permitted her to establish herself swiftly as a major influence in his life, as the plague kept them continuously outside the capital and in each other s company for six months. It was an ideal foundation for their relationship. So the king showered her with jewels and beautiful clothes, entrusted the country to her regency while he fought the French one last time in 1544, and greatly hoped for children with her. Henry and Katherine shared many interests, from hunting and archery to music, masques and books. She was a graceful dancer and they both loved the Venetian Bassano brothers, musicians patronised by Katherine. Henry, a cultured man, was delighted to have a queen who commanded respect from ambassadors and with whom he could discourse. Both husband and wife were committed to the 16th-century belief in lifelong learning. Katherine brushed up her Latin and also began to edit and write religious books, as her commitment to advancing the cause of further reform grew. In 1545 she became the first queen of England to be published when copies of her Prayers or Meditations were produced by the king s printers. Her influence over Henry seemed unshakeable. But in 1546, the last full year of the king s life, Katherine s position came under threat. Henry s health declined alarmingly and the negative attributes of his personality, his capriciousness, cunning and imperiousness, were amplified by the reluctant acknowledgement of his own mortality. A power struggle for the future of England was fought out over his diseased frame and his loyal wife, who had felt secure in his affection and returned it with devotion, found herself at the centre of the struggle. A bitter fight The story of plots against the queen was recounted dramatically by John Foxe nearly two decades later. By the time Foxe was writing, almost all of those who had been close to Katherine Parr were dead, so the detail cannot be verified. Katherine never spoke of such things herself. But it is certain that the bitter fight between the forces of religious reform and conservatism came close to Katherine. The ladies of her bedchamber were targeted in the search for banned books, and an outspoken reformer, Anne Askew, was tortured to get her to reveal links to those who served the queen. Anne was later burned at the stake without divulging anything. But Katherine hastily hid many items in her own book collection, changed locks on trunks and coffers and summoned her sick uncle to support her at this difficult time. Henry must have known his wife s views and interests. If Foxe is to be believed he found them progressively irritating, not so much for their content as for the fact that she presumed to contradict him in public. Nor had she conceived, and time was passing. Henry s tendency to become bored with his wives after a couple of years may also have been a factor. Yet whatever happened in the summer of 1546 did not destroy their marriage. Perhaps Henry did, as Foxe claimed, take a penitent Katherine on his knee and reassure her of his love. In fact, he seems to have been eager to make amends by ordering  all manner of jewels, pearls and precious stones  skins and sable furs  for our dearest wife, the queen . She, however, knew that her position had changed. After a second honeymoon in the autumn, they parted before Christmas. Henry needed to put his kingdom in order and prepare for death. There is no evidence that Katherine ever saw him again. Her New Year s gift to Prince Edward was a portrait of herself with his father, a telling clue that she hoped to cling on to the influence she had once enjoyed. Henry died on 28 January 1547. Katherine s hope that she would be made regent for the boy-king was dashed when Edward Seymour took power. In the spring of 1547 Katherine secretly wedded Edward s younger brother, Thomas, whom she certainly loved, though the pair hoped also to regain control of the royal children through their union. The marriage was stormy. Katherine suffered considerably during a difficult pregnancy as her husband flirted with Princess Elizabeth, who lived under her care. She died of childbed fever on 5 September 1548 after giving birth to her only child, a daughter. It was a tragic end for this remarkable woman, who had found that marriage to Henry VIII was perilous but brought great rewards. She set out to win his heart and amply succeeded.

        "target_summary": "Amidst the plague of July 1543, a small, discreet ceremony at Hampton Court saw a 52-year-old, ailing Henry VIII take his sixth wife, Katherine Parr, a 31-year-old twice-widowed woman, much to the surprise of London's diplomatic community. While many perceived this union as a practical, passionless arrangement for an \"irascible tyrant\" and a \"worthy matron,\" the truth was far more nuanced. Henry sought not just a nurse, but an impressive queen consort, a companion for his bed who might yet provide heirs. Katherine, in turn, was determined to succeed in her demanding role.\n\nKatherine was a striking figure—slim, attractive, with red hair and an unimpeachable reputation that belied a sensual nature, a fact recognized by both Henry and her previous suitor, Sir Thomas Seymour. Theirs was undoubtedly a sexual relationship, with Katherine diligently taking milk baths and ordering \"fine perfumes\" to make her bedchamber enticing, despite Henry's increasingly stout and disease-ridden frame. While initially marrying for family advancement and out of necessity, the intelligent and optimistic Katherine strategically set out to win the king's heart. She recognized Henry's deep loneliness following the disastrous marriage to Catherine Howard. Fortuitously, six months spent together outside London due to the plague allowed their relationship to flourish, forming an \"ideal foundation.\"\n\nHenry soon doted on her, showering her with jewels and entrusting her with the regency during his French campaign in 1544. They discovered shared passions, from hunting and music to books and intellectual discourse. Katherine, a cultured woman who commanded respect, thrived in this environment, brushing up her Latin and becoming England's first published queen with her religious writings, steadily advancing the cause of reform. Her influence over Henry seemed unshakeable.\n\nHowever, in 1546, as Henry's health severely declined, his capriciousness and imperiousness intensified, casting Katherine's position into jeopardy. Caught in the bitter power struggle between religious reformers and conservatives, she found herself at the centre of plots, with her ladies and even the outspoken Anne Askew targeted. Though the details remain unverified, Katherine took immediate steps to secure her possessions and summon support. Henry, increasingly irritated by her public contradictions and the absence of an heir, may have grown bored. Yet, their marriage endured. He eventually made amends, showering her with gifts, and they shared a \"second honeymoon.\" Katherine, however, understood her precarious position had shifted. They parted before Christmas, Henry preparing for his death, and likely never saw each other again.\n\nAfter Henry's death in January 1547, Katherine's hopes for a regency were dashed. She secretly married Thomas Seymour, the man she truly loved, but their union proved stormy. A difficult pregnancy was overshadowed by Seymour's inappropriate flirtations with Princess Elizabeth, who lived under Katherine's care. Tragically, Katherine died of childbed fever in September 1548, shortly after giving birth to her only child, a daughter. It was a poignant end for a remarkable woman who, despite the perils of marriage to Henry VIII, had succeeded brilliantly in winning his affection and leaving a lasting mark.",

        "title": "Lady Jane Grey: why do we want to believe the myth?",
        "content": "The teenage queen, Lady Jane Grey, has been mythologised, even fetishised, as the innocent victim of adult ambition. The legend was encapsulated by the French Romantic artist Paul Delaroche in his 1833 historical portrait of Jane in white on the scaffold, an image with all the erotic overtones of a virgin sacrifice. But the legend also inspired a fraud, one that has fooled historians, art experts, and biographers, for over 100 years. Ad A 16th-century merchant gave us what was believed, until now, to be the only detailed, contemporary description of Jane s appearance. In a letter, he wrote an eyewitness account of a smiling, red-haired girl, being processed to the Tower as queen, on 10 July 1553. He was close enough to see that she was so small she had to wear stacked shoes or  chopines  to give her height. Jane was overthrown nine days later, and, eventually, executed in the Tower from where she had reigned. But while the tragedy of her brutal death, at only 16, is real, the letter is an invention that obscures the significance of her reign. The faked letter first made its appearance in Richard Patrick Boyle Davey s 1909 biography The Nine Days Queen, Lady Jane Grey & her Times. Davey s subject was already a popular one. The Victorians had lapped up the poignant tale of a child-woman forced to be queen, and despite this, later executed as a usurper. The letter,  discovered  by Davey in the archives of Genoa, seemingly brought this tragic heroine to life. But in retrospect that should have sent alarm bells ringing, for the Jane the Victorians knew was already heavily fictionalised. The historical Jane was a great grandchild of Henry VII. Highly intelligent and given a top flight Protestant education, she might have made a queen consort to her fiercely Protestant cousin Edward VI, as her father hoped. But instead, on 6 July 1553, the dying Edward bequeathed her the throne, in place of his Catholic half sister, Mary Tudor. Mary overthrew Jane 13 days later, and she was duly tried for treason, found guilty and condemned. Mary indicated she wished to pardon Jane. But Jane was executed, nevertheless, the following year. It was the aftermath to a rebellion in which she had played no part (although her father had). Why then did Mary sign Jane s death warrant? The reason was indicated the day before Jane s beheading. The bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, reminded Mary it was leading Protestants who had opposed her rule in July 1553, and in the recent rebellion. Jane, who had condemned Catholicism as queen, had continued to do so as a prisoner in the Tower. As such she posed a threat. It was for her religious stance that Jane would die, not solely for her father s actions, or her reign as a usurper. Aware that the Protestant cause would be damaged by its link to treason, Jane reminded people from the scaffold that while in law she was a traitor, she had merely accepted the throne she was offered, and was innocent of having sought it. From this kernel of truth the later image of Jane was spun. Protestant propagandists developed her claims to innocence, ascribing the events of 1553 to the personal ambitions of Jane s father and father-in-law, rather than religion. Under Queen Elizabeth, treason was associated with Catholics, not Protestants, and the earlier history was forgotten. The religious issue of 1553 concluded only in 1701, when it was made illegal for any Catholic to inherit the throne: a law that still stands. But Jane s story continued to develop. Her  innocence  was associated increasingly with the passivity deemed appropriate in a young girl. The sexual dimension to this is evident in Edward s Young s 1714 poem, The Force of Religion, which invited men to gaze as voyeurs on the pure Jane in her  private closet . Jane s mother, Frances, meanwhile, was reinvented as a wicked queen to Jane s Snow White. By the 19th century Jane s fictionalised life was enormously popular. But there was something still missing from her story: a face. With no contemporary images or descriptions, the public had to be content with Jane as imagined by artists. The most striking work remains Paul Delaroche s portrait, The Execution of Lady Jane Grey, bequeathed to the nation by Lord Cheylesmore in 1902 (and now part of a major exhibition at the National Gallery). Jane, blindfold, and feeling for the block, represents an apotheosis of female helplessness. Richard Davey seems to have spotted a need for an account of Jane s appearance that matches its power. He claimed to have found it in a letter in Genoa, composed by the merchant,  Sir Baptist Spinola . The letter has been quoted in biographies ever since and used to argue the merits of  lost  portraits of Jane. But I was concerned that Davey was the sole source for this letter. Researching my triple biography, The Sisters Who Would be Queen, I had discovered that Davey had invented evidence that Jane had a nanny and dresser with her in the Tower: characters inspired by earlier novels. I began a long search for the  Spinola  letter, but never found it in Genoa or in any history predating 1909. And it became clear the letter is a fake that mixes details from contemporary sources with fiction. There was a contemporary merchant called Benedict Spinola and a soldier called Baptista Spinola. The description of Jane has echoes of the red-lipped girl in the Delaroche portrait, but resembles also a contemporary description of Mary Tudor, who was  of low stature  very thin; and her hair reddish . Jane s mother carries her train in the letter, as was observed in 1553. The platform shoes or  chopines  were taken from the Victorian historian Agnes Strickland, quoting Isaac D Israeli. I can find no earlier source. But they are suggestive of Jane s physical vulnerability: an element in the appeal of the abused child woman that remains so popular (we even find Jane raped in a recent novel). The rest of Jane s dress, described by Spinola as a gown of green velvet worn with a white headdress, was in colours traditionally worn by a monarch on the eve of their coronation. But they are also the colours of the illustration, Lady Jane Grey in Royal Robes, published in Ardern Holt s 1882 Fancy Dresses Described. Significantly, in Davey s The Tower of London, published in 1910, he describes Jane s dress as edged in ermine, as it was in Holt s illustration: a detail overlooked by  Sir Baptist Spinola . Davey s lies and the repetition of old myths are damaging. Because Jane s reign was treated for so long as the product of the ambitions of a few men, or of Edward VI s na ve hopes, it is regarded as a brief hiatus, of no consequence. But it is key to understanding the development of our constitutional history. And we have overlooked something else. The Tudor unease with women who hold power has never really gone away. In legend Jane is the good girl: weak and feminine; Frances is a bad woman: powerful and mannish. This is the lesson of the myths   one that historians have too willingly accepted. Leanda de Lisle is a bestselling author. Her book The Sisters Who Would be Queen is out now. Ad This article was first published in the March 2010 issue of BBC History Magazine",
        "target_summary": "Lady Jane Grey, the teenage queen, has been profoundly mythologized as an innocent victim of adult ambition, a perception powerfully solidified by Paul Delaroche's iconic 1833 painting depicting her sacrificial execution. This poignant legend, widely embraced by Victorians, was, however, tragically undermined by a century-long historical fraud. Richard Patrick Boyle Davey's 1909 biography, *The Nine Days Queen*, introduced a supposedly contemporary letter from a merchant, \"Sir Baptist Spinola,\" detailing Jane's appearance as a smiling, red-haired girl so diminutive she required stacked shoes to gain height. This vivid account, allegedly \"discovered\" by Davey, has been uncritically accepted, despite feeding into an already heavily fictionalized narrative of Jane.\n\nThe true historical Jane was a highly intelligent, fiercely Protestant great-grandchild of Henry VII, bequeathed the throne at 16 by her dying cousin, Edward VI, to prevent Catholic Mary Tudor's succession. While she reigned briefly, her execution by Mary was not solely for usurpation or her father's rebellion, but crucially, for her unwavering Protestant convictions. Jane's continued condemnation of Catholicism, even as a prisoner, posed a significant threat to Mary's Catholic reign. From the scaffold, Jane claimed she had merely accepted the throne, a \"kernel of truth\" later amplified by Protestant propagandists. These narratives downplayed her religious agency, attributing her fate to the ambitions of men and increasingly associating her \"innocence\" with a passive, feminine ideal, even reinventing her mother as a \"wicked queen.\"\n\nThe author, Leanda de Lisle, during her own historical research, discovered Davey's pattern of inventing historical details. Her exhaustive search for the \"Spinola\" letter proved fruitless, confirming it as a meticulous fabrication. Davey had cunningly woven together elements from diverse, non-contemporary sources: the \"red-lipped\" girl hinted at Delaroche's painting; her \"low stature\" from a description of Mary Tudor; and the \"chopines\" from a Victorian historian. Even the specific green velvet gown and white headdress described by \"Spinola\" mirrored an 1882 fashion illustration.\n\nThe perpetuation of this elaborate fraud and the romantic myths it supports are deeply damaging. By portraying Jane's reign as a mere consequence of others' ambitions, her pivotal role in constitutional history has been overlooked. Moreover, these myths reinforce outdated and harmful gender archetypes: Jane as the \"good girl,\" weak and feminine, contrasted with powerful, \"mannish\" women. Challenging these ingrained fictions is essential not only for a more accurate understanding of Tudor history but also for confronting persistent societal biases against women in power.",

Rex sees the flattery of Elizabeth s courtiers as perpetuated too often by modern historians. He argues that she showed a sustained aversion to matrimony, coldly entering into marriage negotiations to enhance her prominence on the European stage. She is repeatedly castigated for making no provision for the succession, thereby ignoring her financial support for James VI after 1586 and their personal correspondence. Rex denounces her as crueller than her half-sister Mary (who burned more than 300 Protestants), since after the northern rebellion of 1569 70, some 450 men were executed, and from the 1580s, Catholic priests caught entering England clandestinely were hanged, drawn and quartered. He rejects the vital Tudor distinction between religious nonconformity, and rebellion or active sedition, since  the victims were just as dead .

        "title": "8 little-known prehistoric sites in Britain",
        "content": "Britain is blessed with some truly magnificent ancient sites. Every year tourists flock to the great megaliths of Stonehenge and Avebury in Wiltshire, the Callanish Stones in the Hebrides and Castlerigg in the Lake District. However, the prehistory in Britain goes back far longer and is far more diverse than these well-visited monuments may suggest. Author and explorer Dave Hamilton looks at some of the lesser-known ancient sites around Britain; from a Palaeolithic cave burial and an ancient axe-polishing stone to a towering broch and site of prehistoric rock art. Ad King Arthur s Hall, St Breward, Cornwall In a desolate, windswept corner of Bodmin Moor, in the shadow of Cornwall s highest peaks, an unusual rectangular configuration of 56 stones set in a manmade bank of earth lies open to the elements. The site has been known as King Arthur s Hall since the 16th century but it is doubtful it ever had anything to do with any figure connected to the legendary monarch. It is thought there were once up to 140 stones, first erected in the Neolithic period   although beyond that, its purpose remains a mystery. It has been suggested it might have been a meeting point for tribal elders, who would gather within the rectangular interior of the upright stones. Similar sites in France and Ireland were used for cremation and it is possible King Arthur s Hall served the same function. However, there is no direct archaeological evidence to back this claim. Some have even suggested that it is not Neolithic at all but a medieval cattle enclosure.  | Stonehenge: a prehistoric tourist trap The consensus seems to be that it is at least 4,500 years old and probably served some sort of ritual purpose   although this is often shorthand for  we don t really know ! It does seem to be one small piece of a larger landscape of sites, with associated stone circles; cists (stone coffin or burial chamber) and monoliths dotted around the surrounding moor. The climate on the moor can be unforgiving, so the centre of the site is often flooded and boggy. Nevertheless it is a magical place to visit and quite unlike any other ancient monument in the country. The site has been known as King Arthur s Hall since the 16th century. (Image by Alamy) The Grey Wethers and the Polisher Stone, Avebury, Wiltshire On Fyfield Down, just off the Ridgeway path near Avebury in Wiltshire, there is a large field containing hundreds of glacial deposited stones. It is a spectacular site, often known as the Grey Wethers (but also known as Mother s Jam), as from a distance the grey sarsen stones resemble countless grazing sheep. Not to be confused with the Dartmoor stone circle of the same name, these rocks provided easily accessible building material for the Neolithic people who erected the great stone circles of Avebury and the Long barrow at West Kennet. Among the deposited sarsens, one stone particularly stands out (if you can find it!): the  Polisher Stone . A series of grooves were carved into this recumbent stone by generations of people polishing their stone axes. Stones marked in this way are a common sight in France but are much rarer in Britain. Polished axes were traded throughout ancient Britain and it is thought most were never used for cutting down trees or any other practical purpose. Instead, current thinking is they were both a status symbol for Neolithic man (akin to the modern-day Swiss watch), and an item of ritualistic practice, perhaps like a ceremonial mace. From a distance the grey sarsen stones resemble countless grazing sheep. (Image by Alamy) Although we will never know for certain, the Polisher Stone s proximity to the ancient Ridgeway path might suggest the rock formed part of a ritualised walk toward the end of the pilgrimage to Avebury during the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age. Look for the stone on the hill between the main field of Sarsens and the Ridgeway path, or see my book, Wild Ruins B.C. (Wild Things Publishing, 2019) for more detailed instructions. Paviland Cave, Gower, South Wales Around 33,000 years ago the body of a man was placed into a cave that overlooked a vast, flat plain of grazing mammoths, deer and antelope. Around his neck were shell necklaces and on his wrists were rings made from mammoth bone. The funeral party may have covered his body with red ochre, or he may have been laid to rest in clothing dyed with the pigment. The man would have been in his 20s and, although perhaps a little larger, physically he would have been no different to you or me. He was part of an upper-Palaeolithic group of people known as Cro-Magnons   modern humans, who followed on from, and perhaps crossed over with, Neanderthals, appearing in Europe 40,000 years ago. Significantly, he was buried with grave goods and a mammoth skull was placed, like a headstone, above the body, making this the oldest ritualised burial ever found in Britain. We cannot know how the man died but the presence of the ochre and jewellery, along with the mammoth skull, have led some to believe he was either a shaman or celebrated hunter. A view looking out of the Paviland Cave, Gower Peninsula, Wales. (Image by Alamy) Thousands of years later, long after his body had decomposed, the ochre remained, staining his bones red. In 1823 the remains were discovered by the theologian and geologist William Buckland. The staining of the bones along with its proximity to a Roman camp, led him to believe these were the bones of a female, Roman-era prostitute, living in isolation to solicit her trade. With a belief system centred around the teachings of the Bible, much like his peers at the time, Buckland simply could not have contemplated the true age of the skeleton. To further fit this view, he suggested the  woman s  mammoth bone jewellery was fossilised ivory dug up by her kinsmen. Because of this gender confusion and the red-stained bones, he came to be known as 'The Red Lady of Paviland'.  about life in the Iron Age Sea levels are much higher today than they were in Palaeolithic and the cave now stands on the shores of the Gower Peninsula. Although the cave is well documented, it can be difficult to find and is a treacherous place to get to. A visit needs to be timed with the retreating tides, as many have found themselves cut off from land, forced to spend the night in the cave! Thornborough Henges, near Thornborough, North Yorkshire A series of three, 240-metre diameter henge circles, 1,000 paces apart, the Thornborough Henges would have been constructed with nothing more than antler and bone tools and signifies many thousands of hours of labour. The central henge of the three would have been covered in gypsum, which glowed a brilliant white both in daylight and under the glow of the full moon. As with all Neolithic sites, we cannot know its true purpose, but it is thought to have astrological significance, being linked with the rising of Orion s Belt in the night sky. This may have seen the henge (or henges) used for ceremonies during key times of the year. Whatever its purpose, it did not sit alone in the landscape. An associated cursus (or large dug out), ceremonial walkway and six henge circles have also been found in the local area, along with countless burial mounds. Such is the extent of the site, it must have rivalled Stonehenge for its importance to the people of the Neolithic period and it is likely people came to visit from far and wide. Two of the henge circles are found on open grassland with a third   the most atmospheric   now hidden amongst a large grove of trees. Midhowe Broch, Orkney Islands, Scotland The Scottish brochs were large towers thought to have once housed elite tribesmen along with their families, and perhaps even their animals. Situated mostly in the north of mainland Scotland   the Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetlands   they look like modern-day cooling towers. Midhowe itself is one of many brochs densely packed on the shores of Eynhallow Sound   the stretch of water which separates the island of Rousay from Orkney mainland. Its strategic location and the presence of holes, through which spears can be thrust, suggests it was used for defensive purposes. However, just as with the hillforts to the south, these may have been used as a mark of status or a show of power, rather than serving solely as a stronghold. The completeness of Midhowe Broch gives a remarkable insight into life during the Scottish Iron Age. (Image by Alamy) Despite the remote, northern location of Midhowe, Roman artefacts have been found on the site, suggesting direct or indirect trading links with the Roman Empire. Around a third of the defensive wall still stands, along with stairs; proposed kennels for guard dogs either side of the entrance; flagstone furniture and even a working water cistern. The completeness of the broch gives a remarkable insight into life during the Scottish Iron Age. Ballochmyle rock art, Scotland Tucked away in a small woodland, just off the river Ayr, about 10 miles due east of Prestwick and 25 miles southwest of Glasgow, lies one of the most enigmatic prehistoric sites in Britain. Etched into a large outcrop of red sandstone are some of the most extensive examples of rock art made by a pre-Christian civilisation found in Britain. Thought to date to the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age, the markings are referred to as  cup and ring marks , as they often show a series of rings emanating from a cup-like indentation. They can be found elsewhere in Scotland, Northern England, Ireland and continental Europe, with similar markings also found in Australia and Mesoamerica. During the Neolithic and early Bronze Age, rivers would have been an important way to navigate through a sometimes densely-populated area. The proximity of the Ballochmyle rock art to the river therefore could suggest these were way-markers or etchings made to appease the river gods to grant their safe passage. Others say they could have been signposts for lost travellers, star-charts, or even an ancient form of writing. The Devil s Ring and Finger, Midlands, England It is rare to find Neolithic monuments of any kind in the Midlands, let alone one like the Devil s Ring and Finger. It is one of only a handful of circular stones found in Britain and Ireland. It contains perhaps the largest carved hole of any prehistoric monument in the country, much larger than the far more famous M n-an-Tol in Cornwall. However, unlike its Cornish counterpart, the Devil s Ring and Finger has only one, rather than two associated monoliths, in addition to the circular stone   hence the name ring and finger. However, as the monument was removed from its original site some time in antiquity to make way for the plough, we can never really know what the original configuration looked like, or indeed what it was for. It has been suggested that it may have been part of a stone circle or the only surviving part of a chambered tomb, much like Cotswold Severn family tombs south of the site. The monument now lies on the edge of a farmer s field and in all but the winter months is almost completely obscured from view by a small copse of trees and crop growth. The present owner of the farm tolerates walkers visiting the site   as long as they respect his crops and livestock by sticking to the field boundary. Borvemore, Isle of Harris, Scotland Also known as Scarista, the Borvemore standing stone sits on a wild, windswept, Hebridean headland between two long, often deserted, white sandy beaches. Below the stone, the azure blue waters which wash onto the beach are some of the most unpolluted in the world. At times, if it wasn t for the changeable climate, you could be fooled into thinking you were in the Seychelles rather than Scotland. It is likely that the stone was not erected as a monolith, and was instead part of a larger stone circle. There are signs of others in the area and it may be that Borvemore was once part of a much larger ritualist landscape. We know from climate surveys that when the stone was erected the weather was far more favourable than it is today. With this in mind, it is not difficult to see why ancient people would have favoured a life on these idyllic islands. Ad Dave Hamilton is the author of Wild Ruins B.C.: the explorer s guide to Britain s ancient sites (Wild Things Publishing, 2019), which reveals Britain s extraordinary ancient history, from 10,000 years ago to the birth of Christ.

Author and explorer Dave Hamilton invites us on a journey to uncover these lesser-known wonders, from primeval burials to mysterious rock art, revealing a past shrouded in deep time and enduring enigma.\n\nIn a desolate corner of Cornwall's Bodmin Moor, the enigmatic King Arthur's Hall lies open to the elements. This unusual rectangular arrangement of 56 stones, set within a man-made earth bank, dates back to the Neolithic period. Though its purpose remains a mystery, it is speculated to have been a significant tribal meeting point or a cremation site, its origins still fiercely debated, some even suggesting it as a medieval cattle enclosure.\n\nWiltshire's Fyfield Down presents the spectacular sight of the 'Grey Wethers' – hundreds of glacial sarsen stones resembling a vast flock of grazing sheep. Among these lie the captivating 'Polisher Stone,' bearing deep grooves where generations of Neolithic people polished their stone axes. These finely crafted axes were not merely tools, but powerful status symbols or ritual objects, suggesting the site, near the ancient Ridgeway path, may have formed part of a ritual pilgrimage to Avebury.\n\nDeep within South Wales, Paviland Cave holds Britain's most ancient ritualized burial. Around 33,000 years ago, a young man was interred here, adorned with shell necklaces, mammoth bone rings, and stained with red ochre. A mammoth skull solemnly marked his grave, hinting at his revered status as a shaman or celebrated hunter. Tragically misidentified in the 19th century as \"The Red Lady,\" this Palaeolithic grave offers a profound connection to our earliest ancestors.\n\nNorth Yorkshire proudly hosts the Thornborough Henges, a series of three colossal, 240-metre diameter henge circles. Constructed with astonishing ingenuity using only antler and bone tools, the central henge once glowed brilliant white with gypsum, possibly linked to the rising of Orion's Belt. This monumental Neolithic complex, part of a larger ceremonial landscape, undoubtedly rivaled Stonehenge in its significance, drawing people from far and wide for grand rituals.\n\nOn the windswept Orkney Islands, the remarkably complete Midhowe Broch provides an extraordinary window into Scottish Iron Age life. This towering structure, once a stronghold for elite tribesmen and their families, reveals defensive features like spear-thrusting holes, along with surprisingly preserved stairs, flagstone furniture, and a working water cistern. The presence of Roman artifacts also speaks to ancient trade connections reaching even these remote northern shores.\n\nScotland's Ballochmyle unveils some of Britain's most extensive prehistoric rock art, etched into a large outcrop of red sandstone. These mesmerizing 'cup and ring marks,' dating to the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age, are a profound enigma. Situated near a river, they might have served as ancient way-markers, appeased river deities, or even represented an early, forgotten form of writing, their meaning lost to the mists of time.\n\nA rare Neolithic treasure in the English Midlands, the Devil's Ring and Finger features a circular stone with perhaps the largest carved hole of any prehistoric monument in the country, accompanied by a single monolith. Though relocated in antiquity, its original configuration and purpose – possibly part of a grander stone circle or a chambered tomb – remains a captivating puzzle, often hidden by the changing seasons in a farmer's field.\n\nFinally, on the wild, azure shores of the Isle of Harris, the Borvemore standing stone stands as a solitary sentinel. Likely once part of a larger stone circle, erected during a more favorable ancient climate, it evokes the spiritual connection early inhabitants had with these idyllic Hebridean islands, hinting at a ritual landscape long since reclaimed by nature.\n\nThese remarkable sites, explored in Dave Hamilton's *Wild Ruins B.C.*, offer compelling glimpses into Britain's extraordinary ancient past, from its earliest human inhabitants to the dawn of the Christian era.",

Ad Henry apparently had little trouble in believing the rumours, but was there any truth behind them? Almost certainly not. Although Anne was a notorious flirt and loved to surround herself with attractive male courtiers, she was far too intelligent, shrewd and ambitious to risk throwing away everything that she had striven for during the long years of her courtship with Henry VIII. Her downfall was more likely due to the machinations of her enemies, in particular Thomas Cromwell, who quietly gathered  evidence  of her misdemeanours.

        "content": "This article was first published in the May 2012 issue of BBC History Magazine Ad On Sunday 3 June 2012, the celebrations of the Queen s diamond jubilee will culminate in a spectacular pageant on the Thames. Hundreds of vessels will take part in a massive procession, journeying down the river from Hammersmith to Greenwich. Ranging from a new royal barge and the little ships of Dunkirk to steamboats and a host of pleasure craft, the pageant is designed to embody symbols of nation and Commonwealth to mark this most historic occasion. Only once before in British history has a monarch achieved such an anniversary and that was Queen Victoria 115 years ago. But why will Britain celebrate the jubilee with a flotilla on the river rather than the more familiar marching bands, horse-drawn carriages and parade along the Mall? The answer lies, in part, with the long royal association with, and use of, the Thames. By the Tudor period, the Thames was the most convenient means of communication between a series of major riverside residences: Windsor, Hampton Court, Richmond, Westminster, Whitehall and Greenwich. It was also London s grandest  street , providing a majestic processional route for great royal, state and civic occasions. This was a role that none of the capital s narrow, crowded and rather mean highways could fulfil. During the reign of Henry VIII, the river witnessed a series of highly symbolic river processions. Three days before her coronation on 1 June 1533, Anne Boleyn left Greenwich Palace by barge in a fantastical river procession with an accompanying theatrical pageant organised around the theme of St George. A small barge led the parade carrying a mechanical dragon, which  pranced about furiously, twisting its tail and belching out wildfire . Henry commanded the lord mayor and the livery companies of the City of London to attend. Thomas Cramner, archbishop of Canterbury, reported that their barges were  decked after the most gorgeous and sumptuous manner , flying colourful flags and pennants. Guns saluted and musicians played as the heavily pregnant Anne, dressed in virginal white, was conveyed to the Tower of London in her  rich barge among her nobles . At the Tower she was met by Henry, who, in a very public display of affection, kissed his new bride. Anne later travelled to Westminster Abbey by road, while Henry went by river through his capital. Divisive issue These processions were, of course, stage-managed events allowing the public to demonstrate its loyalty to the king. But the coronation was not a straightforward affair. The annulment of Henry s marriage to Catherine of Aragon was a highly divisive issue and Anne was far from popular. The pageantry was, therefore, designed to lend legitimacy to the king s controversial new wife. The use of the broad and open expanse of the river allowed the maximum number of people to witness the event, and the involvement of the City of London and the nobility added further authority. Controversial marriages also posed difficulties for the Stuart monarchs. Once more, river processions provided an answer. Catherine of Braganza, queen consort to Charles II, had twin  disadvantages : she was foreign and a Roman Catholic. After her marriage to Charles in Portsmouth, she too made a grand state entry into London. Her  Aqua Triumphalis , a truly monumental pageant, was held on the Thames between Hampton Court and Whitehall on 23 August 1662. The writer John Evelyn was on the river:  I was spectator of the most magnificent triumph that ever floated on the Thames, considering the innumerable boates and vessells, dress d and adorn d with all imaginable pomp, but above all the thrones, arches, pageants, and other representations, stately barges of the Lord Maior and Companies, with various inventions, musiq and peales of ordnance from both ye vessells and the shore going to meete and conduct the Queene from Hampton Court to White-hall, at the first time of her coming to towne.  Samuel Pepys, who could not get a boat despite offering eight shillings, watched from the Banqueting House at Whitehall. He recorded in his diary that  the King and Queene [were] in a barge under a Canopy with 10,000 barges and boats I think, for we could see no water for them . But the real focus of Pepys s attention appears to have been Lady Castlemayne:  I glutted myself with looking on her.  Perhaps one of the strangest royal river processions took place on 4 April 1865, when the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, travelled down the Thames from Westminster to Crossness, then in north Kent. His purpose was the opening of the Crossness sewage pumping station, a major component of Joseph Bazalgette s massive scheme to improve London s sanitation. The event was attended by numerous influential guests, including the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London. The Prince of Wales officially switched on the four great sewage pumping engines, each of which was named after a member of the royal family: Victoria, Prince Consort, Albert Edward and Alexandra. Having declared open this  perfect shrine of machinery , the prince and the assembled dignitaries sat down to lunch in one of the outbuildings. The Victorian Thames was, however, very different from the pleasant river that played host to earlier spectacles. It was now urban, industrial, polluted and much altered by new bridges and the embankments. Consequently, its ceremonial use ebbed away. But one constant connecting late medieval London to the mid-Victorian metropolis was the Lord Mayor s Day procession, which took place on the Thames from 1453 until 1856. Each autumn, the newly elected mayor travelled, in a gilded barge accompanied by the great livery companies, from the City of London to be sworn in at the Exchequer Court in Westminster. This annual pageant was a symbolic display of the city s allegiance to the crown. It was also a boisterous demonstration of wealth and commercial power. This piece of theatre was captured most famously by Canaletto, whose paintings of the occasion show that it was both a solemn affair and a popular celebration. And it is Canaletto s extraordinary depictions that have inspired this year s royal river pageant. This summer, the Thames will return triumphantly to the centre of national life as the stage for the climax of the diamond jubilee, regaining once more its rightful and historic place as London s grandest street.

        "target_summary": "As Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee approached in June 2012, celebrations were set to culminate in a truly spectacular pageant on the Thames. Hundreds of diverse vessels, from a new royal barge to the historic Dunkirk \"little ships,\" would embark on a grand procession from Hammersmith to Greenwich, symbolically embodying the nation and Commonwealth. This marked only the second time in British history a monarch had achieved such an anniversary, the first being Queen Victoria 115 years prior. The choice of a river flotilla, rather than traditional land parades, stemmed from the monarchy's deep and storied association with the Thames, historically revered as London's \"grandest street\" and a vital artery connecting royal residences.\n\nBy the Tudor period, the majestic Thames served as an unparalleled processional route, far superior to the capital's narrow, crowded streets. Its broad expanse frequently became a stage for significant royal events, often crafted to lend legitimacy to controversial unions. A vivid example is Anne Boleyn's coronation in 1533. Three days before her crowning, a heavily pregnant Anne, clad in virginal white, embarked from Greenwich Palace in a fantastical river procession. Accompanied by theatrical pageantry, including a mechanical dragon that \"pranced about furiously, twisting its tail and belching out wildfire,\" and lavishly decorated barges from the City of London's livery companies, she was conveyed to the Tower. This highly stage-managed spectacle aimed to garner public loyalty and acceptance for Henry VIII's new, unpopular queen.\n\nSimilarly, in 1662, Catherine of Braganza, Charles II's foreign and Catholic queen, made her grand state entry into London via a monumental \"Aqua Triumphalis\" on the Thames. Eyewitnesses like John Evelyn described it as \"the most magnificent triumph that ever floated,\" adorned with innumerable vessels and ornate pageants. Samuel Pepys, observing from Whitehall, famously noted \"10,000 barges and boats I think, for we could see no water for them,\" highlighting the sheer scale of this display designed to underscore the monarchy's power and legitimize Catherine's position.\n\nEven in the Victorian era, as the Thames transformed into an urban, industrial, and polluted waterway, it retained a peculiar royal connection. In 1865, the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, journeyed downriver to open the Crossness sewage pumping station, a testament to London's evolving relationship with its river. Although its ceremonial use waned significantly due to these profound changes, the Thames remained central to the annual Lord Mayor's Day procession from 1453 until 1856. This vibrant autumn spectacle saw the newly elected mayor travel in a gilded barge, accompanied by livery companies, to Westminster – a boisterous and symbolic demonstration of the city's wealth, commercial power, and allegiance, famously captured by Canaletto's extraordinary paintings.\n\nIt is these evocative depictions by Canaletto that directly inspired the 2012 royal river pageant. This modern event triumphantly returned the Thames to the heart of national life, reinstating its historic role as London's grandest and most celebrated processional stage for a momentous royal anniversary.",

        "title": "Philip of Spain, King of England: The Forgotten Sovereign",
        "content": "Reviewed by: John Edwards Author: Harry Kelsey Publisher: IB Tauris Price (RRP):  18.99 Ad In recent years, some historians have begun to look again at the character and reign of Henry VIII s eldest daughter, Mary. As a result she is beginning at last to be given her proper title, Mary I not  Mary Tudor . And the religious persecution that led to her label  Bloody    which she did not in fact acquire until the 18th century   is being explained properly, though not excused. Yet, while she has always received detailed biographical treatment, her husband, Philip of Spain, has rarely been included in the picture. Just as Mary is not normally acknowledged as queen of Spain, which she was from 1556 to 1558, so even Spanish biographers of Philip tend to gloss over his time as king of England. Glyn Redworth and Henry Kamen are exceptions to this rule, and now Harry Kelsey, a biographer of Elizabethan sea-dogs Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins, has devoted a book to their Spanish adversary. Kelsey writes elegantly and in a lively way, and his account of Philip s connection with England is based on a wide range of manuscripts and printed sources, from England, Spain and elsewhere. Until he arrives at the couple s marriage, in Winchester Cathedral on 25 July 1554, he uses alternating chapters to outline the biographies, and particularly the academic and political education, of Mary and Philip respectively. While there are voluminous sources for Mary s life and reign, as is the case with all English sovereigns, it has traditionally been noted that much of the documentation of Philip s activities, from 1554, were lost at sea when the king was returning from the Netherlands to Spain in 1559. This has been the customary excuse for not giving proper attention to Philip I of England, even though a significant amount of useful material still survives in European archives. Yet there is in this book a curious lack of connection between the voluminous sources on which the book is based and the story that the reader is actually told. Kelsey seems most interested in personalities, including a particular stress on physical appearance. This is fine in itself, as 16th-century monarchs were just as interested as modern political leaders in the dark arts of spin, but it should have been balanced by a greater concentration on the European political context of Mary and Philip s day. Certain activities at court in Whitehall, particularly the Spanish war exercise known as the  cane-game  (juego de ca as) are given detailed treatment, while major issues confronting England and continental Europe are often mentioned only briefly. In particular, the role of religion, which was perhaps the most important thing to both king and queen as they struggled to defend Roman Catholicism against the Reformation, is referred to but never properly explained. Spanish sources do, however, exist, though not used here, to reveal a deep involvement of Philip and his Spanish ecclesiastical advisers in the notorious burning in Mary s reign of nearly 300 people, because of their Protestant belief. This is an enjoyable read, then, but a strangely unsatisfying one, and a fuller account of Philip s brief English reign is still needed. Ad John Edwards is senior research fellow in Spanish at the University of Oxford and the author of Mary I, England s Catholic Queen (Yale University Press, 2011)",
        "target_summary": "Recent historical inquiry has begun to rightfully re-evaluate the reign of Mary I, restoring her proper title and contextualizing the religious persecutions that later earned her the \"Bloody\" moniker. Yet, despite this renewed focus on Mary, her husband, Philip of Spain, often remains a shadowy figure, rarely integrated into English narratives of their joint rule. Harry Kelsey's new book endeavors to illuminate this overlooked period, presenting Philip's connection to England through elegant prose and extensive archival research spanning multiple countries.\n\nKelsey skillfully outlines the early lives and political education of both Mary and Philip through alternating chapters, culminating in their 1554 marriage. He notably challenges the traditional excuse that vital documentation for Philip's English activities was lost at sea, asserting the existence of significant surviving material. However, despite this rigorous source base, the reviewer observes a peculiar disconnect in the narrative. Kelsey, while engaging, prioritizes personal anecdotes and physical descriptions, often at the expense of the broader European political tapestry and the profound religious conflicts of the era. Minor court spectacles, such as the \"cane-game,\" receive detailed attention, while pivotal issues like the defence of Roman Catholicism and, crucially, Philip's significant role in the notorious Protestant burnings, are merely touched upon rather than thoroughly explored. Consequently, this otherwise enjoyable read ultimately proves an unsatisfying one, leaving the critical demand for a truly comprehensive account of Philip's brief but impactful English reign still unmet.",

        "title": "The 8 most famous royal weddings in British history",
        "content": "Ad 18 January 1486: Henry VII and Elizabeth of York The Wars of the Roses ended and the Tudor dynasty began with one of the most popular royal weddings in history. After Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, defeated King Richard III at the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, he claimed the English throne. As Henry VII consolidated his power, he received frequent reminders of his 1483 public oath to marry Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV and niece of Richard III. On 10 December 1485, Speaker of the House Sir Thomas Lovell praised Henry s plans to marry Elizabeth  as consolation to the entire kingdom . The members of parliament agreed and  thereupon, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in that same parliament, rising from their seats, and standing before the King seated on his royal throne, bowed their heads, made the same request with lowered voice: to whom the King indeed responded with his own voice,  According to their desires and requests, he himself was equally pleased to proceed . The wedding ceremony took place at Westminster Abbey, followed by a banquet at Westminster Hall. Elizabeth of York acquired sumptuous gowns in blue, purple and tawny colours around the time of her wedding and one of these may have been her wedding dress. Henry and Elizabeth s eldest son, Prince Arthur, was born eight months later, on 19 September 1486. Francis Bacon described Arthur as \"born in the eighth month, as the physicians do prejudge , yet \"strong and able\". It is possible that the infant was conceived before the wedding, as a formal betrothal was considered almost as binding as a marriage at that time. The final scene of Shakespeare s Richard III immortalised Tudor hopes for the marriage to result in lasting peace and prosperity for England:  O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,/The true succeeders of each royal house,/By God s fair ordinance conjoin together,/And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so./Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace.

English Protestants feared that Philip would bring the Spanish inquisition with him and involve England in Spain s continental wars. As a Roman Catholic and a daughter of King Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, Mary was favourably disposed toward Spain and regarded her cousin Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain, as a father figure. So when Charles proposed that Mary marry his son and heir, the future Philip II, Mary was delighted to accept, especially after she saw a handsome portrait of her future husband. Parliament attempted to persuade Mary to marry an Englishman and when that failed, passed the Queen Mary s Marriage Act to limit Philip s powers in England. Despite the opposition to the marriage, Mary and Philip had a lavish royal wedding that reflected their status as reigning monarchs (Charles V had declared his son Philip king of Naples and Sicily in time for the ceremony so that he would not be outranked by his bride). The wedding took place at Winchester Cathedral. Contemporary accounts record that the cathedral was  richly hanged with arras and cloth of gold . Mary wore a purple satin wedding dress embroidered with pearls, while Philip was  richly apparelled in cloth of gold . The ceremony was followed by a banquet at the Bishop of Winchester s palace and also dancing. Philip and his Spanish courtiers were reportedly  out of countenance  because the English courtiers were better dancers. The lavish wedding was followed by the longest royal baby watch in English history. Mary displayed signs of what appeared to be pregnancy in July 1554. She went into seclusion expecting an imminent birth in April 1555 and there were repeated false rumours and premature celebrations that she had given birth to a son. In July 1555, Mary emerged from seclusion without having given birth. The marriage remained childless. Instead of a pregnancy, Mary had likely experienced symptoms of ovarian cancer. She died on 17 November 1558, possibly from cancer. A portrait of Philip II, king of Spain from 1556, and Queen Mary I of England.

Charles s father, James VI and I, who died in 1625, had hoped that a Roman Catholic princess from a major European power such as France or Spain would bring a large dowry to her marriage with his son. James s wish came to pass: the wedding ceremony of Charles and Henrietta Maria took place in Paris in front of Notre Dame cathedral, according to the French protocol established for the wedding of the Protestant future king Henry IV of France and Roman Catholic Marguerite de Valois in 1572. This precedent was an unhappy one, because the St Bartholomew s Day massacre of Protestants by Catholics followed the wedding of Henry and Marguerite. The marriage was eventually annulled, as the couple were childless and Henry was determined to remarry and father heirs. There were few English guests at the wedding of Charles and Henrietta Maria. In fact, even the groom himself stayed away: Charles was represented by a proxy, the Protestant Duke of Chevreuse. Charles had visited Paris and glimpsed Henrietta Maria on a previous occasion, en route to Spain, but would have been reluctant to participate in a French royal wedding that included Roman Catholic rites. The wedding breakfast took place at the Archbishop of Paris s residence followed by further festivities at the Louvre. Charles and Henrietta Maria met six weeks after their wedding, when the bride, escorted by the Duke of Buckingham, arrived in England with her household. The marriage was consummated in Canterbury, the first major stop on the bridal party s journey from Dover to London. One of Charles s grooms of the bedchamber wrote to his wife on 14 June:  This last night the king and queene did lie together here att Conterburie, Long maye they do soe, and haue as manie children as wee are like to haue.  Charles and Henrietta Maria would have nine children, but only two sons   the future kings Charles II and James VII and II   would outlive Henrietta Maria. The intense public interest in Charles and Henrietta Maria s contentious royal wedding resulted in the publication of printed pamphlets discussing the event from a variety of perspectives. The clauses of the marriage contract were available for readers interested in the political and religious implications of the match, which included freedom of worship for the bride and control over the upbringing of her children until the age of 13. There were also detailed accounts of the ceremony, the order of precedence and what everyone wore. One pamphlet, titled The Solemnization of the Marriage of the King of Great Britaine, stated:  Then came the King of France, in a garment all embroidered with Gold and Silver, with the Lady his Sister in his right hand, who had a crown upon her head, and her Gown powdered all over with [fleurs-de-lys] of Gold.  Henrietta Maria chose a deep blue wedding dress that set off the fleurs-de-lys, the emblem of the French royal house. Charles and Henrietta Maria developed a strong personal bond but the marriage remained unpopular. Henrietta Maria was eventually impeached as queen by the House of Commons in 1643 during the Civil War, on eight charges including inciting the Irish to revolt and pawning crown jewels to pay royalist mercenaries. Charles was beheaded in 1649. Henrietta Maria died in 1669. 10 February 1840: Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha As a reigning queen, Queen Victoria was obliged to propose to Prince Albert in reverse of the usual custom of the time, but she was determined to ensure that her wedding ceremony would mirror the experiences of other British women. When asked if she wanted the word  obey  included in the vows, Victoria stated that  it was her wish to be married in all respects like any other woman, according to the revered usages of the Church of England, and that, though not as a queen, as a woman she was ready to promise all things contained in that portion of Liturgy . A royal bride would not omit the word  obey  from the vows until the wedding of one of Victoria s great-granddaughters, Lady May Cambridge, in 1931. The wedding of Victoria and Albert took place in the Chapel Royal at St James s Palace. In contrast to previous royal brides, who had usually worn sumptuous coloured materials embroidered with gold or silver for their wedding dresses, Victoria chose a comparatively simple white silk dress adorned with Honiton lace and orange blossoms. The style was imitated by other brides, beginning a fashion for white wedding dresses that continues to the present day. As a young princess, Victoria had toured Britain, including industrial towns, with her mother, and the plans for her wedding dress were intended to benefit British manufacturing. The silk was woven in Spitalfields, whose silk industry was experiencing a decline, while the lace came from the villages of Honiton and Beer in Devon. Victoria wore her wedding lace on special occasions for the rest of her life and was buried in her veil in 1901. Victoria s journal demonstrated a keen awareness of the public interest in her wedding. She wrote:  I never saw such crowds as there were in the Park, & they cheered most enthusiastically.  Newspapers covered all aspects of the ceremony and festivities. The wedding breakfast took place at Buckingham Palace and included a plum cake that weighed 300 pounds (a slice of the cake was sold at auction in 2016 for  1,500). But Victoria s taste in cakes changed a few years into her marriage. The invention of baking powder in 1843 allowed cakes to rise higher than previously possible, and Victoria enjoyed this new sponge cake with her afternoon tea. Her new favourite dessert became known as Victoria sponge cake. Victoria was delighted with Albert but she was determined to place her duties as queen above all personal considerations. She insisted on just a three-day honeymoon at Windsor Castle, so that she would not fall behind on state business.

After generations of German princes and princesses marrying into the royal family, the arrival of a Danish princess captured the popular imagination and Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote a poem welcoming  the Sea King s Daughter  as a  joy to the people and joy to the throne . Alexandra wore white silk trimmed with Honiton lace and embroidered with roses, thistles and shamrocks to symbolise England, Scotland and Ireland. While the bride was admired for her beauty, fashion sense and unpretentious manner, Queen Victoria s choice of St George s Chapel as the setting for her heir s wedding attracted widespread criticism because of its comparatively small size and its location outside London. Victoria was in mourning for Prince Albert, who had died of typhoid fever in 1861, and wished to avoid appearing in public in the capital. At St George s Chapel she could watch the ceremony from the seclusion of Catherine of Aragon s closet   a private recessed balcony above the altar that had allowed Catherine to watch Order of the Garter ceremonies without being observed. Victoria also wrote the guest list, which consisted of the royal household, royal relatives and political figures, all required to wear half mourning colours of grey, lilac and white. The groom was permitted to invite four friends while the bride s side was restricted to her immediate family. Only 38 people were invited to attend the luncheon that followed the ceremony, which Queen Victoria herself did not attend (she instead dined privately with her youngest daughter, Beatrice). Victoria considered a large wedding reception to be inappropriate during her mourning for Albert. The other 500 wedding guests returned to London after the ceremony aboard an overcrowded train from Windsor station. 20 November 1947: The future Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh The wedding of Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, RN (born Prince Philip of Greece) balanced royal ceremonial with postwar austerity. The ceremony took place at Westminster Abbey, which had been revived as a popular setting for royal weddings after the First World War. The couple posed for official engagement photos that displayed Elizabeth s engagement ring, which was designed by Philip with jewels that had belonged to his mother, Alice of Battenberg. With this engagement ring, Philip set a precedent that would be followed by his grandson, Prince Harry, who would design a ring for his fianc  Meghan Markle including diamonds that belonged to his late mother, Princess Diana. At the time of Elizabeth and Philip s wedding, food and clothing rationing was still in effect. The British government provided Elizabeth with the 300 clothing coupons necessary for her ivory silk wedding dress, adorned with 10,000 pearls embroidered into white rose of York designs and crystals arranged as ears of corn. One of the bridesmaids, Elizabeth s cousin Margaret Rhodes, recalled:  There was rationing of course, and we used up all our clothes coupons.  The wedding breakfast featured partridges, which were not subject to rationing. The widespread perception that food was scarce in Britain, however, resulted in members of the public in the Commonwealth and the United States sending tinned food to Buckingham Palace. The government of the Australian state of Queensland sent the royal couple 500 crates of tinned pineapple as a wedding gift. Both the bride and groom had relatives who were left off the guest list because of personal and political considerations. Elizabeth s uncle, the former King Edward VIII, whose abdication to marry Wallis Simpson had led to the unexpected accession of Elizabeth s father as King George VI, was not invited. Philip had three surviving sisters in 1947 who had married German princes, some of whom had been involved with the Nazi party. These sisters and their husbands were also not extended invitations to the wedding, and Philip s family was represented by his Mountbatten relatives on his mother s side. Philip s cousin David Mountbatten was his supporter, and another cousin, Pamela Mountbatten, was a bridesmaid. Pamela recalled that when the wedding party appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace:  We were met by an incredible sight: the police had been holding everyone back around the Victoria Memorial but when we came out, they let them go and we could see   and hear   a sea of people surging forward. Every time the newlyweds waved, the volume of cheering increased. We were later told that while they were waiting the crowd had been singing  All the Nice Girls Love a Sailor .

The young Lady Diana Spencer captured the popular imagination as  Shy Di  , posing for photographs with Charles but evading questions about her relationship with him. The wedding was a global television sensation, with more than 750 million viewers around the world watching the ceremony. Some 600,000 people lined the procession route to catch a glimpse of the royal couple on their wedding day. The wedding took place at St Paul s Cathedral in London and was attended by 2,700 guests. Political considerations affected the guest list because Charles s status as heir to the throne made his wedding a state occasion. In addition to Commonwealth governors-general and heads of government, European royals and political leaders were also invited to the wedding. A few invitations were declined for political reasons: King Juan Carlos of Spain made headlines around the world when he stated that he and his wife, Queen Sofia, would not attend the wedding because Charles and Diana would be boarding the Royal Yacht Britannia in Gibraltar for their honeymoon. Spain had ceded Gibraltar to Britain according to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, but 20th-century Spanish leaders disputed Britain s claim to this overseas territory. The Spanish royal family were not the only absent invitees. The president of Greece, Konstantinos Karamanlis, also declined his invitation because Charles s second cousin, former King Constantine II of Greece, had been invited as  King of the Hellenes . In 1974, Karamanlis s government had held a referendum that confirmed the abolition of the Greek monarchy and the establishment of a republic. The president of Ireland also declined to attend the wedding. Diana wore a silk taffeta and antique lace wedding dress   designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel  with puffed sleeves and a full skirt. The glass coach that transported Diana and her father to St Paul s Cathedral was not large enough to accommodate the 25-foot train   bridesmaid India Hicks (the daughter of Pamela Mountbatten) recalled  trying as best as I could to de-wrinkle the situation  as Diana stepped out of the carriage to enter the cathedral. The dress set a trend for elaborate wedding dresses that continued throughout the 1980s. Charles and Diana separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996. Diana died in a car accident in Paris in 1997.

William was the first direct heir to the throne to marry a bride from a middle-class background since the future King James VII and II married Anne Hyde in 1660. In contrast to previous royal couples, who had experienced comparatively brief courtships and engagements, William and Catherine had met in university and been in a relationship for years before announcing their engagement. Catherine had gradually become familiar to the public as William s girlfriend   though William never made a public statement to that effect, in the same manner as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The wedding took place at Westminster Abbey, which the couple customised with English maple trees along the aisle that were replanted at Prince Charles s Highgrove Estate after the ceremony. Catherine wore an ivory satin dress with lace appliqu  designed by Sarah Burton, the creative director at the Alexander McQueen fashion house. The style was compared to past wedding gowns including those of Queen Victoria, Queen Elizabeth II and Grace Kelly, who married Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956. William and Catherine had a maid of honour, the bride s sister Pippa Middleton, and a best man, Prince Harry, in addition to young bridesmaids and page boys. While previous royal couples expected (and sometimes displayed) a wide variety of gifts, William and Catherine encouraged well-wishers to donate to one of a recommended list of charities. This raised the profile of charity gift registries as an option for other couples and set a trend for subsequent royal couples, including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The wedding of William and Catherine was credited with increasing interest in the monarchy among younger people   a trend that continues with the wedding of Harry and Meghan.

        "target_summary": "Royal weddings throughout history have often transcended mere celebrations, serving as pivotal moments that shaped dynasties, reflected societal values, and occasionally ignited profound controversy. Each event, from medieval unions sealing peace to modern spectacles broadcast globally, offers a vivid glimpse into the intricate intersection of personal unions and national destinies.\n\nThe union of **Henry VII and Elizabeth of York** in 1486 wasn't just a wedding; it was the symbolic end of the Wars of the Roses and the dawn of the mighty Tudor dynasty. After Henry's victory at Bosworth Field, his public pledge to marry Elizabeth, daughter of the previous monarch, was met with enthusiastic parliamentary support, hailed as \"consolation to the entire kingdom.\" Their Westminster Abbey ceremony, though less visually documented than later events, united rival houses, with Elizabeth donning sumptuous gowns in blue, purple, and tawny hues. Eight months later, the birth of Prince Arthur cemented hopes for lasting peace, a sentiment beautifully immortalized by Shakespeare.\n\nIn stark contrast, **Mary I's marriage to Philip II of Spain** in 1554 was fraught with tension and public discontent. As England's first reigning queen and a staunch Roman Catholic, Mary's decision to wed a foreign, Catholic monarch sparked Wyatt's rebellion and widespread fears of Spanish influence. Despite parliamentary opposition and attempts to limit Philip's power, the lavish ceremony at Winchester Cathedral unfolded, adorned with rich cloths of gold and featuring Mary in a pearl-embroidered purple satin gown. Philip, strategically declared King of Naples and Sicily to match her regal splendor, was equally richly apparelled. Yet, this grand affair was tragically followed by a \"royal baby watch\" that revealed a phantom pregnancy, likely due to ovarian cancer, leaving the couple childless and foreshadowing Mary's early demise.\n\nA contentious blend of religion and politics defined the 1625 marriage of **Charles I and Henrietta Maria of France**. Charles, supreme governor of the Anglican Church, wed a Roman Catholic princess, a match controversial enough that the groom himself was absent, represented by a Protestant proxy at the Paris ceremony. Henrietta Maria, resplendent in a deep blue gown adorned with the French fleur-de-lys, only met her husband six weeks later when she arrived in England. Despite intense public interest and printed pamphlets dissecting the match's implications – including the bride's freedom of worship – their strong personal bond couldn't overcome the marriage's unpopularity, ultimately culminating in Henrietta's impeachment and Charles's execution during the Civil War.\n\nShifting to a more personal yet equally influential realm, **Queen Victoria's 1840 marriage to Prince Albert** redefined royal weddings. As a reigning monarch, Victoria defied custom by proposing to Albert, but then insisted on a ceremony \"like any other woman,\" including the traditional \"obey\" vow. Breaking from previous royal brides' opulent, colored gowns, Victoria pioneered the enduring trend of the white wedding dress, choosing a comparatively simple white silk adorned with Honiton lace and orange blossoms. This choice was not only stylish but also a conscious effort to boost British manufacturing. Her brief three-day honeymoon underscored her unwavering commitment to duty, while her love for a new baked treat inadvertently birthed the iconic Victoria sponge.\n\nDecades later, **Queen Victoria's son, Edward VII, wed Alexandra of Denmark** in 1863, marking the first royal wedding at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. Alexandra, a Danish princess, captivated the public, celebrated by Tennyson as \"the Sea King's Daughter.\" She too wore white silk with Honiton lace, embroidered with national symbols. However, the venue choice itself was controversial; Victoria, deep in mourning for Albert, preferred the chapel's seclusion and imposed a strict guest list requiring half-mourning attire, watching the ceremony from a private balcony rather than participating publicly. This somber approach, limiting guests and an official reception, reflected her personal grief.\n\nThe 1947 wedding of **Princess Elizabeth (future Queen Elizabeth II) and Prince Philip** was a remarkable blend of tradition and postwar austerity. Their Westminster Abbey ceremony saw Elizabeth in an ivory silk gown, adorned with 10,000 pearls and crystals, a marvel given the prevailing clothing rationing, for which she received 300 government coupons. Amidst national scarcity, food gifts, like 500 crates of tinned pineapple from Australia, poured in. The guest list also reflected political realities, with Elizabeth's uncle, Edward VIII, and Philip's German relatives notably absent. Yet, the jubilant balcony appearance, met by \"a sea of people surging forward,\" symbolized a nation looking towards a hopeful future.\n\nThe 1981 union of **Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer** was a global phenomenon, captivating over 750 million television viewers and drawing immense crowds to St Paul's Cathedral. Diana, the \"Shy Di,\" emerged from her carriage in an elaborate silk taffeta dress with a 25-foot train, so voluminous it barely fit. Despite the fairy-tale imagery, political undercurrents affected the guest list, with Spain, Greece, and Ireland declining invitations due to diplomatic disputes over Gibraltar and monarchical recognition. The \"wedding of the century\" set trends for elaborate bridal fashion but, sadly, preceded a difficult separation and divorce.\n\nMore recently, the 2011 wedding of **Prince William and Catherine Middleton** successfully blended age-old royal custom with contemporary sensibilities. Their long university courtship marked a departure from historical norms, and Catherine, from a middle-class background, became the first such bride for a direct heir in centuries. Westminster Abbey was transformed with English maple trees, and Catherine’s ivory satin gown, designed by Sarah Burton, drew comparisons to royal predecessors. This modern royal couple encouraged charitable donations instead of gifts, a trend that resonated widely and, alongside their accessible charm, significantly boosted youth interest in the monarchy, signaling a fresh chapter for the institution.",

But how much do you know about the six key women in Henry VIII s life? Here s our comprehensive guide to each of his spouses   from Catherine of Aragon through to Katherine Parr  Ad Who were the six wives of Henry VIII   in order? Henry VIII is England s most married monarch. He had six wives in total between 1509 and 1547. These were, in order: According to historian Alison Weir, all six of Henry VIII s weddings were  private affairs . Henry VIII surrounded by his six wives. Clockwise from top: Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon, Katherine Parr and Jane Seymour. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Why did Henry VIII have six wives? Answered by historian Lauren Mackay One could be forgiven for assuming Henry had notoriously bad luck when it came to marriage, but in truth it was his desire for a male son and heir to the Tudor dynasty that was the driving force behind most of his marital decisions. This, coupled with Henry s infatuation with Anne Boleyn, was behind his desire to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and marry her. Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour and Catherine Howard. (Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Henry would divorce two wives, and behead two   Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard   for adultery and treason. He no doubt would have remained married to his third wife, Jane Seymour, who gave him his son and heir, but she died in childbirth. In the end, only two wives   Anne of Cleves, who he divorced years prior, and his final wife, Katherine Parr   would outlive him. Lauren Mackay is the author of Inside the Tudor Court: Henry VIII and his Six Wives through the Life and Writings of the Spanish Ambassador, Eustace Chapuys (Amberley Publishing) Did you know  You can remember the order of the six wives by rhyming their names:  Kate and Anne and Jane, and Anne and Kate (again, again) Your guide to Henry VIII's six wives Charlotte Hodgman, editor of BBC History Revealed magazine, explores the six women who married Henry VIII... Catherine of Aragon (1485 1536) Born in Alcal  de Henares, Princess Catherine was betrothed to England s Prince Arthur at the age of three. A devout Catholic, she was married to Henry for nearly 24 years and never acknowledged the annulment of their union Catherine of Aragon, first wife of King Henry VIII. (Photo by Imagno/Getty Images) The question of Henry s marriage became of paramount importance to England in 1502, following the death of his elder brother, Arthur. As the new heir to the throne, it was up to Henry to continue the fledgling Tudor dynasty. He didn t need to look far for a possible bride: Catherine of Aragon was the youngest daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. Engaged as a child to Prince Arthur as part of Henry VII s plans for an alliance between Spain and England, 15-year-old Catherine arrived in England in 1501 and was married on 14 November that year. Half of her promised dowry of 200,000 crowns was paid shortly after. It was the perfect royal match but, just six months later, Arthur was dead. To avoid handing back Catherine s dowry, and to maintain the Spanish alliance, a new betrothal was made between the widow and Prince Henry, five years her junior. In Tudor eyes, Catherine s marriage to Arthur had made her Henry s sister. So papal dispensation was sought, and granted, to permit the union   but only after Catherine had sworn that her short marriage had not been consummated. Five years of wrangling over her dowry ensued, but Catherine s patience was rewarded when, in 1509, she married the new king, 18-year-old Henry. The union seems to have been, initially, one of mutual love as well as dynastic advancement. Henry had known Catherine for nearly a decade on their marriage, and she is described as being every inch the beautiful queen. For the first 10 to 15 years, the marriage appears to have been a happy one For the first 10 to 15 years, the marriage appears to have been a happy one. Henry himself wrote that the love he bore his wife was such that  if he were still free, he would choose her in preference to all others . The pair shared a passion for learning, religion and court entertainment, and Catherine proved herself a competent regent while Henry campaigned in France between 1512 14. But by 1518, relations had soured. Catherine, now 33, had at least six pregnancies in nine years, but only two children had survived. One longed-for boy, Prince Henry, was born in 1511 and a huge tournament was held in his honour, the third most expensive event of Henry s reign. Young Prince Hal was the toast of the kingdom but, just 52 days after his birth, Henry s much-loved heir died. The prince s death devastated the couple but hope was restored with the birth of Princess Mary in 1516. Her birth proved Catherine could bear a living child, but could she provide a son? Henry, it seemed, had his doubts. By 1525, with his wife no longer able to bear children and with only one legitimate child   a daughter at that   Henry began to question his marriage. Had Catherine and Arthur s union been consummated; was God punishing him for marrying his brother s widow? Your ultimate guide to the Tudors What is the rhyme about Henry VIII s six wives? Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived The ditty refers to the fate of each wife: Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII divorced after the king broke from Rome to marry his second wife; Anne Boleyn died by execution after she was accused of having sexual relations with five men, including her brother, outside of her marriage; Jane Seymour died during childbirth; Catherine Howard was beheaded; and Katherine Parr outlived Henry VIII and consequently  survived  their relationship. 8 places associated with Henry VIII s wives that you can visit The famous rhyme has been memorised by generations of school children learning about Henry VIII. Although only six words long, it is not entirely accurate   Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves did not technically divorce Henry VIII; instead their marriages were annulled. Another version of the poem is:  King Henry VIII, to six wives he was wedded. One died, one survived, two divorced, two beheaded . Anne Boleyn (c1501 1536) The daughter of a courtier and diplomat, Anne s relationship with Henry brought about the English Reformation. She was the first English queen to be publicly executed Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII and mother of future queen, Elizabeth I. (Photo by Time Life Pictures/Mansell/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images) Henry had another reason for wishing to end his marriage to Catherine of Aragon: he had fallen in love. The object of his affections was the quick-witted Anne Boleyn, who had returned to England in 1522, after nearly seven years living at the French court. By Tudor tastes, which held fair women in high esteem, the brunette, dark-eyed Anne was no belle, but her charm, style and sophistication set her apart from the other ladies at court and ultimately captured Henry s heart. Anne had been at court for four years before there was any hint of romance between the pair, but by 1526 Cupid s arrow had struck and Henry had begun courting Anne in earnest. In his early relationship with Anne, Henry revealed a genuinely romantic side   one that few would equate with the cantankerous, suspicious and cruel tyrant of his later years. The 17 surviving love letters from Henry to Anne are the stuff of true Tudor romance. In them, it s clear to see that Henry s desire for Anne is growing, as is his frustration at her constant refusal to become his mistress, and his desperation for the dissolution of his marriage. At some point in 1532, Anne submitted to the king s advances and, by December that year, she was pregnant. Henry was beside himself with joy. Achieving his annulment from Catherine   who clung grimly and steadfastly to her marriage and crown   now consumed his thoughts. Watch: Tracy Borman on what Elizabeth I thought of her mother   in less than 60 seconds It was imperative the new baby be born legitimate so, on 25 January 1533, Henry married Anne Boleyn in secret. With the Pope still refusing to end the marriage, the monumental decision was taken to reject papal authority altogether. On 23 May, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer confirmed the annulment and Anne was crowned on 1 June in a magnificent coronation. Her seven-year wait for crown, and king, was over. Having overturned the religious and political life of England to marry Anne and conceive an heir, Henry was convinced his unborn child would be a son. The birth of Elizabeth, on 7 September 1533, therefore, was a bitter blow and must have caused considerable anxiety to Anne, who had seen her predecessor cast aside for the same. Sunshine and storms The fiery nature of Henry and Anne s relationship is well-documented but they are also described as being  merry  together. Theirs, as one historian puts it, was  a tumultuous relationship of sunshine and storms . Anne suffered at least two miscarriages during the marriage, the second of which, in January 1536, was a boy. But, despite Anne s failure to produce an heir, it is widely believed that Henry remained committed to his wife. Court gossip and intrigue, however, was to change his mind. Anne s downfall seems to have been result of malicious gossip and plots to end her influence over the King. Rumours of her infidelity emerged after a lady-in-waiting was heard to describe her own loose living as being  little in comparison with that of the Queen . Henry, who prized chastity in his wives above all else, ordered his chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, to investigate, telling him  if it turns out that your report, which I do not wish to believe, is untrue, you will receive pain of death in place of [the accused].  Little wonder, then, that by May 1536, Cromwell had unearthed  evidence  of adultery, incest and conspiring the king s death. Anne s beheading, at the hands of a French executioner, was to be a turning point in Henry s life and reign. Henry s break with Rome: king v pope Henry s break with Rome heralded the creation of a new Church, and the king s own excommunication  England s split from papal power was triggered by Henry s desire to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, a union for which he felt God was punishing him with a lack of male heir. The king s desire to marry Anne Boleyn only increased his determination: it became known as  The King s Great Matter . In 1527, Pope Clement VII was approached for an annulment on scriptural grounds but, to Henry s anger and frustration, it was refused. A legal approach seemed the only solution and it fell to Wolsey s successor, Thomas Cromwell, to use the powers of Parliament to decide the matter in the King s favour. A series of acts were passed, cutting back papal power and influence in England. In 1533, Thomas Cranmer was appointed to the post of Archbishop of Canterbury and, on 23 May that year   hastened by the news that Anne was pregnant   he pronounced Henry and Catherine s marriage to be against the law of God. Five days later, Cranmer validated Anne and Henry s marriage, which had taken place some months earlier. The pope was infuriated by the news, and excommunicated Henry. In England, Parliament was swiftly called, and the legislation to enact Henry s decision to break with the Church in Rome was passed. The Act of Supremacy, which followed in November 1534, recognised Henry as supreme head of the Church of England, and rejected all  foreign authority . This effectively brought an end to centuries of papal jurisdiction over religious life in England. The act also stated that Henry and his heirs would have  full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, reform, order, correct, restrain and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, o ences... whatsoever they be.  Cromwell now had the tools with which to reform the English Church. In January 1536, he embarked upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries, bringing their immense wealth and landholdings under crown control. Jane Seymour (c1508 1537) Lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon and then Anne Boleyn, Jane was the only one of Henry s wives to receive a queen s funeral, despite the fact she was never crowned Jane Seymour, third wife of Henry VIII. (Photo by Getty Images) As Anne met her grisly end, Henry, now 45 and without a male heir, had already found his third wife   Jane Seymour, Anne s lady-in-waiting. Demure, calm and gentle, 27-year-old Jane was Anne s opposite in both looks and temperament, and within 24 hours of Anne s death, Henry and Jane were betrothed. Jane s hold over Henry has been much discussed by historians. Although lacking Anne s education and sophistication, Jane is said to have possessed a quiet determination and was able to manage Henry and his everincreasing outbursts of temper. When Henry learned of her pregnancy in early 1537, he took great pains to ensure her every whim was catered for, even shipping quails eggs from France to satisfy her cravings. Nothing was denied the woman he described as his  one true wife  and his attentions were rewarded with the birth of Edward in October 1537. But 12 days later, Henry was mourning the death of his third wife, after postnatal complications. Anne of Cleves (1515 1557) Born in D sseldorf, Anne was culturally unsophisticated by Tudor standards. She was referred to as  The King s Beloved Sister  after the annulment of her marriage to Henry Anne of Cleves, fourth wife of Henry VIII. (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images); Paris, Mus e Du Louvre. (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images) Henry remained single for two years after Jane s death, but England had become vulnerable without the support of Rome. A political alliance was deemed necessary and the net was cast for a new wife. Henry s first glimpse of his future bride, Anne of Cleves, was a portrait by court painter Hans Holbein, in which she is depicted as a handsome, demure-looking woman. But, for Henry at least, the gap between portrait and reality was vast, and after meeting Anne he allegedly railed at his advisors:  I like her not! I like her not!  The meeting was a disaster. Henry, in chivalric tradition, chose to meet his bride-to-be in disguise. Anne s role was to see through this to recognise her King and true love Sadly no one explained this to Anne who, when Henry attempted to kiss her, is said to have recoiled at the over familiarity displayed by what she perceived to be a lowly servant. Henry, faced with the reality that he was no longer the golden Prince of his youth, was utterly humiliated. The marriage lasted just six months   Henry was allegedly unable to consummate the union and his eyes were already set on a new prize. Catherine Howard (c1524 1542) Cousin to Anne Boleyn, Catherine was raised in the household of her father s stepmother at Lambeth Palace. Her former indiscretions and an affair with a courtier cost her her life Catherine Howard, fifth wife of Henry VIII. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) Now nearly 50, Henry had fallen in love again, with another lady-in-waiting: 19-year-old Catherine Howard. To the ageing and ailing king, Catherine was everything a queen should be: obedient, fertile and chaste. Henry was entranced; Catherine made him feel young again, helping him forget the constant pain of his ulcerated legs.  The King is so amorous of her that he cannot treat her well enough, and caresses her more than he did the others , wrote the French ambassador of the love-struck king. How Catherine felt about being married to a man old enough to be her grandfather is unknown, but she is said to have accepted her lot with good grace, anxious to please her ambitious family. Catherine loved the luxury of court and her besotted husband showered her with expensive gifts. But, just 14 months into the marriage, a distraught Henry was presented with evidence of Catherine s infidelity: on 13 February 1542, his  rose without a thorn  was beheaded. Katherine Parr (1512 1548) Already twice-widowed, Katherine had begun a romance with Thomas Seymour, brother to the late queen, when she caught Henry s eye. She went on to marry Seymour four months after the king s death Katherine Parr, the last wife of Henry VIII. (Photo by Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images) Catherine s death saw Henry slump into a deep depression, and with no new wife waiting in the wings to distract him, his erratic temper made court a dangerous place to be. The lonely monarch needed a companion and, in 1543, as plague broke out in London, Henry married twice-widowed Katherine Parr at Hampton Court Palace. Aged 31, Katherine was slim and attractive   far from the matronly figure she is often portrayed as   with a deep love of learning and desire for religious reform. She quickly established herself as a major influence in Henry s life, developing relationships with the royal children and tending to the king. Her position seemed unshakeable, but in 1546, Katherine nearly became a third victim of the executioner s blade when her passion for the  new faith  (Protestantism) triggered accusations of heresy. Tipped off in advance, Katherine took to her bed claiming she was mortally ill; when Henry rushed to her side, she successfully defended herself and her actions. Katherine outlived Henry   as did Anne of Cleves   but she wasn t at the king s side when he died in 1547. When this larger-than-life ruler passed away, he was safe in the knowledge he had secured the continuation of the Tudor dynasty. But as Henry was buried beside his beloved Jane Seymour at Windsor Castle, no one could have known that it would be his daughters   Mary and Elizabeth   who would change the course of British history. Henry VIII's royal mistresses It wasn t only the lawfully wedded wives who shared the king's royal bed... Henry s favourite mistress was Elizabeth  Bessie  Blount, lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon. The affair began in c1514 and it is even claimed that Henry considered divorcing Catherine in order to marry her. Bessie gave birth to a son in 1519, a boy the king named Henry Fitzroy. Fitzroy was made Earl of Nottingham and Duke of Richmond and Somerset at the age of six, and Henry was even rumoured to be considering marrying Fitzroy to his legitimate daughter, Mary, as a way of legitimising the boy s claim to the throne. Whether Henry would have ever made Fitzroy his heir is unknown, for he died of tuberculosis in 1536, aged 17. Another of Henry s known mistresses was Mary Boleyn, sister to Anne. Mary, too, served at the French court, where she embarked on a string of a airs, including one with King Francis I himself. Mary s promiscuity earned her the nickname  The English Mare  and, later,  The Great Prostitute . Her five-year affair with Henry, which began in c1521, may have produced two children. There is even a claim that Henry had an affair with Anne and Mary s mother, Elizabeth, although when asked whether he had  meddled both with the mother and the sister , he is said to have muttered  never with the mother !  about Henry VIII's mistresses here Ad Charlotte Hodgman is editor of BBC History Revealed magazine.

        "target_summary": "The infamous rhyme, \"Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived,\" vividly encapsulates the turbulent marital saga of King Henry VIII, whose relentless pursuit of a male heir and personal desires profoundly reshaped England. From 1509 to 1547, Henry married six women, each union driven by a complex interplay of dynastic ambition, political alliances, and fleeting affections, with each wedding being a private affair.\n\nHis first queen, **Catherine of Aragon**, a devout Spanish princess, endured a nearly 24-year marriage, initially marked by mutual affection. However, her inability to produce a surviving male heir after multiple pregnancies, including the tragic death of an infant Prince Henry, fueled the King's anxieties about the Tudor dynasty. Convinced his marriage to his brother's widow was divinely cursed, Henry sought an annulment, defying the Pope and triggering the English Reformation, a monumental split from Rome that established Henry as the Supreme Head of the Church of England.\n\nBreaking from Rome, Henry secretly wed the captivating and quick-witted **Anne Boleyn**, whose sophisticated charm had utterly captivated him. Though she bore him the future Queen Elizabeth I, her failure to deliver a male heir and subsequent allegations of infidelity, incest, and treason—likely orchestrated by court rivals—led to her dramatic downfall and public execution in 1536, a turning point in English history.\n\nWithin days of Anne's death, Henry married **Jane Seymour**, a demure lady-in-waiting. Jane proved to be the longed-for queen, finally giving birth to Prince Edward, the male heir Henry so desperately desired. Tragically, she died just twelve days later from complications of childbirth, becoming the only wife Henry truly mourned and the recipient of a queen's funeral.\n\nSeeking a new political alliance after Jane's death, Henry next married **Anne of Cleves**, chosen from a flattering portrait by Hans Holbein. However, the King's personal encounter with Anne was disastrous; finding her far from the ideal he envisioned, he famously declared, \"I like her not!\" The marriage, reportedly unconsummated, was swiftly annulled, leaving Anne known as \"The King's Beloved Sister.\"\n\nThe aging and ailing Henry was briefly revitalized by his marriage to the vivacious, youthful **Catherine Howard**, a cousin of Anne Boleyn. Enamored, he showered her with affection and gifts, believing her to be his \"rose without a thorn.\" Yet, her past indiscretions and alleged infidelity during their marriage swiftly led to her beheading, making her the second queen to meet this grim fate.\n\nHis final wife, the intelligent and twice-widowed **Katherine Parr**, brought stability and companionship to the lonely monarch. A woman of deep learning and reforming zeal, Katherine skillfully navigated court politics, fostered relationships with the royal children, and even narrowly avoided charges of heresy herself due to her Protestant sympathies. Ultimately, Katherine Parr outlived the King, a testament to her resilience. Though his life was consumed by the quest for a male heir, Henry's legacy would surprisingly be most profoundly shaped by his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, who eventually ascended to the throne, changing the course of British history.",

        "title": "The discovery of Richard III's remains",
        "content": "How did you feel when you began to suspect that you had found the site where Richard was buried? Philippa Langley: The research, which was key, was looking really good. There was a lot of information to back us up, but the belief still wasn t there in terms of the academic community. It really was an uphill struggle, but I think we just had to say,  Let s just cut the tarmac and see.  Ad Michael Jones: Philippa and I first met in 2002, and I think it was in 2003 that we started having conversations about bringing the real Richard centre stage. When we finally found him, I remember a feeling of awe and excitement as the events unfolded. It was incredible. What did you think when you found that the skeleton was, in fact, curved? PL: That was a big moment for me, because I d spent so long researching Richard III. He was very physically able, so to be told   and it s such an inappropriate word, but we don t have another   that he was hunchbacked didn t fit with everything I knew about the man. But the specialists were telling me that he was, and when you looked into the grave you could see that he was hunched. The evidence was staring me right in the face. It absolutely threw me, though. I just felt that, if Richard was proved to be the hunchbacked king that Shakespeare had portrayed, it would set us back completely despite all the work that we had tried to do in looking at the real man. So many historians are tied to the Tudor propaganda, and I thought we d never get to the real man. MJ: I found it very moving. Richard s condition was used as a judgment by the Tudors and in Shakespeare. It was seen as a deformity, one that physically mirrored a deformity of the mind. I felt a profound sense of sympathy: I didn t see the deformed or evil individual, I saw a person under an oppressive weight, and this got me thinking about moments in his life and career. Philippa, do you find that your role in the Richard III Society makes it harder to persuade people that you re coming from a neutral viewpoint? PL: No, I don t think so. Would I say that I m neutral? I wouldn t say that I am, actually, because I do believe that Richard has been maligned, and I do believe that his reputation has been pretty much dragged through the mire for 500 years. But the Richard III Society has a mission statement that says that the traditional accounts of Richard are neither supported by the facts nor reasonably tenable, and I have to say that I concur with that mission statement 100 per cent. I would say that my position is that I need to have an open mind; as a screenwriter, I couldn t go into the research thinking that he was a saint, because I m looking for the human being. We re all complex, we re all conflicted. That s how we are, that s the human condition. So what I m looking for in Richard is what made his  human condition . What do you think is the truth behind the princes in the Tower story? MJ: I think it would be useful to say, first of all, where we agree! We both believe that Richard had a viable claim to the throne, despite it later being vigorously suppressed by the Tudors. We agree that Richard believed in this claim, and that quite a substantial number of other people did too. And that s important because it means that it was not necessary for him to kill the princes, the sons of Edward IV, to take the throne. So that is our common ground, and that puts us in a different camp from a lot of historians and a lot of people, but we feel that is good. What we disagree on is the fact that I feel that cruel necessity, and an attempt to rescue or remove the princes from the Tower early on in Richard s reign, may have forced the king s hand. In other words, the survival of Richard s dynasty was at stake. Philippa disagrees: she feels that he wouldn t have done that. Our belief is that a debate is very healthy, very honest, because we don t know what happened, and we believe that debating it will help push research onwards. That s what really needs to happen: we need to keep discussing this and hopefully more evidence may come to light one way or another. Where do you think that Richard s remains should be buried? PL: I think we re both of the opinion that we just have to let the due process of law take place. We definitely agree that Richard needs to be buried with decency, and dignity, and with honour, because in 1485 we now know that he wasn t given any of that. And I think that it s important that we make a powerful statement, and by reburying him in this way, we re saying that we recognise what went on in the past, but we re not repeating it. What surprised you most in the course of this whole project? PL: I think, for me, one of the things about the project that really hit home was some of the mythology that we ve been able to blow. For instance, we now know that his body wasn t thrown into the river Soar, and that he didn t have a withered arm. We know that his head didn t crack Bow Bridge when he was slung over a horse coming back into Leicester. We know that he didn t have kyphosis [a disability causing the head to be pushed on to the chest]. Those are just some of the myths that have been shattered already by this project, and I think that what I d like is that the project reveals this mythology, the stories that grew up around Richard, that subsequently became his history. MJ: There was something extraordinarily powerful in getting a sense of what his face might have been like   particularly with so much distortion around his story. For me, the book represents two journeys: the search for the remains, and the search for the real Richard. In a sense, the remains were buried and so was the real Richard, under a mound of Tudor propaganda. But there s another burial, which is of this endless debate over whether he was  bad  or  good . I believe that the book shows that he was a complicated, extraordinary, charismatic man, who could also be politically ruthless. Our hope is that instead of seeing him either as dark or white, people will get a view of a real man living in a very violent and turbulent period of history. Philippa Langley and Michael Jones are the authors of The King s Grave (John Murray).

        "target_summary": "The arduous journey to unearth the true story of Richard III, both literally and historically, commenced with a meticulous research effort that, despite its growing strength, faced a significant uphill battle for academic acceptance. Philippa Langley, a driving force behind the quest, vividly recalled the initial struggle to convince the academic community, while Michael Jones described the \"awe and excitement\" that permeated the unfolding events as they closed in on the king's long-lost burial site.\n\nA pivotal moment arrived with the discovery of the skeleton's curved spine. For Langley, this revelation was deeply unsettling, threatening to confirm the long-held, Shakespearean image of a \"hunchbacked king\" and potentially undermining years of work dedicated to rehabilitating Richard's reputation against pervasive Tudor propaganda. She feared it would entirely derail their efforts to reveal the genuine man. Jones, conversely, found the sight profoundly moving, interpreting the physical condition not as a mark of evil, as the Tudors had portrayed it, but as a source of deep sympathy for a person burdened by an \"oppressive weight\" of historical misrepresentation.\n\nLangley candidly admitted her non-neutral stance in her advocacy for Richard III, firmly believing his reputation had been \"dragged through the mire for 500 years.\" Yet, she underscored her commitment to an open-minded pursuit of historical truth, seeking the \"human being\" in all his complexity and contradictions, rather than a romanticized saint.\n\nThe contentious \"Princes in the Tower\" mystery formed a key point of discussion for the historians. Both agreed on Richard's legitimate claim to the throne, a claim so widely acknowledged that it rendered the murder of his nephews unnecessary for his accession. This shared conviction distinctly positioned them from many traditional historians. However, their perspectives diverged on the specifics: Jones entertained the possibility that \"cruel necessity\"—the imperative to secure his dynasty—might have forced Richard's hand regarding the princes' fate early in his reign, a notion Langley strongly disagreed with. They championed this divergence as a healthy and honest debate, crucial for stimulating further research.\n\nOn the matter of reburial, both historians concurred that Richard's remains deserved a ceremony imbued with decency, dignity, and honour—a stark contrast to the ignominious treatment he received in 1485. This reburial, they felt, would serve as a powerful statement, acknowledging past injustices without perpetuating them.\n\nOne of the most surprising outcomes of the project for Langley was the systematic dismantling of centuries-old myths. The project definitively debunked fabricated tales such as his body being thrown into the River Soar, his having a withered arm, or his head cracking Bow Bridge. For Jones, the profound impact lay in glimpsing Richard's true face, free from the distortions of propaganda. He viewed the project as a dual quest: the physical search for remains and the intellectual pursuit of the real Richard, both buried beneath a mound of Tudor invention and endless debate. Their ultimate hope is to transcend the simplistic \"good\" versus \"bad\" dichotomy, revealing instead a \"complicated, extraordinary, charismatic man\" who navigated a turbulent historical era with political ruthlessness.",

        "title": "The princes in the Tower: why was their fate never explained?",
        "content": "This article was first published in the October 2013 issue of BBC History Magazine Ad Locked in the Tower in June 1483 with his younger brother, the 12-year-old Edward V was certain  that death was facing him . Two overthrown kings had died in suspicious circumstances already that century. Yet it was still possible their uncle, Richard III, would spare them. The princes were so very young, and if it were accepted that they were bastards, as their uncle claimed, they would pose little threat. The innocent Richard, Duke of York, only nine years old, remained  joyous  and full of  frolics , even as the last of their servants were dismissed. But the boys were spotted behind the Tower windows less and less often, and by the summer s end they had vanished. It is the fact of their disappearance that lies at the heart of the many conspiracy theories over what happened to the princes. Murder was suspected, but without bodies no one could be certain even that they were dead. Many different scenarios have been put forward in the years since. In the nearest surviving contemporary accounts, Richard is accused of ordering their deaths, with the boys either suffocated with their bedding, or drowned, or killed by having their arteries cut. There were also theories that one or both of the princes escaped. In more modern times, some have come to believe that Richard III was innocent of ordering the children s deaths and instead spirited his nephews abroad or to a safe place nearer home, only for them to be killed later by Henry VII who feared the boys  rival claims to the throne. None of these theories, however, has provided a satisfactory answer to the riddle at the heart of this mystery: the fact the boys simply vanished. If the princes were alive, why did Richard not say so in October 1483, when the rumours he had ordered them killed were fuelling a rebellion? If they were dead, why had he not followed earlier examples of royal killings? The bodies of deposed kings were displayed and claims made that they had died of natural causes, so that loyalties could be transferred to the new king. That the answer to these questions lies in the 15th century seems obvious, but it can be hard to stop thinking like 21st-century detectives and start thinking like contemporaries. To the modern mind, if Richard III was a religious man and a good king, as many believe he was, then he could not have ordered the deaths of two children. But even good people do bad things if they re given the right motivation. In the 15th century it was a primary duty of good kingship to ensure peace and national harmony. After his coronation, Richard III continued to employ many of his brother Edward IV s former servants, but by the end of July 1483 it was already clear that some did not accept that Edward IV s sons were illegitimate and judged Richard to be a usurper. The fact the princes remained a focus of opposition gave Richard a strong motive for having them killed   just as his brother had killed the king he deposed. The childlike, helpless, Lancastrian Henry VI was found dead in the Tower in 1471, after more than a decade of conflict between the rival royal Houses of Lancaster and York. It was said he was killed by grief and rage over the death in battle of his son, but few can have doubted that Edward IV ordered Henry s murder. Henry VI s death extirpated the House of Lancaster. Only Henry VI s half nephew, Henry Tudor, a descendent of John of Gaunt, founder of the Lancastrian House, through his mother s illegitimate Beaufort line, was left to represent their cause. Trapped in European exile, Henry Tudor posed a negligible threat to Edward IV. However, Richard was acutely aware of an unexpected sequel to Henry VI s death. The murdered king was acclaimed as a saint, with rich and poor alike venerating him as an innocent whose troubled life gave him some insight into their own difficulties. Miracles were reported at the site of his modest grave in Chertsey Abbey, Surrey. One man claimed that the dead king had even deigned to help him when he had a bean trapped in his ear, with said bean popping out after he prayed to the deposed king. Edward IV failed to put a halt to the popular cult and Richard III shared his late brother s anxieties about its ever-growing power. It had a strong following in his home city of York, where a statue of  Henry the saint  was built on the choir screen at York Minster. In 1484 Richard attempted to take control of the cult with an act of reconciliation, moving Henry VI s body to St George s Chapel, Windsor. In the meantime, there was a high risk the dead princes too would attract a cult, for in them the religious qualities attached to royalty were combined with the purity of childhood. An insecure king In England we have no equivalent today to the shrine at Lourdes in France, visited by thousands of pilgrims every year looking for healing or spiritual renewal. But we can recall the vast crowds outside Buckingham Palace after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Imagine that feeling and enthusiasm in pilgrims visiting the tombs of two young princes and greatly magnified by the closeness people then felt with the dead. It would have been highly dangerous to the king who had taken their throne. The vanishing of the princes was for Richard a case of least said, soonest mended, for without a grave for them, there could be no focus for a cult. Without a body or items belonging to the dead placed on display, there would be no relics either. Nevertheless, Richard needed the princes  mother, Elizabeth Woodville, and others who might follow Edward V, to know the boys were dead, in order to forestall plots raised in their name. According to the Tudor historian Polydore Vergil, Elizabeth Woodville fainted when she was told her sons had been killed. As she came round,  She wept, she cryed out loud, and with lamentable shrieks made all the house ring, she struck her breast, tore and cut her hair.  She also called for vengeance. Elizabeth Woodville made an agreement with Henry Tudor s mother, Margaret Beaufort, that Henry should marry her daughter, Elizabeth of York, and called on Edwardian loyalists to back their cause. The rebellion that followed in October 1483 proved Richard had failed to restore peace. While he defeated these risings, less than two years later at the battle of Bosworth, in August 1485, he was betrayed by part of his own army and was killed, sword in hand. The princes were revenged, but it soon became evident that Henry VII was in no hurry to investigate their fate. It is possible that the new monarch feared such an investigation would draw attention to a role in their fate played by someone close to his cause   most likely Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham. The duke, who came from a Lancastrian family, was a close ally of Richard in the overthrow of Edward V, but later turned against the king. Known as a  sore and hard dealing man , it is possible he encouraged Richard to have the princes murdered, planning then to see Richard killed and the House of York overthrown. Richard executed Buckingham for treason in November 1483, but Buckingham s name remained associated at home and abroad with the princes  disappearance. What is certain, however, is that Henry, like Richard, had good reasons for wishing to forestall a cult of the princes. Henry s blood claim to the throne was extremely weak and he was fearful of being seen as a mere king consort to Elizabeth of York. To counter this, Henry claimed the throne in his own right, citing divine providence   God s intervention on earth   as evidence that he was a true king (for only God made kings). A key piece of vidence used in support of this idea was a story that, a few months before his murder,  the saint  Henry VI had prophesised Henry Tudor s reign. It would not have been wise to allow Yorkist royal saints to compete with the memory of Henry VI, whose cult Henry VII now wished to encourage. In 1485, therefore, nothing was said of the princes  disappearance, beyond a vague accusation in parliament during the autumn that Richard III was guilty of  treasons, homicides and murders in shedding of infants  blood . No search was made for the boys  bodies and they were given no rite of burial. Indeed even the fate of their souls was, seemingly, abandoned. I have not found any evidence of endowments set up to pay for prayers for the princes that century. Henry may well have feared the churches where these so-called  chantries  might be established would become centres for the kind of cult he wanted to avoid. But their absence would have struck people as very strange. Praying for the dead was a crucial part of medieval religion. In December 1485 when Henry issued a special charter refounding his favourite religious order, the Observant Friars, at Greenwich, he noted that offering masses for the dead was,  the greatest work of piety and mercy, for through it souls would be purged . It was unthinkable not to help the souls of your loved ones pass from purgatory to heaven with prayers and masses. On the other hand, it was akin to a curse to say a requiem for a living person   you were effectively praying for their death. A surviving prince? The obvious question posed by the lack of public prayers for the princes was, were they still alive? And, as Vergil recalled, in 1491 there appeared in Ireland, as if  raised from the dead one of the sons of King Edward  a youth by the name of Richard . Henry VII said the man claiming to be the younger of the princes was, in fact, a Dutchman called Perkin Warbeck   but who could be sure? Henry was more anxious than ever that the princes be forgotten and when their mother, Elizabeth Woodville, died in June 1492, she was buried  privily  without any solemn dirge done for her obit . It has been suggested this may have reflected her dying wishes to be buried  without pomp . But Henry VII also asked to be buried without pomp. He still expected, and got, one of the most stately funerals of the Middle Ages. Elizabeth Woodville emphatically did not receive the same treatment. Much has been made of this in conspiracy theories concerning the princes (especially on the question of whether she believed them to be alive) but Henry s motives become clear when recalled in the context of the period. This was an era of visual symbols and display: kings projected their power and significance in palaces decorated with their badges, in rich clothes and elaborate ceremonies. Elizabeth Woodville, like her sons, was being denied the images of a great funeral with its effigies, banners and grand ceremonial. This caused negative comment at the time. But with Warbeck s appearance, Henry wanted to avoid any nostalgia for the past glories of the House of York. It was 1497 before Perkin Warbeck was captured. Henry then kept him alive because he wanted Warbeck publicly and repeatedly to confess his modest birth. Warbeck was eventually executed in 1499. Yet even then Henry continued to fear the power of the vanished princes. Three years later, it was given out that condemned traitor Sir James Tyrell had, before his execution, confessed to arranging their murder on Richard s orders. Henry VIII s chancellor, Thomas More, claimed he was told the murdered boys had been buried at the foot of some stairs in the Tower, but that Richard had asked for their bodies to be reburied with dignity and that those involved had subsequently died so the boys  final resting place was unknown   a most convenient outcome for Henry. While the princes  graves remained unmarked, the tomb of Henry VI came to rival the internationally famous tomb of Thomas Becket at Canterbury as a site of mass pilgrimage. Henry ran a campaign to have his half-uncle beatified by the pope, which continued even after Henry s death, ending only with Henry VIII s break with Rome. The Reformation then brought to a close the cult of saints in England. Our cultural memories of their power faded away, which explains why we overlook the significance of the cult of Henry VI in the fate of the princes. In 1674, long after the passing of the Tudors, two skeletons were recovered in the Tower, in a place that resembled More s description of the princes  first burial place. They were interred at Westminster Abbey, not far from where Henry VII lies. In 1933, they were removed and examined by two doctors. Broken and incomplete, the skeletons were judged to be two children, one aged between seven and 11 and the other between 11 and 13. The little bones were returned to the abbey, and whoever they were, remain a testament to the failure of Richard and Henry to bury the princes in eternal obscurity. The players in the princes  downfall Henry VI (1421 71) Succeeding his father, Henry V, who died when he was a few months old, Henry VI s reign was challenged by political and economic crises. It was interrupted by his mental and physical breakdown in 1453 during which time Richard, 3rd Duke of York, was appointed protector of the realm. Both men were direct descendants of Edward III and in 1455 Richard s own claim to the throne resulted in the first clashes of the Wars of the Roses   fought between supporters of the dynastic houses of Lancaster and York over the succession. Richard died at the battle of Wakefield in 1460 but his family claim to the throne survived him and his eldest son became king the following year   as Edward IV. Richard s younger son would also be king, as Richard III. Henry VI was briefly restored to the throne in 1470 but the Lancastrians were finally defeated at Tewkesbury in 1471 and Henry was probably put to death in the Tower of London a few days later. Edward IV (1442 83) Edward succeeded where his father Richard, the third Duke of York failed   in overthrowing Henry VI during the Wars of the Roses. He was declared king in March 1461, securing his throne with a victory at the battle of Towton. Edward s younger brother Richard became Duke of Gloucester. Later, in Edward s second reign, Richard played an important role in government. Edward married Elizabeth Woodville in 1463 and they had 10 children: seven daughters and three sons. The eldest, Elizabeth, was born in 1466. Two of the three sons were alive at the time of Edward s death   Edward, born in 1470, and Richard, born 1473. Edward is credited with being financially astute and restoring law and order. He died unexpectedly of natural causes on 9 April 1483. Elizabeth, Queen Consort (c1437 92) Edward IV s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, a widow with children, took place in secret in 1464 and met with political disapproval. The king s brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was among those allegedly hostile to it. The preference the Woodville family received caused resentment at court, and there was friction between Elizabeth s family and the king s powerful advisor, Hastings. On Edward IV s death in 1483, Gloucester s distrust of the Woodvilles was apparently a factor in his decision to seize control of the heir, his nephew. Elizabeth sought sanctuary in Westminster, from where her younger son, Richard, Duke of York, was later removed. The legitimacy of her marriage and her children was one of Gloucester s justifications for usurping the throne on 26 June. Once parliament confirmed his title as Richard III, Elizabeth submitted in exchange for protection for herself and her daughters   an arrangement he honoured. After Richard III s death at the battle of Bosworth, her children were declared legitimate. Her eldest, Elizabeth of York, was married to Henry VII, strengthening his claim to the throne. Edward V (1470 83) & Richard, Duke of York (1473 83) Edward IV s heir was his eldest son, also named Edward. When the king died unexpectedly, his will, which has not survived, reportedly named his previously loyal brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as lord protector. On hearing of his father s death, the young Edward and his entourage began a journey from Ludlow to the capital. Gloucester intercepted the party in Buckinghamshire. Gloucester, who claimed the Woodvilles were planning to take power by force, seized the prince. On 4 May 1983, Edward entered London in the charge of Gloucester. Edward s coronation was scheduled for 22 June. On 16 June, Elizabeth was persuaded to surrender Edward s younger brother, Richard, apparently to attend the ceremony. With both princes in his hands, Gloucester publicised his claim to the throne. He was crowned as Richard III on 6 July and a conspiracy to rescue the princes failed that month. By September, rebels were seeing Henry Tudor as a candidate for the throne, suggesting the princes were already believed to be dead. Richard III (1452 85) Richard was the youngest surviving son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and was still a child when his 18-year-old brother became Edward IV after Yorkist victories. Unlike his brother George (executed for treason in the Tower in 1478   allegedly drowned in a butt of malmsey wine), Richard was loyal to Edward during his lifetime. On his brother s death, he moved swiftly to wrest control of his nephew Edward from the boy s maternal family, the Woodvilles. At some point in June 1483 his role moved from that of protector to usurper. He arrested several of the previous king s loyal advisors, postponed the coronation and claimed Edward IV s children were illegitimate because their father had been pre-contracted to marry another woman at the time of his secret marriage to Elizabeth. Richard was crowned, but he faced rebellion that year and further unrest the next. Support for the king decreased as it grew for Henry Tudor, the rival claimant who returned from exile and triumphed at the battle of Bosworth in 1485. Henry VII (1457 1509) Henry Tudor was the son of Margaret Beaufort (great-great-granddaughter of Edward III) and Edmund Tudor, half-brother of Henry VI. In 1471, after Edward IV regained the throne, Henry fled to Brittany, where he avoided the king s attempts to have him returned. As a potential candidate for the throne through his mother s side, Henry became the focus for opposition to Richard III. After the failed 1483 rebellion against the king, rebels, including relatives of the Woodvilles and loyal former members of Edward IV s household, joined him in Brittany. In 1485 Henry Tudor invaded, landing first in Wales, and triumphed over Richard III at Bosworth on 22 August. Ad Henry was crowned on the battlefield with Richard s crown. The following year he further legitimised his right to rule by marrying Elizabeth of York. When the king died in 1509, his and Elizabeth s son came to the throne as Henry VIII.

        "target_summary": "The chilling disappearance of Edward V, a mere 12-year-old king, and his younger brother, Richard, Duke of York, from the formidable Tower of London in the summer of 1483 remains one of history's most enduring and haunting enigmas. Imprisoned by their uncle, Richard III, the young princes were last seen behind the Tower windows before vanishing entirely, leaving an eerie silence and a void at the heart of countless conspiracy theories. Though murder was widely suspected, the absence of bodies meant no definitive proof of their fate, fueling centuries of speculation.\n\nContemporaries quickly pointed fingers at Richard III, accusing him of orchestrating their deaths through various gruesome means. Yet, alternative theories have emerged over time, suggesting the princes either escaped or were later killed by Henry VII, who ascended the throne after defeating Richard. The lack of a satisfactory answer, however, lies in the singular fact of their disappearance and the subsequent silence surrounding it. If alive, why did Richard not present them to quell the rebellions fueled by rumors of their deaths? If dead, why did he not follow the established tradition of displaying royal bodies to consolidate power, claiming natural causes? The answers, it seems, are rooted in the complex political and spiritual landscape of the 15th century, a world far removed from modern sensibilities.\n\nFor Richard III, a king with a fragile grip on a usurped throne, the princes represented a constant threat. Their very existence provided a rallying point for opposition, much like his brother, Edward IV, had eliminated the Lancastrian Henry VI to secure his own reign. But Richard faced a unique dilemma: the murdered Henry VI had, unexpectedly, become a venerated saint, his humble grave a site of miracles and popular devotion, even inspiring a statue in York Minster. This burgeoning cult presented a significant challenge to the ruling house. Richard, acutely aware of this precedent, would have dreaded the possibility of his young nephews becoming similar martyrs, their innocence combined with royal blood forming a potent, dangerous cult that could undermine his authority. Thus, their vanishing served a practical purpose: without a grave, there could be no focal point for such a cult, no relics to inspire devotion.\n\nYet, Richard also needed their mother, Elizabeth Woodville, and potential loyalists to believe the boys were dead to prevent plots. Tudor historian Polydore Vergil recounts Woodville’s intense grief and her subsequent alliance with Henry Tudor’s mother, Margaret Beaufort, to challenge Richard. This alliance ultimately led to Richard’s downfall and death at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.\n\nThe mantle of responsibility, or at least the need for strategic ambiguity, then passed to Henry VII, the new Tudor monarch. His claim to the throne was tenuous, and he too harbored strong motives for keeping the princes’ fate shrouded in mystery. An investigation might expose the involvement of allies, such as the Duke of Buckingham, who had initially supported Richard but later betrayed him. More crucially, Henry, like Richard, needed to prevent any burgeoning cult around the Yorkist princes. He wished to foster the cult of his own saintly ancestor, Henry VI, as a means of legitimizing his rule, and a rival Yorkist cult would be detrimental.\n\nConsequently, Henry VII consciously suppressed any public recognition or prayers for the princes. The absence of traditional requiem masses for the dead would have seemed profoundly strange in medieval society, subtly implying they might still be alive. This ambiguity was only heightened by the emergence of Perkin Warbeck in 1491, claiming to be the younger prince, Richard. Henry VII vehemently dismissed Warbeck as an impostor, but the challenge underscored his anxiety. He further demonstrated his desire to erase any lingering nostalgia for the House of York by denying Elizabeth Woodville a grand funeral, ensuring no public display could serve as a visual symbol of past glories.\n\nLater, convenient confessions from figures like Sir James Tyrell and accounts from Thomas More emerged, subtly crafted to reinforce Richard III's guilt and explain away the lack of bodies by claiming they were buried in an unknown location after an initial hasty burial. These narratives served the Tudor regime well.\n\nThe mystery persisted for centuries. Then, in 1674, two skeletons, believed to be children aged between seven and thirteen, were discovered at the foot of a staircase in the Tower, eerily matching More’s description of their initial burial site. These bones, later re-interred in Westminster Abbey, provide a poignant physical testament to the children’s tragic end. Yet, even with this discovery, the definitive truth of who ordered their deaths and precisely how they vanished remains elusive, a haunting echo of 15th-century power struggles and the ruthless pursuit of a crown. Their unmarked graves, despite the later reburial, ultimately symbolize the failure of both Richard and Henry to consign the princes to eternal obscurity, ensuring their story would forever captivate and confound.",

        "title": "Richard III tomb design unveiled by Leicester Cathedral",
        "content": "The  1.3m plans, which will be submitted to planning officials, would see the former king s remains reinterred in a tomb on a floor inlaid with a large white rose. Ad The top of the tomb would be inclined towards the east, as a symbol of the resurrection of the dead. Carved into the dark circular band on the floor around the tomb would be the name of the king, the dates of his birth and death (1452 85), his personal motto,  Loyaulte me Lie  (Loyalty binds Me), and his badge, which depicts a boar. The tomb would be positioned in a special area created by re-ordering part of the interior of Leicester Cathedral. The area would be defined by wooden screens between the new altar under the tower and a new chapel, which will be used for private prayer and for regular daily worship. The tomb would be situated in what is now the chancel of the cathedral, a traditional place of honour. This is equivalent to the position of the king's original grave in the Grey Friars Priory. The plans, which would also see changes to lighting and the fitting of new stained glass windows, will be submitted to the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England (CFCE). The CFCE is a national body that determines applications for approval of works. A decision is expected by the end of October. Work on the tomb has been complicated by a legal challenge from descendants of the king s relatives, who want to see Richard s remains buried in York. The 15-strong Plantagenet Alliance says Richard regarded York as his home. Last month a High Court judge gave permission for the alliance to challenge plans to rebury the king s remains in Leicester. A judicial review is likely to take place later this year in London, and is expected to last a full day. The justice secretary, Chris Grayling, will defend the decision to bury Richard s remains in Leicester, his department this week confirmed. Announcing the plans for the tomb yesterday afternoon, the dean of Leicester, the Very Reverend David Monteith, said: \"We fully respect the process of the judicial review which will ensure the procedure leading to the reinterment is correct.  While this takes its course we must, as would any cathedral in this position, seek planning permission for the detailed and costly changes which need to be made to the building.  The overall concept is regal and respectful in its elegant simplicity, as befits the final resting place of a king of England. By placing the tomb in our chancel, we are giving King Richard the same honour as did those friars more than 500 years ago.\" Dr Phil Stone, chair of the Richard III Society, said: \"Because of the judicial review, the Society must stick by its neutrality.  If in two to three months  time it is clear that Richard is coming to Leicester then I hope this will proceed according to these plans.  This design is utterly inspired and if it does not come here, I hope they will do the same thing somewhere else.\" Richard's skeleton was discovered underneath a Leicester council car park last September, 527 years after he was killed at the battle of Bosworth. The remains were in February identified as those of the last Plantagenet king and, as an organisation closely involved in the discovery, the University of Leicester holds a Ministry of Justice licence that allows it to decide where the remains are reinterred. The university decided on Leicester Cathedral. Ad What do you think of the plans for the tomb? Share your views by commenting below, or posting a message on Twitter or Facebook.",

A dark circular band encircling the tomb will be carved with the King's name, his birth and death dates (1452-85), his personal motto, \"Loyaulte me Lie\" (Loyalty binds Me), and his distinctive boar badge.\n\nThe grand scheme involves re-ordering a significant part of the cathedral's interior to create a special area for the tomb. This space will be respectfully delineated by elegant wooden screens, connecting a new altar under the tower with a newly designed chapel intended for private prayer and daily worship. This placement within the chancel, a traditional site of honour, mirrors the king's original grave at Grey Friars Priory. Further enhancements include updated lighting and the installation of new stained glass windows. These comprehensive plans await approval from the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England, with a decision anticipated by the end of October.\n\nHowever, the path to reinterment is currently complicated by a legal challenge from the 15-strong Plantagenet Alliance, descendants who fervently advocate for Richard's burial in York, citing his strong ties to the city. A High Court judge has permitted this challenge, and a full-day judicial review is expected later this year, with the Justice Secretary defending Leicester's claim.\n\nDespite this legal uncertainty, the University of Leicester, holding the Ministry of Justice license due to its role in discovering the King's skeleton last September, firmly decided on Leicester Cathedral as the reinterment site.

He had established a reputation as a supremely competent administrator, who concentrated power in his own hands and maintained his popularity through building works, bread and circuses. Ad Among one group, however, Emperor Domitian s name was mud. For the traditional aristocracy, his contempt for the Senate was simply too much to bear. And, as the 15th anniversary of his accession approached, a group of disaffected patricians decided that it was time to act. : The 8 bloodiest Roman emperors in history At midday on 18 September, the emperor seemed in a restless mood. According to the historian Suetonius, an astrologer had warned him that he would die around midday, so he was never at his best during lunchtime. At one point, Domitian distractedly asked a servant boy what time it was. Well after noon, the boy said. Relieved, the emperor sat down to work, poring over his state papers. At that moment, he was approached by a servant, one Stephanus. For some days, Stephanus had been wearing bandages, supposedly after an accident. In fact, the bandages were concealing a dagger, which he now produced behind his back. He handed the emperor another document, and as Domitian began to read, Stephanus stabbed him violently in the groin. More servants clustered around; more blows fell. In the confusion, Stephanus himself was mortally wounded. But by now, Domitian s robes were scarlet with blood. A few moments later, the last of the Flavian emperors was dead.

Seizing his moment, Stephanus violently stabbed the emperor in the groin, triggering a chaotic flurry of further blows from other conspirators. Domitian, the last Flavian emperor, succumbed to his wounds, his robes stained scarlet with blood.",

        "content": "In Tudor England, maintaining the difference between ranks was so important to the concept of a well-ordered society that efforts were made to enshrine the distinctions between the classes in  sumptuary  laws. These laws tried to control what you ate and wore, according to your position in the God-given hierarchy, which stretched from the king at the top, down through the numerous grades of nobility and clergy, to the gentry, yeomen and finally the labourers at the bottom of the heap. Ad Of course, for the poorest, sumptuary laws were not terribly relevant. Labourers would not often be able to afford more than pottage   the staple dish   and you could eat as much of that as your budget would allow. The rich ate pottage too, but instead of what was basically cabbage soup with some barley or oats   and a sniff of bacon if you were lucky   a nobleman s pottage might contain almonds, ginger and saffron, as well as wine. However, for aspiring courtiers who spent fortunes trying to outdo one other in lavish display, the sumptuary law was very relevant indeed. Failure to obey it could earn you a fine, as well as contempt for trying to  ape your betters . In theory, even the nobles were supposed to limit the amount spent on food each year to about 10 per cent of their capital, although that was for their immediate family, and did not include the amount to be spent on the household. The other rule to take into account was the strict observance of fasting on Fridays, Saturdays and, sometimes, Wednesdays too. Fasting did not mean going without food altogether, just eschewing flesh, and, in Lent, butter, eggs and dairy foods as well. Children, pregnant women and the elderly were not expected to fast, however, and it was possible to obtain a dispensation from fasting, but this was exceptional. Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, was hauled before the King s Council and severely reprimanded in 1543 for flagrantly eating meat during Lent. He was either deliberately risking an accusation of heresy (the reformed church being inclined to see fasting as superstitious), or he actively disliked fish. Pocket permitting, meat was replaced by an extraordinary array of fish and other seafoods, including seal and porpoise, the latter apparently a great favourite of Katharine of Aragon. Monarchs, although strictly observing the rules of fasting, were, of course, unlimited in what they could eat, or provide for their guests and courtiers. On flesh days at Henry VIII s court, a staggering range of meats and fowl would be enjoyed, including brawn, beef, mutton, bacon, goose, veal and lamb. Kid, hens, capons and peacocks also featured, as did cygnet, mallard, teal, woodcock, ousels, thrush, robins, cranes, bitterns, buzzards and venison of all sorts. Venison was the king of meats   not available to buy, it was hunted in the deer parks of the king and his nobles, and frequently given as a present. Henry VIII sent a hart to Anne Boleyn as a symbol of courtship. Four seasons Seasonality was a major factor in 16th-century diets. For small-scale farmers, there was insufficient feed to keep livestock over winter, so the majority were slaughtered   traditionally on Martinmas (11 November), and as much of the meat as possible was preserved. But no matter how thrifty the housewife, eking out the meat of a single pig through the whole winter with a few onions and leeks must have been a hard task. The wealthier landowners could keep more meat, slaughtering as needed. Game continued to be hunted throughout the winter by the wealthy, but poaching by the poor could mean hanging. Estimates suggest the Tudor nobility s diet was 80 per cent protein   one wonders how the digestive tract coped! Salads were eaten, often comprising a mixture of cooked and raw ingredients and including green vegetables such as leeks, onions, radishes and cabbage, as well as lettuce, chives, boiled carrots, flowers and herbs. They were dressed with oil, vinegar, and sometimes sugar. Turnips, consumed during the 15th and early 16th century, later fell out of favour, becoming considered fit only for cattle. Fruit was enjoyed, but with no refrigeration it could only be consumed in season, or preserved. Mary I was particularly fond of pears, and Elizabeth of York and Jane Seymour were great lovers of cherries. Henry VIII s new palaces were designed with plentiful orchards and fruit trees, including the new apricot trees, introduced in the 1540s. One of his last acts as king was to order new apple trees for his Privy Gardens. Most households served three meals a day, although breakfast, if eaten at all, was not substantial: it consisted of bread, perhaps with butter and sage, washed down with a small ale. The main meal of the day was dinner. In the first half of the century, 10 or 11am was the dining hour, but by the 1580s and 1590s it was becoming more usual to eat at around 12pm. In the houses of the rich, the meal could easily last a couple of hours. On ordinary days in any home of the middle class or above, dinner was divided into two courses, each consisting of several different dishes. A numbers game The Sumptuary Law of 31 May 1517 dictated the number of dishes per meal: a cardinal could serve nine dishes, while dukes, marquises, bishops and earls could serve seven. Lower-ranking lords were permitted to serve only six, and the gentry class, with an income of  40 100 per annum, could serve three. A dish contained a set amount of a particular item   for example, one swan, bustard or peacock (all reserved for the higher ranks of nobility), but four smaller fowl, or 12 very small birds, such as larks. To prevent the higher ranks feeling deprived if they went out to dinner, the host could serve the number of dishes and food appropriate to the highest-ranking guest. Additionally, weddings were exempt from the rules. Both courses would offer a pottage plus a selection of meats, custards, tarts, fritters and fruit. The first course tended to offer boiled meats, and the second, roasted or baked meats. For formal feasts, each course was heralded by the entrance of the  subtlety . This was an extraordinary decorative art form, the creation of wonderful representations of castles, cathedrals, hunting scenes or similar, made of marzipan and spun sugar for the most important feasts, and of wax for lesser occasions. In 1527, Cardinal Wolsey served a superlative feast for the French embassy, including subtleties of castles, of the church and spire of St Paul s, of  beasts, birds, fowls of diverse kinds, personages  some fighting  some leaping  some dancing , and a whole chess set of sugar paste, which the French delighted in so much it was boxed up and sent home with them. At court, following the two main courses was a third, consisting of spiced wine, known as hippocras; sweetmeats, comfits of all kinds, and wafers. Wafers, forbidden to all but the highest ranks, were thin, crisp biscuits made by pressing flavoured batter between hot irons. This course, eaten standing, was known as the  void , variously taken as meaning that the table had been cleared, or  voided , or that the course was eaten in a smaller room, thus  voiding  the hall. Supper, eaten at around 4 or 5pm outside court circles, was a much simpler affair. Meanwhile at court there were again two courses, each made up of numerous dishes. If this sounds like a huge amount of food, it is worth remembering that the lives of even the elite required far greater calorie intake than is necessary today: houses were extremely cold, with no carpets or curtains, and the only source of heat was a fire. Travel was on foot or horseback for most of the time, both of which require substantial amounts of energy. Hunting, hawking, dancing and archery are also energetic pastimes. Elizabeth I was famous for standing for hours, and walking long distances at a brisk pace with her ladies trailing behind her, complaining bitterly. Social customs In the medieval period, dining, like everything else, was a communal affair. Henry VII and Elizabeth of York frequently dined in public in the Great Hall, surrounded by the court. However, Henry VIII preferred to dine in his Presence Chamber   a half public, half private space   and frequently took supper in his private rooms with a few friends and his current wife. Elizabeth I followed this example, and, unless she was entertaining foreign dignitaries or was on progress, usually dined alone. At dinner in the Great Hall, whether in one of the royal palaces or the castle of a nobleman, the highest-ranking people sat at the top table, raised on a dais, with other tables arranged at right angles. A strict order of hierarchy was adhered to, with the higher-ranking people sitting at the table to the right hand of the top table, on both sides, moving down to the lowest ranking present at the furthest end of the table to the left of the top table. To make sure everyone was seated correctly, books of etiquette gave elaborate orders of precedence, even including instructions for the seating of the pope s foster-parents   woe betide the hostess whose steward got it wrong! Dining furniture consisted of trestles, which were stored when not in use. The highest-ranking person had a chair, but everyone else sat on benches. The table was covered with a cloth, and it was considered very poor manners to spill. The cost of clothes and the difficulty of laundering also added to the need to eat carefully. Food was shared in a  mess : a portion of each dish. At the top table, there was a mess between two (except the king and queen, who each had their own), but the lower ranks shared between four   two on either side of the table. Following her proxy marriage to James IV of Scotland, Margaret, daughter of Henry VII, shared a mess with her mother, Elizabeth of York, to demonstrate her new rank as a fellow queen. The highest-ranking person helped himself first. As eating was communal, it was important to follow the strict rules of etiquette: these were elaborate, yet practical, as they prevented anyone touching food that would be eaten by someone else. Everyone brought his own knife and spoon to the meal   forks being considered a fancy, foreign notion. The requirement for a personal spoon is behind the custom of giving one as a christening gift. The place setting was a trencher   made of silver, or even gold, for the king, then of lesser value material through to the standard ash, or, for the poorest, bread; together with a cup, a loaf of bread of appropriate quality (fine white for the lord, and coarse brown for lesser mortals). Among the upper classes a linen napkin was provided, which was draped over the left shoulder. Salt, being costly, was usually only seen on the top table. For soft foods, the diner would spoon some of the serving onto his trencher, being careful not to leave his spoon in the dish. Before taking a helping of anything else, he would wipe his spoon clean with bread. He would eat the food by dipping his bread into it, rather than spooning it up, so none of his saliva could enter the communal bowl. For meat, he would grasp the piece he wanted with the thumb and two fingers of his left hand, then sever it from the joint, using his knife in his right hand, again ensuring his fingers touched only his own portion. The food was lifted to the mouth in the thumb and fingers. Dinner in larger households was in relays. Once the master, family and guests had dined, the servants ate what was left. At court, after the king and queen and courtiers had finished, the senior servants would take their places, followed by the junior servants, before the tables were dismantled and stored for the next meal. If any food were left, it was given to the poor. Ad Melita Thomas is the editor of Tudor Times. To find out more, visit www.tudortimes.co.uk",
        "target_summary": "Tudor England meticulously upheld a rigid social hierarchy, a principle so fundamental it was codified in sumptuary laws designed to dictate one's diet and attire based on their God-given station. From the omnipotent king at the pinnacle to the humble labourer at the bottom, these laws aimed to prevent any audacious display of aspiration beyond one's means. While irrelevant to the poorest, who subsisted on simple pottage, these regulations intensely constrained aspiring courtiers who risked fines and social scorn for \"aping their betters\" in their lavish displays.\n\nThe daily sustenance of Tudors was a complex affair, heavily influenced by religious observance and social standing. Fasting was a regular imposition, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays, and during Lent, when not only flesh but also butter, eggs, and dairy were forbidden, though children, the elderly, and pregnant women were exempt. Even high-ranking figures like Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, could face royal wrath for flagrantly defying Lenten fasts, as he did in 1543, either out of defiance or a simple dislike for fish. For those who could afford it, abstaining from meat meant an extraordinary array of seafood, from familiar fish to exotic seal and porpoise, a particular favourite of Katharine of Aragon.\n\nMonarchs, however, transcended such restrictions. Henry VIII's court, on \"flesh days,\" presented a truly staggering bounty of roasted and boiled meats and fowl – brawn, beef, venison (the king of meats, a regal gift rather than a bought commodity), and a vast array of birds from peacocks and swans to humble robins.\n\nSeasonality profoundly shaped the Tudor diet. The cold winter months, lacking sufficient feed for livestock, necessitated a mass slaughter, traditionally around Martinmas, with much of the meat painstakingly preserved. Poorer households faced the daunting task of stretching a single pig's meat through the long winter, while the wealthy continued to hunt game, though poaching brought swift and brutal justice for the less fortunate. The Tudor nobility's diet, remarkably high in protein, was complemented by salads of both raw and cooked greens, often dressed with oil, vinegar, and sometimes sugar. Fruit was a seasonal delicacy, enjoyed fresh or preserved, with royal palates showing particular fondness for pears and cherries, prompting monarchs like Henry VIII to establish grand orchards, even introducing new apricots.\n\nMost households enjoyed three meals, though breakfast was a modest affair. Dinner, the day's main event, gradually shifted from mid-morning to noon, lasting for hours in wealthy homes. Sumptuary laws precisely quantified the number of dishes permitted per meal, mirroring social rank – a cardinal might feast on nine dishes, a duke on seven, while gentry with a modest income could only serve three. A \"dish\" itself varied, from a single magnificent swan (reserved for the highest echelons) to four smaller fowl or a dozen tiny birds.\n\nFormal feasts were transformed into breathtaking spectacles, heralded by \"subtleties\" – elaborate edible sculptures crafted from marzipan and spun sugar, depicting castles, cathedrals, or fantastical scenes. Cardinal Wolsey famously dazzled French ambassadors with an entire sugar paste chess set among other wonders. At court, following the two main courses, a final \"void\" course offered spiced wine, sweetmeats, and wafers – delicate biscuits forbidden to all but the highest ranks, eaten standing in a cleared hall or smaller room.\n\nThe immense quantity of food consumed was not mere gluttony; Tudor life demanded significant calories. Homes lacked insulation, and daily life involved arduous physical activity, from travel on foot or horseback to energetic pastimes like hunting, hawking, and dancing. Queen Elizabeth I herself was known for her tireless walking and long hours spent standing.\n\nDining customs reflected the shifting social landscape. While Henry VII often dined publicly in the Great Hall, Henry VIII and Elizabeth I increasingly sought privacy, dining in more intimate chambers with select companions. In grand halls, strict hierarchical seating prevailed: the highest-ranking guests occupied the raised dais, with others arranged by precedence along tables, books of etiquette prescribing every detail down to the pope's foster-parents.\n\nMeals were highly communal affairs, emphasizing strict, practical etiquette to maintain hygiene. Guests brought their own knives and spoons (forks were considered an exotic novelty), and place settings included a trencher (from silver or gold for royalty to simple bread for the poorest), a cup, and a loaf of bread appropriate to one's rank. Food was shared in \"messes,\" typically between two at the top table and four for lower ranks. Eating required meticulous care: spoons were wiped clean before each new dish, and food was dipped or lifted with fingers to avoid saliva contaminating communal bowls. Even cutting meat involved a precise grasp to ensure one touched only their own portion. After the master's party, servants dined in relays, and any remaining food was charitably distributed to the poor, a final gesture in a society where every meal was a testament to rank, ritual, and survival.",

        "title": "Richard III: latest DNA study  doesn t prove bones belong to former king",
        "content": "Michael Hicks, the recently retired head of history at the University of Winchester, told History Extra the new genealogical research  does not carry us any further forward . Ad The University of Leicester today announced that its latest analysis of all available evidence  confirms identity of King Richard III to the point of 99.999 per cent at its most conservative . The researchers collected DNA from living relatives of Richard III and analysed several genetic markers, including the complete mitochondrial genomes, inherited through the maternal line, and Y-chromosomal markers, inherited through the paternal line, from both the skeletal remains and the living relatives. The mitochondrial genome shows a genetic match between the skeleton and the maternal line relatives. However, Hicks said in response to the findings:  My line has always been that the bones may be Richard III s, but they cannot yet be proven to be. That is still the case, and is not altered [by this research].  The latest announcement is positive in that the bones are now linked to these two descendants of Richard III s sister Anne. We did not know that, but we had rather presumed this was so.  However, I don t think this research carries us any further forward. It tells us that the two modern relatives share the same mitochondrial DNA as the bones, not that the bones belong to Richard III.  Mitochondrial DNA is traced through the maternal line, and does not change over time. Richard III shared mitochondrial DNA with anyone in the direct female line from his sisters, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, great-great-grandmother etc. His mother had at least four sisters, leaving female descendants, Richard s great-grandmother, and others before her, currently unidentifiable.  Hicks told BBC History Magazine earlier this year that because mitochondrial DNA is traced through the maternal line, and does not change over time,  the DNA match from the Leicester skeleton could equally be the result of the bones being those of someone descended in the female line from Richard s mother, Cecily Neville, including her two daughters. \"It could also be those traceable from the other daughters of Cecily s mother, Joan Beaufort, any daughters of her grandmother Katherine Swynford, and so on.  Today, the historian added:  I m never convinced by DNA statistics: 99.999 per cent still leaves the possibility that two consecutive examples are the same.  There are two further problems with this data that cast doubt on its validity: the first is that the Y chromosome of the male line of the Plantagenets, represented by the Duke of Beaufort, should match with Richard III. There seems to be an assumption here that a break in the direct line male line must be in the Duke of Beaufort s family rather than in Richard s. Why not vice-versa?  If it doesn t match, it suggests the identification of Richard is wrong (and actually this has massive implications for the legitimacy of all English monarchs since Henry VII).  To clarify: one of the matches the researchers were seeking was between the Y chromosome from the bones and the Y chromosome of the male line of the Plantagenets, which today is represented by the Somerset family, including the Duke of Beaufort, who is descended via the bastard Charles Somerset from the Beaufort issue of John of Gaunt and thus Edward III. They did the test with various Somersets, which did not match the bones.  Leicester seems to say that the DNA from the bones are right, and that the Somerset line must have been broken by an illegitimacy   I thought the reverse as likely.  The article itself [published in the journal Nature Communications] allows for the possibility that the paternity break might be in either the descent of the bones or the Beauforts, but clearly prefers the former. It is perfectly possible to match in the female line   there must be dozens of Richard s contemporaries who do that   but not in the male line. Such persons, of course, are not Richard III.  The second problem is that we know what Richard looked like from the numerous portraits   black hair and brown eyes. I have previously criticised the reconstruction bust because, although the facial features may be scientific reconstructions from the skull, the colouring cannot be, and must have come from the portraits.  The suggestion that Richard was fair haired and blue eyed in his youth suggests the DNA of the modern descendants does not match the evidence of the best known portraits. Again, the assumption seems to be that the bones are Richard s, therefore the portrait that best fits the DNA results should be selected.  Leicester s latest findings were today published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications. Dr Turi King from the University of Leicester Department of Genetics, who led the research team, said:  Even with our highly conservative analysis, the evidence is overwhelming that these are indeed the remains of King Richard III, thereby closing an over 500 year old missing person s case.  In the video below, Professor Kevin Sch rer says: \"The fact that we have a break means just that   we have a break   it doesn't mean that the skeleton isn't Richard, because what we have is the very strong evidence triangulated with two living day relatives, with the mitochondrial DNA, so that in itself is very strong, compelling evidence that the skeleton is Richard III. \"The break, however, does raise other questions   more of a historical nature than 'is this skeleton Richard?'... this asks questions about the Plantagenets, and indeed the claims to the throne of both the houses of York and Lancaster.\"",
        "target_summary": "The University of Leicester has unequivocally heralded its latest analysis, asserting a 99.999% certainty in confirming the identity of King Richard III through DNA evidence. Researchers meticulously compared genetic markers from the excavated skeleton with those of living maternal and paternal relatives, finding a definitive match within the maternal mitochondrial DNA line.\n\nHowever, this pronouncement has been met with persistent skepticism from Michael Hicks, the recently retired head of history at the University of Winchester. Hicks, who has long maintained that the bones' identity remains unproven, contends that the mitochondrial DNA match is not exclusive to Richard III. He argues that numerous contemporaries, descending from Richard's mother or her female ancestors, could share the same mitochondrial DNA, thus rendering the match insufficient for conclusive identification.\n\nHicks further casts doubt on the findings by highlighting two critical issues. Firstly, and most significantly, a contentious mismatch exists in the Y-chromosome: the paternal DNA from the skeleton does not align with that of the Plantagenet male line, represented by the Duke of Beaufort's family. While Leicester's researchers infer an illegitimacy within the Beaufort lineage, Hicks vehemently questions this assumption, proposing that the break could equally signify that the bones are not Richard III's. He warns that this Y-chromosome discrepancy carries profound historical implications for the legitimacy of English monarchs stretching back to Henry VII. Secondly, Hicks points to a curious inconsistency in physical characteristics; the DNA suggests Richard may have been fair-haired and blue-eyed in his youth, directly contradicting the widely known historical portraits depicting him with dark hair and brown eyes, implying a selective interpretation of evidence.\n\nDespite Hicks' formidable objections, the Leicester team remains steadfast. Dr. Turi King, the lead researcher, asserts the evidence is \"overwhelming,\" effectively closing a centuries-old mystery. Professor Kevin Schürer acknowledges the Y-chromosome \"break\" but emphasizes it does not undermine the robust identification based on the strong, triangulated mitochondrial DNA evidence. Instead, he suggests this genetic anomaly raises intriguing historical questions concerning the legitimacy of the broader Plantagenet lineage, rather than the identity of the skeleton itself.",

        "title": "How did Tutankhamun die?",
        "content": "In 1922, Howard Carter and his team made what would become perhaps the greatest archaeological discovery of all time. It was the intact tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty: Tutankhamun. The  boy-king  has since become one of the most famous figures from the ancient world and his face   more particularly his golden death mask   provides us with one of the most iconic images from anywhere, and at any time. Ad The Valley of the Kings was the burial place of the pharaohs throughout the great era we now call the New Kingdom (1550 1069 BC), and its use helps to define the period. Fast-forward 3,000 years, and the valley was the site of a series of spectacular discoveries in the 19th and early 20th centuries AD. A map made by Napoleon s scientific expedition in the early 1800s recorded the position of 16 tombs. By the time of the First World War, that number had risen to 61. The great American lawyer and patron of work in the valley, Theodore Davis, was responsible for many of the more recent of these discoveries, but in 1914, after a couple of disappointing seasons, he declared the valley to be  exhausted . Carter, however, thought otherwise, believing there still to be tombs left undiscovered, including that of Tutankhamun. Under the patronage of the 5th Earl of Carnarvon he began excavations in the valley in 1917. After a few unproductive seasons, and with Carnarvon s patience very nearly exhausted, he made the greatest discovery of them all. Tutankhamun: Life, Death & Legacy Introducing a brand-new podcast series exploring the life and legacy of the boy pharaoh Tutankhamun Listen to all episodes now Although he does not appear in any contemporary king-lists, scholars were aware of Tutankhamun prior to Carter s masterstroke, and that he had reigned at least into a ninth year. He was believed, correctly, to have been a king of the Amarna period (when the pharaohs  residence was sited in the city of Amarna). He was also noted for his role in reintroducing the worship of the god Amun, following the reign of his predecessor and probable father, Akhenaten, who had abandoned traditional Egyptian polytheism and introduced worship centred on the god Aten. This much is revealed by the fact that Tut changed his name at some point from Tutankhaten to Tutankhamun. A scattering of decorated blocks bearing Tutankhamun s inscriptions showed that he had been a builder, but otherwise he remained shrouded in mystery. Although the contents of his tomb were astonishing, they did not lead to any great leaps forward in what we know about the king or his times. This led Carter to lament that  of what he was and what he did we are still sadly to seek . The one element of the discovery that had the potential to tell us most about the life and death of the king was his mummified body. Tutankhamun s remains have been studied at first-hand on four occasions. First, on 11 November 1925, the body was examined by Carter and a team of forensic experts led by Douglas Derry, an anatomist at the Government School of Medicine in Cairo. In 1968 a team from Liverpool University, headed by Ronald Harrison, produced a series of x-ray images of the mummy, which enabled Egyptologists to carry out a more detailed study than had previously been possible. Then, in 1978, Dr James Harris conducted a closer examination of the skull and teeth, with the help of new x-ray technology. Finally, in 2005, a team led by Dr Zahi Hawass performed a CT scan of the mummy and, in doing so, generated the most detailed images of the body yet. Studies have established that Tutankhamun died between the ages of 17 and 19 Collectively, these studies have established that Tutankhamun died between the ages of 17 and 19, more or less as Carter and Derry had concluded, and was between 1.6 and 1.7 metres (5ft 2in and 5ft 6in) tall. Beyond this, however, very little is certain. There has been a great deal of speculation about the various medical conditions that may have afflicted Tutankhamun during his lifetime, and to what extent these contributed to his death. Possibilities suggested over the years include general physical weakness, perhaps caused by in-breeding within the royal family (which almost certainly did occur); pectus carinatum, or pigeon chest; and even  Tutankhamun syndrome , with symptoms such as breast development, sagging abdominal wall and flat feet. Secondary evidence, such as the presence of walking sticks in the tomb, and Tutankhamun s representation in the art of the times, has sparked further speculation. The debate has also been influenced by depictions of Akhenaten, who was often shown as being a grotesque, almost deformed figure. Yet, no one knows whether this was an attempt to capture the likeness of a king genuinely suffering from some kind of illness or a mere artistic convention. Foremost among the theories on Tutankhamun s death   at least in terms of the amount of attention it has gathered   is the idea that he may have been the victim of foul play. During the 1968 investigation, Harrison observed a small piece of bone inside, and apparently detached from, the skull. This led him to suggest that the king may have suffered a blow to the head, and others to conclude that this was evidence that the boy-king had been murdered. In light of further scrutiny of Harrison s x-rays and the 2005 CT scan data, most experts now agree that the detached bone was the result of a postmortem, and nothing whatsoever to do with the king s demise. Yet this still hasn t prevented the theory taking hold that he was murdered. Dr Hawass s investigations in 2005 led to a new theory gaining traction. The CT scans revealed that the king had suffered a fracture to the left femur. Perhaps more important was the observation that an amount of embalming fluid had entered the break. This suggested that the wound that caused it was still open at the time of death, and also that there were no signs that it had started to heal. On this basis, the fracture probably occurred in the last few days of the king s life. While this alone could not have killed the king, Hawass s team has suggested that the wound may have become infected, and that it was this that finally finished Tutankhamun off. Yet, even this has failed to persuade everyone. In a recent book on the subject, Hawass notes that his theory was not shared by every member of the team. At this point, it s worth emphasising just how unusual Tutankhamun s mummy is. It displays a series of highly unusual features, particularly around the torso, where a number of the ribs and a section of the left pelvis are completely missing. The embalming incision through which certain internal organs would have been removed   as was standard   is in the wrong place and considerably larger than normal; much of the soft tissue inside the chest cavity was removed and replaced with rolls of linen; and the arms were crossed in an unusually low position. Finally, the heart, which would not normally have been removed and which was crucial for the survival of the individual into the afterlife, was missing. It was clear that if these anomalies were the result of some kind of injury, they might well provide the clues as to the cause of death. But one question we have to answer is to what extent these injuries might have been caused by Carter and his team when they removed the mummy from its nest of coffins. Carter s notes on the process, which are freely accessible online thanks to the magnificent efforts of our colleagues at the Griffith Institute in Oxford, are full of references to the difficulties in separating each of Tutankhamun s three coffins, first of all from the sarcophagus and subsequently from one another. (The two smaller coffins sat snugly inside the largest one in a  Russian doll  arrangement.) The mummy itself was a very tight fit for the innermost coffin, and was stuck fast to the inside by a layer of embalming oil, which had been poured over the king s body. The team tried various methods to loosen it, and even left it out in the sun in the vain hope that the heat would help to melt the oils. Derry s autopsy had, in the end, to be carried out while the mummy was still in the coffin and the death mask still in place. Tutankhamun s body was adorned with jewels and other precious paraphernalia, much of which the team had difficulty in removing. At the time the body was reinterred in the tomb, having finally been unwrapped and lain on a sand bed, the king was still wearing a skull-cap and a beaded necklace. By the time of Harrison s examination in 1968, both were missing. Harrison s x-rays showed clearly the damage to the thorax and missing ribs, but this was something that Derry had not observed. This has led some to suggest that at some point the mummy was illicitly disturbed in order that the skull cap and necklace could be stolen, and that the robbers removed a section of the human remains, including the missing ribs, in order to free the booty. However, it is perfectly possible that Derry was unaware that the ribs were missing given he did not have the benefit of x-rays. What s more, there is evidence that they were removed in ancient times: while some of the ribs were broken, others were cut smoothly, and the linen packing beneath them was undisturbed. Egyptologist W Benson Harer argues that the direction of the cuts suggest they could only have been made prior to the body being packed, and also that the bones must have been fresh when this took place, as older bone cannot be cut so cleanly. Harer also suggests that the king s torso was damaged in a massive accident, which forced the embalmers to remove the ribs, heart and perhaps other parts of the soft tissue to give the body a superficially normal appearance in preparation for mummification. This is persuasive. But what kind of accident could have brought this about? While filming a 2013 Channel 4 documentary examining the death and burial of Tutankhamun, we ascertained that the damage to the mummy seemed to be concentrated around the left-hand side of the torso, from the clavicle downwards, as far as the pelvis: a tall, blunt object, it seemed, had struck the king with great force. No weaponry we knew of could have caused the necessary injury. However, we felt that another theory was worth investigating again: the possibility that Tutankhamun died in a chariot accident, and that, more specifically, the fatal impact was caused by a chariot wheel. A team from Advanced Simtech   a company that, among other things, provides computer-generated simulations of car crashes for the UK courts   used a replica New Kingdom chariot to model the maneuverability and maximum speed that could be achieved using one of these vehicles. (Several chariots were found in Tutankhamun s tomb, and were a common feature of the iconography of kingship during the New Kingdom.) This information, and what is known of the king s height and likely weight, was then used to test a series of accident scenarios to establish whether any could have produced the injuries Tutankhamun sustained. Given the forces involved, it was not difficult to create a situation that would have led to serious injury. In almost all cases, however, the most serious injury sustained would have been to the head and neck, and as we have seen, the mummy presents no clear evidence of any such trauma. However, one scenario did appear to result in precisely the injuries we had observed in the mummy. Had the king been kneeling or crouching down and struck by the wheel of the chariot, he would undoubtedly have suffered massive injuries to his torso; and crucially   although the head would, on impact, have been thrown violently forward   it would, at the last moment, have been pulled away before striking the wheel. The victim would undoubtedly have suffered from whiplash but by this point that would hardly have mattered. A team from Cranfield University was called upon to help ascertain whether the injuries sustained in such an accident would have been enough to cause the king s death. To do this, we needed to know what the effect of a chariot wheel impacting the human rib cage at high velocity would be. The team modelled the forces involved and conducted a test using the rib cage and flesh of a pig procured from a local butcher. Unsurprisingly the test showed that the impact would puncture the ribs and that the wheel would have penetrated the soft tissue underneath by at least an inch or two, enough to cause massive internal damage. In modern times, had paramedics been on hand quickly enough, there is a chance that the victim of such an accident could survive. In New Kingdom Egypt this would not have been the case. We can only speculate as to how the king might have come to be in such a position. He may have fallen out of his own chariot and been picking himself up when another came careering into him from behind. Or could, just could, he have been killed in battle? It had been thought for a long time that Tutankhamun had never been actively engaged in war   there was no clear evidence for it. But that has now changed. Dr Raymond Johnson of the University of Chicago has spent many years studying the decorated blocks scattered throughout the temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor, which represent the remains of now-dismantled temples. Many of these appear to have come from monuments erected by Tutankhamun and, after years of painstaking work piecing together these vast jigsaw puzzles, Dr Johnson has concluded that the young king may well have been actively engaged in battle. Several scenes have emerged, apparently showing a military campaign in Nubia. Another shows Tutankhamun in a chariot leading the Egyptian forces against a Syrian-style citadel. This strengthens the possibility that Tutankhamun may have been injured in a chariot accident on the battlefield. We cannot know for certain that this is what happened, but it is as credible as any other hypothesis put forward so far, and provides an explanation for the mummy s most puzzling anomalies. We have no idea, in fact, how the vast majority of Egyptian kings died but it s perhaps worth noting also that, in most other cases, few people have cared enough to ask the question. Tutankhamun, by contrast, continues to fascinate us. In terms of his life and achievements, the king remains almost as obscure as he was before his tomb was revealed. And yet its contents, including the remains of the man himself, have, more than 3,000 years after his demise, made him one of the most famous individuals ever to have lived. Like all ancient Egyptians, Tutankhamun would have wished for that very Egyptian immortality encapsulated in the phrase  to cause his name to live . Whatever his Earthly achievements, whatever the circumstances of his life and death, he has perhaps been more successful in this than anyone else from that great civilisation.

        "target_summary": "Howard Carter's monumental 1922 discovery in Egypt's Valley of the Kings unveiled the untouched tomb of Tutankhamun, an 18th Dynasty pharaoh whose golden death mask and iconic image would forever captivate the world. This unprecedented find came after earlier patrons had declared the burial ground \"exhausted.\" Yet, under the patronage of the 5th Earl of Carnarvon, Carter persevered, convinced of more hidden secrets, leading to this extraordinary archaeological triumph.\n\nDespite the tomb's astonishing contents, Tutankhamun's brief reign remained largely enigmatic. Scholars knew he ruled during the Amarna period, reinstated traditional Amun worship after his probable father Akhenaten's monotheistic reforms, and changed his name from Tutankhaten. While evidence hinted at his role as a builder, his life and deeds were still \"sadly to seek,\" making his mummified body the primary key to understanding him.\n\nOver decades, the boy-king's mummy underwent meticulous scientific scrutiny. Initial examinations in 1925, followed by X-rays in 1968 and 1978, and a comprehensive CT scan in 2005 led by Dr. Zahi Hawass, collectively established his age at death (17-19) and height. Speculation about his demise ranged from genetic weaknesses due to royal in-breeding to a debunked murder theory based on a detached skull fragment. The 2005 CT scans offered a new hypothesis: a fractured left femur, unhealed at death, suggesting a fatal infection as the immediate cause.\n\nHowever, Tutankhamun's mummy presented perplexing anomalies: missing ribs, part of the left pelvis, a misplaced embalming incision, and a conspicuously absent heart – crucial for the afterlife. While some initially attributed damage to Carter's difficult unwrapping process, Egyptologist W. Benson Harer proposed that these precise, clean cuts, made when the bones were fresh, indicated a massive accident *before* embalming, necessitating the removal of body parts to reconstruct a presentable form. This theory provided a compelling backdrop for a 2013 documentary, which, through computer simulations, explored the possibility of a chariot accident.\n\nThe simulations revealed that if Tutankhamun had been kneeling or crouching and struck by a chariot wheel, he would have suffered devastating, concentrated torso injuries, consistent with the mummy's state, while his head, though violently impacted, would have been pulled away at the last moment. Further strengthening this hypothesis, Dr. Raymond Johnson's recent research, meticulously reassembling fragmented temple blocks, has unveiled scenes depicting Tutankhamun actively leading military campaigns, even against a Syrian-style citadel. This new evidence lends significant credence to the idea that the boy-king might have met his violent end in a chariot accident on the battlefield.\n\nDespite the enduring mystery surrounding his life and death, Tutankhamun's astounding discovery and iconic status have transcended millennia, granting him a unique and unparalleled form of immortality. His name, more than any other from that ancient civilization, truly lives on.",

        "content": "Through isotope analysis of his bone and tooth material, researchers have uncovered previously unknown details about Richard III s earlier life, as well as evidence of change in the king s diet in later years. Ad The cutting-edge research, undertaken by the British Geological Society, looked at chemicals from the teeth, femur and ribs. The findings show there were substantial chemical changes in the king s rib bone, which renews itself relatively quickly and therefore provides an insight into the last two to five years of the king s life. The study is the most complete to have been conducted on a medieval monarch, providing a much more detailed insight into the diet and lifestyle of Britain s last Plantagenet king. The research also offers an insight into the different kinds of environments Richard lived in during his life. The chemicals found in the teeth indicate a change of location in his early childhood, and researchers can confirm he had moved from Fotheringay Castle in eastern England by the time he was seven. And by examining the femur, which represents an average of the 15 years before death, researchers show that Richard moved back to eastern England as an adolescent or young adult, and had a diet that matched the highest aristocracy. Richard Buckley from the University of Leicester Archaeological Services, and lead archaeologist in the Richard III dig, said:  This cutting edge research has provided a unique opportunity to shed new light on the diet and environment of a major historical figure   Richard III. It is very rare indeed in archaeology to be able to identify a named individual with precise dates and a documented life.  This has enabled the stable-isotope analysis to show how his environment changed at different time in his life and , perhaps most significantly, identified marked changes in his diet when he became king in 1483.  The latest findings, which are published in Elsevier s Journal of Archaeological Science, will feature in a Channel 4 documentary on Sunday 17 August at 9pm, Richard III: The New Evidence.

        "content": "5 June 1832: Angry Parisians man the barricades Paris, 1832. In the Tuileries garden, the young writer Victor Hugo was strolling by the river when he heard gunshots: trouble was brewing in the working-class district of Les Halles. Hugo went to investigate. For 15 minutes he hid behind a pillar and watched as the king s soldiers fired on republican rebels. At last the battle moved away, giving Hugo the chance to make his escape. It was a moment that stayed with him for the rest of his life. Some 13 years later, he began work on a novel set in Paris during those tumultuous June days: Les Mis rables. Ad Today, thanks to the success of the musical and film versions, Les Mis rables is by far Hugo s best-known work. Many people assume that it is set during the French Revolution. In fact, the insurrection at its heart was a two-day uprising against the Orleanist king Louis-Philippe, which ended in failure. The June Rebellion was triggered by the food shortages of the late 1820s, a devastating cholera epidemic and the death of the popular general Jean Lamarque, who had become a hero to the working classes of Paris. At his funeral on 5 June, republican demonstrators rallied the crowds, waving red flags and calling for  liberty or death . The mood turned ugly, and by the evening rioters had taken control of much of central and eastern Paris, throwing up the barricades that play such a key role in Hugo s novel. It was all for nothing. The army stayed loyal to Louis-Philippe, and by morning the uprising had lost momentum. At the Clo tre Saint-Merri, the last demonstrators were surrounded by the king s troops. By nightfall it was all over. 26 June 1541: Francis Pizarro meets a bloody end over dinner Francisco Pizarro died as he had lived, sword in hand. Pizarro, who had defied the odds to bring down the Incas and conquer modern-day Peru for the Spanish, was almost 70 years old. As governor of New Castile (as Peru was then named), he had spent years locked in a bitter feud with a rival conquistador, Diego de Almagro. In 1538 Pizarro had had Almagro executed. But now the latter s son   also Diego   wanted revenge. Pizarro was dining in his palace in Lima when Almagro burst in with about 20 armed supporters. Most of the old man s guests fled, but Pizarro stood his ground, reaching for his sword from where it hung on the wall. According to one account, he struck down two would-be assassins and ran a third through. While he struggled to draw out his sword, however, Almagro s men stabbed him in the throat. Lying on the palace floor, Pizarro shouted:  Jesus!  The last thing he ever did was to draw a cross on the ground with his own blood and kiss it. The most ruthless conquistador of the age was dead. Pizarro s body was buried in Lima Cathedral, but it was not until 1977 that building workers found a lead box, bearing the inscription:  Here is the head of Don Francisco Pizarro Demarkes, Don Francisco Pizarro who discovered Peru and presented it to the crown of Castile.  Forensic scientists reported that the skull was broken by numerous violent blows   perhaps a fitting end for a man steeped in violence. Francisco Pizarro fights for his life in this 16th-century engraving. The Spanish conquistador died as he had lived   with his sword in his hand. (Bridgeman) 23 June 1940: Hitler crows over Paris It was about 5.30 in the morning when Adolf Hitler s plane landed at the edge of Paris. Three large Mercedes cars were waiting to take the conqueror into town, and the Nazi dictator knew exactly where he wanted to go first   the opera. As he told his minister, Albert Speer, Charles Garnier s neo-baroque opera house was his favourite building in Paris. And now that the French capital had fallen to Germany s all-conquering army, Hitler had the chance to live out a dream. Hitler s tour of Paris on 23 June 1940   the only time he visited the city   was one of the greatest days of his life. France lay prostrate at his feet, the shame of 1918 finally avenged. As he toured the city, posing for pictures by the Eiffel Tower, he discussed plans for a victory parade. Yet he concluded that it was a bad idea:  I am not in the mood for a victory parade. We aren t at the end yet.  Adolf Hitler takes in the sights of Paris in what would be the Nazi leader s only trip to the French capital.  Three hours in Paris  made him happy when he was at the height of his triumphs,  recalled Albert Speer. (AKG Images) To Speer, the Nazis  chief architect, Hitler waxed lyrical about the beauties of the French capital. But he was determined that Germany could do better.  Berlin,  he said later,  must be more beautiful. When we are finished in Berlin, Paris will be only a shadow.  Hitler s visit was astonishingly brief, and by nine in the morning he was already heading back to Germany.  It was the dream of my life to be permitted to see Paris,  he told Speer as they drove back to the airfield.  I cannot say how happy I am to have that dream fulfilled today.  Speer himself was struck by his master s mood.  For a moment,  he wrote later,  I felt something like pity for him: three hours in Paris, the one and only time he was to see it, made him happy when he stood at the height of his triumphs.  26 June AD 363: A Persian spear fells Rome's last pagan emperor In the spring of 363, the Roman emperor Julian invaded Persia. Having ruled Rome for less than two years, he felt that he needed to prove himself to the troops on the empire s eastern frontier. And what better way than by taking on their age-old enemies? On 5 March, around 60,000 Roman troops marched out of Antioch (near modern-day Antakya in Turkey), led by the emperor himself. At first everything went smoothly, and by mid-May Julian had crossed the Tigris and was outside the Persian capital, Ctesiphon. But then things began to go wrong. Harassed almost daily by Persian attacks, Julian ordered his army to retreat north, and at a minor engagement on 26 June, the worst happened. Julian had thrown himself into the fray, wrote Ammianus Marcellinus, a historian on the emperor s military staff,  when suddenly a cavalry spear, grazing the skin of his arm, pierced his side and fixed itself in the bottom of his liver . The wound did not at first seem serious; Julian s personal doctor washed it with wine, then tried to stitch up the organs. But the bleeding continued, and it became obvious that the emperor was failing. As he lay dying, wrote Ammianus, Julian  entered into an intricate discussion with the philosophers Maximus and Priscus on the sublime nature of the soul . This seems a bit unlikely. It was inevitable that the last non-Christian emperor would get short shrift from Christian writers, so Ammianus, a fellow pagan, was probably gilding the lily.  At last,  the historian went on,  the swelling of his veins began to choke his breath and, having drank some cold water, which he had asked for, he expired quietly about midnight, in the 31st year of his age.  16 June 1883: 183 children crushed to death in concert tragedy The poster for Sunderland s Victoria Hall seemed wonderfully enticing.  On Saturday Afternoon at 3 o clock,  it said,  the Fays from the Tynemouth Aquarium Will Give a Grand Day Performance for Children   The Greatest Treat for Children Ever Given.  There would, it added, be prizes,  a handsome Present, Books, Toys, &c . When Mr and Mrs Fay took the stage on 16 June 1883, an estimated 2,000 children were packed into the concert hall. The interior of the Victoria Hall in Sunderland, as depicted in a 19th-century illustration. The tragedy that befell the hall in 1883 touched the hearts of people across Britain, including Queen Victoria. (AKG Images) What followed was a tragedy of heartbreaking proportions. At the end of the show, an announcer declared that children with specially numbered tickets would get a prize on the way out. Meanwhile, performers began handing out treats to children in the front row. Many of the 1,100 children in the gallery rushed towards the stairs, worried they were going to miss out. At the bottom, however, they found a narrow door, bolted to allow only one child through at a time. As more children stampeded down the stairs, a crush began to develop. Parents rushed to help, but could not get near the door. Children started falling, bodies piling up near the door. By now it was obvious that a terrible disaster was under way. In all, 183 children died that day, some as young as three. In the aftermath, legislation provided for better emergency exits, with doors opening outwards, not inwards. Queen Victoria sent a heartfelt letter of condolence quoting the words of Jesus:  Suffer little children to come unto me... for such is the Kingdom of God.  18 June 1178: Monks witness an extraordinary lunar event On 18 June 1178, Gervase of Canterbury heard an extraordinary story. Gervase, who had been ordained by Thomas Becket, spent much of his time compiling a detailed chronicle of English history. But nothing could have prepared him for the account reported to him that night by five fellow monks. Some time after sunset, the monks had noticed something extraordinary in the sky.  Now,  Gervase wrote,  there was a bright new moon  its horns were tilted toward the east; and suddenly the upper horn split in two. From the midpoint of the division a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out, over a considerable distance, fire, hot coals, and sparks. Meanwhile the body of the moon which was below writhed, as it were, in anxiety, and to put it in the words of those who reported it to me and saw it with their own eyes, the moon throbbed like a wounded snake.  This extraordinary sight, he noted,  was repeated a dozen times or more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random and then returning to normal. Then after these transformations the moon from horn to horn, that is along its whole length, took on a blackish appearance. Today, many lunar experts believe the monks had been watching the formation of the moon s enormous Giordano Bruno crater, named after an Italian philosopher. It was probably created by the impact of an asteroid or comet, which would explain the burst of molten matter seen by the monks   though they, of course, had no way of understanding what it was they had witnessed. 11 June 323 BC: Alexander the Great dies after drinking binge Alexander of Macedon, master of the world from the shores of the Adriatic to the mountains of Afghanistan, spent the early summer of 323 BC in Babylon. Only a year before, his troops had persuaded him to turn back from a planned invasion of India. But already he was planning new conquests, hoping to strike at the heart of Arabia. On top of that, the 32-year-old king was pressing forward with his plans to integrate Persians and Macedonians, even urging his officers to take Persian wives. And then, some time around the beginning of June, disaster struck. Accounts of Alexander s death differ widely. The most popular, told by the historian Plutarch, holds that he was taken ill after a drinking session with his friend Medius of Larissa. In the next few days, Alexander developed a fever. Although he managed to put in an appearance before his worried troops, his condition worsened until he could no longer speak. At last, some time in the night between 10 and 11 June, he died. Mourners lament the death of Alexander the Great in this 14th-century copy of a fifth-century Armenian manuscript. Did he fall prey to typhoid, malaria or poison? (Alamy) Since so many Macedonian rulers fell victim to assassination, speculation has long surrounded Alexander s death. Many historians have suggested that he may have been poisoned by rivals within the Macedonian elite or by officers outraged by his Persian affectations. The true explanation may be more prosaic. In the festering heat of summer in Babylon, the hard-drinking Alexander may well have succumbed to typhoid or malaria. His death had a shattering impact. Within weeks the Macedonian empire was already falling apart, as his officers began to carve out their own rival dominions. Even Alexander s sarcophagus, hijacked and taken to Alexandria, became a weapon in the civil war.  I foresee great contests,  he is supposed to have said,  at my funeral games.  He was right. 4 June 1989: Hundreds die in Tiananmen Square By the beginning of June 1989, Tiananmen Square, in the centre of Beijing, was packed with demonstrators. After weeks of mounting protests, with students and dissidents at the forefront, the Chinese communist government had declared martial law and sent some 250,000 troops to the capital   but still the crowds refused to disperse. On 2 June party leaders, including the country s effective leader, Deng Xiaoping, agreed that it was time to crack down. Tiananmen Square, they agreed, must be cleared, so that  the riot can be halted and order restored to the capital . The following evening, 3 June, troops and tanks thundered into the centre of Beijing, as state television warned residents to stay in their homes. By about 10 o clock, reports were emerging of bloodshed at major intersections on the roads into the city. Inside Tiananmen Square, some 70,000 people stood and waited. Then, just after midnight, the first armoured vehicle appeared from the west. Some students threw stones and bricks, while others tried to prevent them; it was vital, they said, that their protest remained non-violent. What followed remains the single most controversial moment in China s recent history. In the early hours of 4 June, the army cleared the square by force. Government officials initially claimed the action resulted in no deaths   later revised to about 200; other estimates suggest that as many as 1,000 people lost their lives. Either way, the result was the same: the protesters had been defeated. One image, taken the next day, captured the terrible drama: a photograph of a lone man, holding two shopping bags, standing in front of a column of tanks. Who he was, and what he was doing, remains uncertain. At the time, there were rumours that he was arrested and dragged before a firing squad. We may well never know. Other notable June anniversaries 29 June 1613 When a cannon misfires during a performance of Henry VIII, accidentally igniting the theatre s thatched roof, the Globe Theatre in Southwark burns to the ground. 3 June 1937 In a chateau near Tours, the Duke of Windsor   formerly Edward VIII   marries Wallis Simpson. His brother, George VI, forbids his other brothers from attending the nuptials. 7 June 1494 Spain and Portugal agree a treaty to divide the New World between them, carving up the newly discovered Americas along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands. 9 June 1934 The world s most famous duck, Donald, makes his first appearance in the short Walt Disney cartoon The Wise Little Hen, based on the fairy tale of The Little Red Hen. 27 June 1358 Following the Treaty of Zadar, the Republic of Dubrovnik throws off Venetian rule and comes under the protection of Louis I of Hungary. 25 June 1978 Ad In San Francisco, the artist Gilbert Baker designs a hippie-influenced rainbow flag with eight stripes, to be flown during the city s Gay Freedom Day Parade.

        "target_summary": "June has long been etched with a spectrum of pivotal historical moments, from political turmoil and tragic disasters to scientific phenomena and personal destinies. In 1832 Paris, the young Victor Hugo found himself inadvertently embroiled in the violent June Rebellion. Witnessing firsthand the clash between royal soldiers and republican rebels who had erected barricades across the city, this failed working-class uprising—fueled by famine, cholera, and the death of General Lamarque—profoundly shaped Hugo, later inspiring his monumental novel, *Les Misérables*.\n\nAcross centuries, formidable leaders met dramatic fates. In 1541, the aging Francisco Pizarro, conqueror of Peru, met a fittingly brutal end in his Lima palace. Ambushed by the vengeful son of a rival he had executed, Pizarro fought valiantly, sword in hand, before being fatally stabbed, his final act drawing a cross in his own blood. Much earlier, in AD 363, Rome's last pagan emperor, Julian, died in Persia, mortally wounded by a cavalry spear during a retreat from an ambitious but ultimately ill-fated invasion. Similarly, Alexander the Great, master of a vast empire, died prematurely in Babylon in 323 BC at just 32. While some speculated poisoning, the hard-drinking king likely succumbed to typhoid or malaria, his sudden death immediately fragmenting his nascent dominion.\n\nThe 20th century witnessed its own significant June events. In 1940, Adolf Hitler made his only, albeit brief, visit to a defeated Paris, savoring a personal triumph over France. Touring the eerily quiet capital, he declared his dream fulfilled, vowing Berlin would one day surpass its beauty. Decades later, in 1989, Beijing’s Tiananmen Square became the site of a brutal government crackdown. Weeks of student-led protests culminated on June 4th as troops and tanks violently cleared the square, leading to hundreds, possibly thousands, of deaths and an enduring image of a lone individual defiantly facing armored vehicles.\n\nJune also bore witness to profound human tragedy and celestial wonder. Sunderland’s Victoria Hall experienced a heartbreaking disaster in 1883 when a stampede for prizes after a children's show resulted in 183 young lives lost in a crush at a narrow, inward-opening door. This horror spurred vital safety reforms in public venues. Centuries prior, in 1178, five Canterbury monks reported an astonishing lunar event: a new moon appearing to split, spewing fire and sparks, and writhing \"like a wounded snake.\" This dramatic spectacle is now believed to have been the cosmic impact that formed the massive Giordano Bruno crater, a raw display of the universe’s power observed by bewildered medieval eyes.",

        "title": "Elizabeth I s war with England s Catholics",
        "content": "In 1828, builders removing a lintel over a doorway at Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire were surprised to see an old, beautifully bound book come down with the rubble. They decided to investigate and knocked through a thick partition wall, exposing a recess, about 5 feet long and 15 inches wide. Inside, wrapped up in a large sheet, was an enormous bundle of papers and books that had once belonged to Sir Thomas Tresham, a Catholic gentleman in the reign of Elizabeth I. Ad There have been other discoveries in other counties: a secret room chanced upon by a boy exploring a derelict wing of Harvington Hall, near Kidderminster, in 1894; a small wax disc bearing the imprint of a cross and a lamb (an Agnus Dei), found in a box nailed to a joist by an electrician working in the attic of Lyford Grange, Berkshire, in 1959; and a  pedlar s chest  containing vestments, a chalice and a portable altar, bricked in at Samlesbury Hall, Lancashire. Each bears testimony to the resourcefulness and courage with which Catholic men and women tried to keep their faith in Protestant England. Under Elizabeth I, Catholics grew adept at concealment. Their lifeblood   the Mass   was banned. Anyone who heard it risked a fine and prison. Hence the need for secret Mass-kits and altar-stones small enough to slip into the pocket. Their priests   essential agents of sacramental grace   were outlawed. Reconciling anyone to Rome (and, indeed, being reconciled) was made treason. After 1585, any priest ordained abroad since 1559, and found on English soil, was automatically deemed a traitor and his lay host a felon, both punishable by death. Hence the need for priest-holes, like the one at Harvington Hall, or at Hindlip, where a feeding tube was embedded in the masonry.  | A perilous game of hide and seek: the history of priest holes and hunters Even personal devotional items like rosary beads or the Agnus Dei found at Lyford were regarded with suspicion, since a statute of 1571 had ruled that the receipt of such  superstitious  items, blessed by the pope or his priests, would lead to forfeiture of lands and goods. It is impossible to know how many Catholics there were in Elizabethan England, for few were willing to be categorised and counted. John Bossy (defining a Catholic as one who habitually, though not necessarily regularly, used the services of a priest) estimated some 40,000 in 1603, less than one per cent of the population. This was not a homogenous group, rather a wide and wavering spectrum of experience. Many were branded  church papists : they attended official services according to law, but some conformed only occasionally or partially. William Flamstead read his book during the sermon  in contempt of the word preached , while for two decades of attendance Sir Richard Shireburn blocked his ears with wool. Parishioners might refuse Protestant communion or they might hide the bread up their sleeve to dispose of later. Mrs Kath Lacy from the East Riding of Yorkshire trod it  under her foot . Other wives avoided church altogether and, since their husbands owned the property, they often escaped prosecution.  Such here have a common saying,  groused one Northamptonshire official in 1599,  the unbelieving husband shall be saved by the believing wife.  At the disobedient end of the spectrum were those individuals (8,590 recorded in 1603) who staunchly adhered to the Roman church s insistence that compliance was an insult to the faith. They were known as recusants (from the Latin recusare: to refuse) and they paid a high price for their  obstinacy . In 1559 the fine for missing church was 12 pence. In 1581 it was raised to a crippling 20 pounds. In 1587 enforcement became much stricter with the introduction of cumulative monthly fines and the forfeiture of two-thirds of a defaulting recusant s estate.Lord Vaux of Harrowden was reduced to pawning his parliamentary robes; poorer folk did not have that luxury. What recusants publicly requested   freedom of worship and the right to abstain from official church services   may not sound unreasonable, but this was the age of Inquisition, of conquistadors, religious wars and, in the case of Elizabeth s half-sister Mary I, human bonfires. Elizabeth was a divine-right queen with a sworn duty to maintain the one true faith but, unlike Mary, she had conformed during her predecessor s reign. She did not like  to make windows into men s hearts and secret thoughts  noted the oft-misquoted Francis Bacon, but she expected outward obedience, in church and state. Illegitimate pretender On 25 February 1570, Pope Pius V issued a bull of excommunication against Elizabeth I. In late support of the 1569 northern rebellion (led by the Catholic earls of Northumberland and Westmorland and crushed with ruthless efficiency   450 executions under martial law is the conservative estimate), the bull declared Elizabeth an illegitimate pretender and bound her subjects to disobey her, upon pain of anathema (a formal curse by the pope). A later resolution from Pius s successor, Gregory XIII, allowing for provisional obedience  under present circumstances , did not alter the fundamental message. It was impossible, wrote the Privy Council clerk, Robert Beale,  that they should love her, whose religion founded in the pope s authority maketh her birth and title unlawful . There was, indeed, some rancour towards the queen. In 1591, the recusant gentleman Swithin Wells retorted to a jibe about papists having been begotten by bulls with the words:  If we have bulls to our fathers, thou hast a cow to thy mother.  He swiftly apologised and the circumstances were exceptional: Wells was just about to swing for the crime of priest-harbouring. But even a self-fashioned loyalist like Sir Thomas Tresham privately entertained hostile views on the  bastardised  Elizabeth. Conflicted loyalties caused considerable anguish, as evinced by the desperately sad letter that the 24-year-old convert Robert Markham wrote to his parents in 1594.  Every hour presents a hell unto me  In the night, I cannot sleep or take any rest, so monstrous is the horror of my conscience.  He pledged never to fight against Elizabeth, nor to have any truck with conspiracy.  I am,  he declared,  and will be as good a subject to her Majesty as any in England.  But there had to be a caveat:  My conscience only reserve I to myself, whereupon dependeth my salvation.  Markham chose exile, like many others, some of whom became radicalised by the experience. The Catholics who stayed at home used various methods to sustain their faith, from spiritual reading, prayer and meditation to the preservation of rosaries and relics. They were advised to internalise their devotions. For instance, certain spots in the garden could be linked to different saints, so that walks would become,  as it were, short pilgrimages . But there was no substitute for the sacraments and, although some erstwhile Marian priests continued to minister in secret, it was only when William Allen s seminary boys started coming off the boats in 1574 that Catholic hopes   and government fears   were revived. The first English missionaries came from Douai in Flanders, where William Allen, the former principal of St Mary Hall, Oxford, had founded a college in 1568. In June 1580, they were joined in England by the Jesuits, members of a dynamic religious order founded in the furnace of the Reformation.  We travelled only for souls,  insisted Edmund Campion at his execution at Tyburn on 1 December 1581,  we touched neither state nor policy.  These were indeed the instructions that this Jesuit and his co-missioner, Robert Persons, had carried from Rome. But they were also armed with faculties to print books anonymously, they insisted upon absolute recusancy and they challenged the state to a public debate. Campion s  brag  chilled his adversaries:  Touching our Society, be it known unto you that we have made a league   all the Jesuits in the world, whose succession and multitude must overreach all the practices of England   cheerfully to carry the cross that you shall lay upon us and never to despair your recovery while we have a man left to enjoy your Tyburn, or to be racked with your torments, or to be consumed with your prisons. The expense is reckoned, the enterprise is begun; it is of God, it cannot be withstood. So the faith was planted, so it must be restored.  Campion was one of about 130 priests executed for religious treason in Elizabeth s reign. A further 60 of their lay supporters were also put to death. Torture was used more than in any other English reign. Margaret Ward, destined for the gallows for organising the escape of a priest, protested that  the queen herself, if she had the bowels of a woman, would have done as much if she had known the ill-treatment he underwent . But it was the heart and stomach of a king that were required for England s defence. Assassination attempts With no named successor, and a Catholic heir presumptive   Mary, Queen of Scots   waiting, wings clipped but ready to soar, Elizabeth I was vulnerable to conspiracy. The security of the realm depended entirely on her personal survival in an age that saw brother rulers taken by bullet and blade. The assassination in 1584 of William of Orange, the Dutch Protestant figurehead shot in the chest by a Catholic fanatic chasing the bounty of Philip II of Spain, was particularly alarming. The following year, parliament passed a statute licensing the revenge killing of assassins, or witting beneficiaries of assassins, in the event of a successful attempt on the queen s life. The threat from Spain, the papacy, the French house of Guise and the agents of Mary, Queen of Scots was very real and seemingly unceasing. From the sanctuary of exile, William Allen agitated for an invasion of England and frequently exaggerated the extent of home support. Only fear made Catholics obey the queen, he assured the pope in 1585,  which fear will be removed when they see the force from without . The priests, he added, would direct the consciences and actions of Catholics  when the time comes . In reality, there were very few Elizabethans willing to perpetrate what would now be called an act of terror. But there was a vast grey area that encompassed all kinds of suspicious activity   communication with the queen s enemies, the handling of tracts critical of the regime, the non-disclosure of sensitive information, the sheltering and funding of priests who turned out to be subversive. Even the quiescent majority was feared for what it might do if there was ever a confrontation between Elizabeth I and the pope. Catholic attempts on the queen s life Elizabeth s advisors foiled a series of assassination plots Spain plans an invasion, 1571 Named after the Florentine merchant who acted as the go-between for the Duke of Norfolk, Mary Stuart, Philip II and the pope, the Ridolfi plot was a plan for a Spanish invasion of England and the substitution of Elizabeth with Mary. Roberto Ridolfi was known to the English government and met with Elizabeth before heading for Rome. The plot was foiled upon the arrest of a courier at Dover. Norfolk was executed, Mary survived and Ridolfi later emerged as a papal senator. He clearly relished intrigue. Throckmorton s sorry end, 1583 Francis Throckmorton was the linkman for a plot that might be seen as part of a continuum of intrigues  by the powers of Catholic Europe in the 1580s. The aim, as with the Ridolfi plot, was the overthrow of Elizabeth and the restoration of Catholicism in England. Mary Stuart s kinsman, the Duke of Guise, was set to invade at Arundel, but the plan was aborted upon Throckmorton s arrest in November 1583. Throckmorton was  somewhat pinched  (ie tortured) and executed the following July. The lone extremist blows his cover, 1583 Not every attempt on Elizabeth s life strained the sinews of Europe s whisperers and watchers. John Somerville, a distant kinsman (by marriage) of William Shakespeare, seems only to have had a  frantic humour  and a pistol in his pocket when he set off from his home in Warwickshire to kill the queen. He failed because he broadcast his intentions en route, but, as events elsewhere proved (see page 54), it only took one extremist, bent on martyrdom and blind to worldly consequence, to effect an assassination. Walsingham ensnares Mary Stuart, 1586 The plot that brought down Mary Stuart was, from the outset, a conspiracy to assassinate Elizabeth. Anthony Babington was not its chief architect, though it was his letter of 6 July 1586 that floated to Mary the plan for  the dispatch of the usurper . The plot was uncovered   and arguably fomented   using an agent provocateur, intercepts (via the bung-hole of a beer keg) and forgery. Whatever the ethics of the sting, the plot was real. Priests were involved and Mary, executed on 8 February 1587, was complicit. Jesuits prepare to strike   or do they? 1594 Elizabeth s last decade saw court rivalry seep into intelligence work and the result was an occasional   and occasionally deliberate   blurring of perception and reality. Immediately after the Earl of Essex s exposure of a dubious poison plot, the queen s adviser William Cecil went one up with a Jesuit conspiracy involving several Irish soldiers, whose confessions seemed remarkably fortuitous, if somewhat muddled. Two of the assassins-designate were known to Cecil. One he had not deemed a significant threat; the other was an informant and possible plant. When asked the  bloody questions , framed to extract ultimate allegiances, Catholics proved as adept as their queen at the  answer answerless . Spies and agent provocateurs were thrown into the field, moles were placed in embassies and recusant houses were searched for priests and  popish trash . The queen s agents were sometimes overzealous, sometimes downright immoral, in their pursuit of national security.  There is less danger in fearing too much than too little,  advised the queen s spymaster, Francis Walsingham. In 1588, when the Spanish Armada beat menacingly towards the English Channel, the  most obstinate and noted  recusants were rounded up and imprisoned. Sir Thomas Tresham begged for a chance to prove his  true English heart  and fight for his queen. He vigorously disputed the claim that  while we lived, her Majesty should not be in security, nor the realm freed from invasion . Nevertheless, the Spaniards sailing aboard the Rosario were told to expect support from at least a third of England s population. Elizabeth s Privy Council was  certain  that an invasion would  never  have been attempted,  but upon hope  of internal assistance. It may have been a false hope, built on a house of cards by  migr s desperate to see the old faith restored at home, but for as long as it was held, and acted upon, by backers powerful enough to do damage, Tresham and the rest, whether  faithfullest true English subjects  or not, were indeed a security risk. England s victory in 1588 was celebrated as the triumph of Christ over Antichrist, the true church over the false, freedom over tyranny. Elizabeth I was hailed as Gloriana, the Virgin Queen who  brought up, even under her wing, a nation that was almost begotten and born under her, that never shouted any other Ave than for her name . There was no place for rosaries in this predestined, Protestant version of English history. Even Philip II, usually so sure of his status as the special one, was momentarily confounded by the mysteries of God s will. He soon rallied, however, and there were more failed armadas. At every whisper of invasion, the screw was turned on those  bad members  known to be recusants. In 1593, the  statute of confinement  ruled that recusants could not travel beyond five miles of their home without a licence. Observance could be patchy and enforcement slack. Anti-Catholicism was nearly always more passionate in the abstract than it was on the ground, but it still must have been alienating and psychologically draining to be spied on, searched, and branded an  unnatural subject  at every critical juncture. Tresham likened it to being  drenched in a sea of shameless slanders . Tresham outlived Queen Elizabeth by two years. His hope for a measure of toleration under James VI and I did not materialise and, having paid a total of  7,717 in recusancy penalties, he died on 11 September 1605 a disappointed man. The following month, his wife s nephew,  Robin  Catesby, tried to recruit his son, Francis, into the Gunpowder Plot. Francis Tresham was arrested on 12 November and died before he could face trial. On, or soon after 28 November 1605, the family papers were bundled up in a sheet and immured at Rushton Hall. They lay there, undisturbed, for over two centuries, until, in 1828, the builders came in.

        "target_summary": "The reign of Elizabeth I forced English Catholics into a perilous game of hide-and-seek, demanding extraordinary resourcefulness to preserve their outlawed faith. Centuries later, hidden caches uncovered across the country – from a vast bundle of papers at Rushton Hall to a priest-hole at Harvington Hall, and a pedlar's chest of vestments at Samlesbury – offer poignant evidence of their secret struggles. These discoveries underscore the ingenuity required to maintain a spiritual life where Mass was banned, priests were deemed traitors, and even devotional items like rosaries invited suspicion. After 1585, any foreign-ordained priest found in England, along with their lay host, faced the death penalty, necessitating ingenious hiding places and pocket-sized Mass-kits.\n\nWhile an estimated 40,000 Catholics persisted by 1603, they formed a diverse group. Many were \"church papists,\" outwardly conforming to state services while inwardly preserving their beliefs, sometimes even blocking their ears during Protestant sermons. Others, known as \"recusants,\" steadfastly refused official worship, enduring crippling fines that could financially devastate families; Lord Vaux, for example, was reduced to pawning his parliamentary robes.\n\nElizabeth, though disinclined \"to make windows into men's hearts,\" nevertheless expected outward obedience. Her excommunication by Pope Pius V in 1570, declaring her an illegitimate pretender, solidified government distrust of all Catholics and fostered profound anguish and conflicted loyalties among many, including prominent figures like Sir Thomas Tresham.\n\nCatholic hopes were reignited by the arrival of seminary priests from Douai in 1574, followed by dynamic Jesuits like Edmund Campion and Robert Persons. These missionaries bravely crisscrossed England, offering sacraments and spiritual guidance, often proclaiming their mission as \"for souls, not state nor policy.\" Yet, their calls for absolute recusancy challenged the state, leading to brutal torture and the execution of approximately 130 priests and 60 lay supporters for religious treason.\n\nThe queen's vulnerability to assassination, highlighted by the murder of William of Orange, fueled a pervasive paranoia. A series of Catholic plots – including the Ridolfi, Throckmorton, and Babington conspiracies (which led to Mary, Queen of Scots' execution) – were meticulously uncovered by spymasters like Francis Walsingham, often employing morally ambiguous tactics. The Spanish Armada in 1588 further intensified fears, as foreign powers optimistically anticipated widespread Catholic support within England. Despite fervent declarations of loyalty from figures like Sir Thomas Tresham, Catholics remained under intense suspicion, facing continued repression, including the 1593 \"statute of confinement\" that severely restricted their movement.\n\nFor individuals like Tresham, who suffered immense fines and whose family was later tragically entangled in the Gunpowder Plot, the Elizabethan era was a deeply alienating and psychologically draining ordeal. His personal papers, later rediscovered, offer a poignant postscript to a century of covert faith and enduring struggle, a testament to the heavy price paid for holding fast to beliefs deemed treasonous in a kingdom demanding absolute conformity.",

        "content": "A search for the remains of Henry I s  lost  abbey could confirm the whereabouts of the 12th-century king s sarcophagus   and, in parallels with the recent search for Richard III, it s possible that it could be located beneath what is now a car park. Ad The Hidden Abbey Project aims to uncover the full extent of Reading Abbey, which was largely destroyed in 1539 during the dissolution of the monasteries. It has been instigated by Philippa Langley, well known for leading the search for Richard III s remains in Leicester. Langley has secured the support of Historic England   formerly known as English Heritage   and in 2016 the project team will carry out ground-penetrating radar (GPR) research of the abbey area, followed by  trial trenching  to estimate the site s archaeological potential. It is hoped that the imaging might show sarcophagus burials, possibly including that of Henry.  There is believed to be a pristine Cluniac abbey layout buried beneath the ground at Reading,  Langley told BBC History Magazine.  One of the main aims of the project is to confirm the exact positioning of the abbey church, as well as its size and structure. Sarcophagus burials tend to show up very clearly in GPR research, and potentially we might be able to see several.  What s really exciting is that we know that Henry was buried in front of the high altar, with members of his family buried in specific locations around him. The thinking in Reading, using current estimates of the size of the abbey, is that this burial spot is located beneath a school. If the abbey is larger, it could be situated underneath either what is today a playground or a car park. That option is considered less likely, but if Henry s tomb is beneath the car park, that will be very interesting.  Henry founded Reading Abbey in 1121 as a royal mausoleum, and is buried there along with his second wife, Adeliza, and great-grandson William of Poitiers. Langley is eager to stress that, while the potential to find his sarcophagus burial is exciting, the main aim of the project is to find out as much as possible about the abbey itself   and what happens next will be the decision of Historic England. A nearby playground and car park may yield new clues about the location of the king s lost sarcophagus. Credit Philippa Langley She does, however, acknowledge striking similarities between Reading s story and that of Leicester, particularly as there is speculation about the whereabouts of Henry s remains. An unreliable 19th-century story suggests that workmen   likely acting on Edward VI s instructions   targeted the abbey in the 1550s for a silver casket in which the king was supposedly buried, and that his remains were discarded in the process.  The exact location of Richard III s remains was unknown, and here too we have a story of a king s bones possibly being lost,  she says. Much like Richard, Henry was the youngest son who rose to become king. And, as with Richard, Henry s character continues to be hotly disputed: some historians believe he was a cruel and ambitious usurper, while others see him as an enlightened and educated peacemaker. The people of Reading want to tell this extraordinary story, and I want to help to get it out there.  Judith Green, emeritus professor of medieval history at the University of Edinburgh, agrees that the research will be important for the field.  It would be interesting to know how much of Henry s body was actually buried at Reading, because he died in western France after eating lampreys   jawless fish,  she says.  After his death, with the weather too poor to travel to Reading, his body was taken to Rouen where it was embalmed. His intestines, brain and eyes were buried locally and, weeks later, the rest of his body was taken back to Reading. This was the first time the body of an English king had been treated in this way.  A divisive king The youngest of William the Conqueror s four sons, Henry I reigned from 1100 to 1135. He is sometimes considered a usurper, because his elder brother Robert Curthose arguably had a more legitimate claim to the throne, but Henry had himself crowned while Robert was away on crusade. Regarded as playing a key role in stabilising Norman England, Henry increased royal revenues, established peaceful relations with Scotland through his marriage to Mathilda of Scotland, and through his Charter of Liberties   described by some historians as a forerunner of Magna Carta   bound himself to laws concerning the treatment of nobles and church officials. Ad He could, however, also be cruel. He famously cut off the noses of two of his illegitimate granddaughters and blinded them in reprisal for a similar act against a child being held hostage by one of his enemies.",
        "target_summary": "A fascinating new archaeological quest is underway to unearth the long-lost grandeur of Reading Abbey, the formidable 12th-century monarch Henry I's final resting place. Spearheading this ambitious endeavour is Philippa Langley, whose previous triumph in locating Richard III's remains beneath a Leicester car park imbues this search with significant anticipation. Her \"Hidden Abbey Project\" aims to fully reveal the extent of the largely destroyed Cluniac monastery.\n\nWith support from Historic England, the project will employ sophisticated ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and trial trenching. This cutting-edge technology holds the promise of pinpointing the abbey church's exact layout and potentially revealing sarcophagus burials, including that of the king himself. Intriguingly, initial estimations suggest Henry's tomb, thought to be before the high altar, could lie beneath an active school. However, should the abbey prove grander than anticipated, the regal sarcophagus might dramatically emerge from beneath a playground or, with a captivating echo of Richard III's discovery, a modern-day car park.\n\nFounded by Henry I in 1121 as his royal mausoleum, Reading Abbey once housed the king, his second wife Adeliza, and his great-grandson William of Poitiers, before its dissolution in 1539 tragically erased much of its physical presence. Langley herself draws evocative parallels to the hunt for Richard III, noting the enduring mystery surrounding Henry's remains. Unreliable 19th-century accounts hint at Henry's silver casket being plundered and his bones discarded, creating a tantalizing historical puzzle much like that of his Plantagenet successor. Both kings, youngest sons who ascended to the throne, continue to provoke fierce debate among historians regarding their complex legacies.\n\nHistorians also highlight a unique aspect of Henry's interment: dying in France, only his embalmed torso made the journey to Reading. His intestines, brain, and eyes found local burial, marking an unprecedented treatment for an English monarch's body. Ruling from 1100 to 1135, Henry I, the youngest son of William the Conqueror, was a figure of stark contrasts. While sometimes viewed as a usurper, his reign brought stability to Norman England, marked by increased royal revenues and the influential Charter of Liberties. Yet, his rule also bore witness to acts of brutal reprisal, painting the portrait of a king both enlightened and ruthlessly pragmatic. While the prospect of unearthing a royal sarcophagus fuels public imagination, the project's core mission remains a comprehensive understanding of the magnificent abbey itself, promising to unravel centuries of buried history.",

        "title": "Bad King Richard III?  He was a product of his time. I ve warmed to him  says relative Michael Ibsen",
        "content": "In 2004, as she sat down to dinner with her husband in a small town in Ontario, Canada, Michael Ibsen s mother, Joy, received the most curious of phonecalls. At the other end of the line was British historian John Ashdown-Hill, who told her she might be related to Richard III s sister. Ad Joy was informed she had been tracked down as part of a project to identify the possible remains of Margaret of York, sister of Richard III and Edward IV. Ashdown-Hill had traced an all-female line of descent from another sister, Anne of York, to the retired Canadian journalist, and wanted to know if she would consider giving a DNA sample. This was how Joy s son, Michael Ibsen, a cabinet-maker living in Paddington, came to later discover he was a descendant of Richard III. In 2012, following the death of his mother four years earlier, Michael provided a DNA sample to help the University of Leicester team with testing in the event that any remains were found at the Grey Friars church site. If researchers were to find remains, Michael s mitochondrial DNA [which is traced through the maternal line from mother to child, and does not change over time], could help to determine their identity. In Leicester on Wednesday, less than 24 hours before Richard III s reinterment, we spoke to Michael about being related to such a divisive monarch, and found out what it was like to design and make the king s coffin  Q: What has this experience been like for you? A: It s been an interesting journey. Because it s been spread out over such a long period of time [Michael s mother was first contacted in 2004], there have been these bursts of activity in terms of interest from the media. I ve been asked a lot by people outside [Leicester] cathedral this week  how has this changed your life?  It hasn t really changed my life at all, but it s fascinating to be part of history. It s leapt out of the pages of a book   like something out of Indiana Jones, in a way! It s a great privilege to be involved in something like this   it s fascinating. But the intensity of this week has taken me by surprise. On Sunday [when Richard III s coffin was taken from the University of Leicester on an all-day procession, attended by tens of thousands of people], I found myself sat in front of this wall of media, half a metre from a coffin that I had made that contained the remains of Richard III. I just sat there thinking  how on earth did I come to be here? What a strange sequence of events . During the procession, a number of roads were closed so my brother and sister and I just had to get out and walk like everyone else. It was great because no one noticed us. People were following the cortege, moving towards the cathedral, and although my brother and sister and I are not particularly emotional people, we found ourselves caught up in this strange atmosphere of wonder. The whole thing has been such a strange series of coincidences and things coming together, one after another   the science, the archaeology. It s extraordinary. Richard III's coffin in Leicester Cathedral, the day before his reinterment Q: When did you first learn that you were related to Richard III? A: Initially in 2004 my mother didn t tell anyone other than my brother about John Ashdown-Hill s phone call. My brother specialises in privacy issues associated with medical information, so he spent some time looking into it before my mother provided a DNA sample. It wasn t until a few months later, when we were all together as a family, that she announced that she was descended from Anne of York and related to Richard III. Of course, we as offspring, were similarly related. You have to remember that at that point we didn t know anything about the possible excavations to search for Richard III   he was just a figure in the distant past. And we knew that possibly millions of other people might be related to him in the same way. It wasn t until the prospect of the dig became a reality, and the business of the mitochondrial DNA connection being a valid aspect of the story, that our ears pricked up and we became a lot more interested. The Leicester team asked me to be present on the first day of the dig, but I went home afterwards thinking  good luck to them , doubting that they would find anything. I had no idea at the time that they had unearthed Richard already [Richard III s remains were discovered six hours, 33 minutes and 13 seconds in to the dig, at just after 3pm on Saturday 25 August 2012]. They were very good at keeping that quiet! Following the public announcement of the discovery of remains in October 2012, it all went from there. Q: Did you know much about Richard III before all this? A: I knew what probably everyone else knew: that he was a king of England with a bad reputation, largely because of the princes in the Tower. In my twenties I read The Daughter of Time by Josephine Tey [1951], which, of course, is about a modern detective, Alan Grant, trying to solve the mystery of the princes in the Tower. The book stimulated an interest in the period for me, and I went to see for myself the portrait of Richard III that features in it, which is housed at the National Portrait Gallery [in the novel, Grant becomes engrossed in the portrait]. I used to go once a year just to have a look at the painting, for no particular reason. I now think  how odd that for 20 or so years I ve been going to look at this portrait, and then suddenly Richard becomes a presence in my life . Q: What was it like to design and make Richard III s coffin? A: The team asked me more than a year ago whether I would consider doing it. It was all under the radar at first, so I couldn t talk to anyone about it. It was an interesting process   I wanted to first look into the history and find out what Richard s coffin would have looked like, if he had had one. So I got in touch with an expert in burial customs and he very helpfully found out for me that at the time it was highly unusual for people to have had a coffin   certainly a wooden coffin. So it seemed to me that we had more of an open brief historically in terms of what we could do with the coffin. I had at that point already designed something that really looked more like a piece of furniture [than a coffin], so I ripped up the design and came up with something much simpler. I wanted people to be able to identify with it in some basic way. I thought, first of all,  if Richard III had had a coffin it would probably have been made with English oak , which I understand was used for high status funerals. Oak is embedded in the British psyche in some curious way. The inside of the coffin is made with yew, which was used to make longbows and has a sort of mystical sense to it   it s found in churchyards, and was associated with funerals for centuries, I gather. I wanted people to see these materials used very simply but sourced from the best possible woodlands and of the best quality. I was very fortunate because I was in touch with a sawmill that had contacts with the Duchy of Cornwall, so we were able to source the oak from one of the ancient woodlands that belonged to the Duchy of Cornwall in Herefordshire [the Duchy's Harewood End Estate]. This was a wonderful link, because the Duke of Cornwall was also the Prince of Wales, and guess who the Prince of Wales was during Richard s reign? It was Richard s young son [who was given the title before he died as a child, probably of tuberculosis]. Therefore, Richard s son, as the Duke of Cornwall, would have inherited the Duchy of Cornwall estates when he came of age. So you have this wonderful connection   Richard being buried in timber sourced from the Duchy of Cornwall woodlands. It honours Richard, I hope. Richard III s coffin was taken from the University of Leicester on an all-day procession on Sunday. (DARREN STAPLES/WPA Rota/Press Association Images) Q: You earlier described Richard as a king with  a bad reputation . Does it bother you that you are related to such a controversial king? A: Obviously it would be nice to be related to a more benign monarch, as it were! But I sometimes say to people  who would you rather be related to: Henry VIII or Richard III?  I mean, Henry VIII didn t exactly have a great reputation either! But I think one of the great things about this whole episode is that it s forcing people to rethink what s been written about Richard III, and about his reign and his life. My own reading is that Richard was very much a product of his time. How do you look at medieval life through 21st-century eyes? What we would find utterly unacceptable was probably just part of everyday life for many people back then. And vice versa   medieval people looking at our society would certainly have questions: what place does the church have in people s lives now compared to back then, for example? Over the past year-and-a-half I ve warmed to Richard III in a way I perhaps hadn t before. Q: How do you feel about seeing this experience come to an end, now that Richard III is being reinterred? A: Everything will quieten down and I ll go back to my day-to-day life, which is fine, but I ll have the memory of it. I ll still be able to pop up to Leicester to see the many friends that I ve made at the university, the council, and the cathedral. And above all I like to think I can come and sit in a corner of the cathedral and look at the tomb and think  there, under the floor, is the coffin I made containing Richard III .

On the line was a British historian, informing her of a potential direct lineage to Anne of York, sister to the infamous Richard III. This extraordinary revelation was part of a larger quest to identify medieval royal remains, prompting Joy to provide a DNA sample. This unexpected family history soon extended to her son, cabinet-maker Michael Ibsen, who, following his mother's passing in 2008, would provide his own mitochondrial DNA – a crucial genetic marker passed unchanged through the maternal line – to the University of Leicester team searching for Richard III’s lost burial site.\n\nThe ensuing years unfolded as an \"interesting journey\" for Michael, punctuated by \"bursts of activity\" as the historical saga gained momentum. He describes the experience as \"leaping out of the pages of a book\" – an \"Indiana Jones\"-esque adventure that he considers a profound privilege. The intensity of the reinterment week, however, caught him by surprise. Sitting just meters from the coffin he meticulously crafted, containing the very king he was descended from, he found himself pondering the \"strange sequence of events\" that led him there. During the solemn procession, amidst a throng of onlookers, Michael and his siblings walked unnoticed, swept up in a \"strange atmosphere of wonder\" as archaeology and science converged in an \"extraordinary\" series of coincidences.\n\nMichael learned of his direct royal lineage when his mother shared the news with the family, initially a distant historical curiosity. His interest deepened dramatically when the Leicester dig became a reality, and the scientific importance of his mitochondrial DNA became clear. Though present on the first day of the excavation, he left doubting success, unaware that Richard III's remains had been unearthed just hours later, a secret expertly maintained until the public announcement months later. Prior to this, Michael's knowledge of Richard III was limited to the common narrative of a king with a \"bad reputation\" due to the Princes in the Tower. Intriguingly, for two decades, he had annually visited Richard III's portrait in London, a curious premonition of the king's impending presence in his life.\n\nA year before the reinterment, Michael was secretly tasked with designing Richard III's coffin. His research into medieval burial customs revealed that wooden coffins were highly unusual for the era, granting him creative freedom. He aimed for a design that resonated simply yet profoundly, ultimately crafting it from English oak – a wood associated with high-status funerals and deeply rooted in the British psyche. He sourced this oak from the ancient Duchy of Cornwall woodlands, forging a poignant link, as the Duchy's estates would have been inherited by Richard's young son, the Prince of Wales, had he lived. The coffin's interior was lined with yew, a wood steeped in mystical associations, often found in churchyards and historically linked to funerals. This careful selection, Michael hopes, \"honours Richard\" with both material and symbolism.\n\nWhile acknowledging the allure of a \"more benign monarch,\" Michael sees being related to the controversial Richard III as an opportunity to challenge centuries of historical narrative. He advocates for viewing Richard as a \"product of his time,\" arguing against judging medieval life through a 21st-century lens. Over the intense period of his involvement, he confesses to having \"warmed to Richard III\" in a way he hadn't before. As the momentous reinterment concludes, Michael anticipates a return to his ordinary life, yet cherishes the enduring memory. He envisions a future where he can quietly visit Leicester Cathedral, gaze upon the tomb, and reflect on the coffin he made, containing the remains of his royal ancestor – a silent testament to an extraordinary personal connection to history.",

        "content": "The discovery of Richard III s remains beneath a Leicester car park in 2012 is one of the biggest historical stories of the past decade. Carried out by the Looking for Richard Project and archaeologists from the University of Leicester, the dig and subsequent research sparked debate about what new details the bones could reveal about the man, his life and legacy   and whether these bones were even the king s. Here, historians and experts share their views on the implications of the investigation, and why laying the body to rest may not be the end of the saga. Ad Dan Jones:  This discovery shows what 21st-century science has to offer historians  The wealth of information harvested from Richard s bones and grave is amazing, and shows just how much 21st- century science has to offer historians. I don t just mean the DNA work that identified the remains as the king s. Careful analysis of the skeleton diagnosed Richard s spinal deformity as idiopathic scoliosis, and told us much about the wounds he suffered at the battle of Bosworth in 1485. We learned that the king probably had blue eyes, and was a blond-haired child. Soil analysis told us he had roundworm in his gut. Dental examination suggests he ground his teeth. Isotope analysis of his ribs revealed that his diet got richer in later life. It s a great interdisciplinary case study   and it offers a tantalising glimpse of what we could learn if we opened other monarchs  tombs. The 18th- and 19th-century vogue for peering into ancient royal graves is long gone. Yet how much more we could find out today! Paradoxically, at a time when we could know so much about the dead, we have grown incredibly prissy about disturbing them. Shame. Dan Jones is the author of The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses and the Rise of the Tudors (Faber and Faber, 2014) Philippa Langley:  We were able to disprove myths that had become truths  The Looking For Richard Project began where the study of our past always begins: with open minds and questions. Everyone in Leicester told us that the king s body had been dug up and thrown into the river Soar; we proved that the age-old story was false, dreamed up to suit a reputation that people had been led to believe. We questioned that reputation, too, by commissioning a psychological analysis of the king by two leading academics, Mark Lansdale and Julian Boon, which is available to read online. By questioning, we were able to uncover the real Richard and disprove many of the myths that surrounded him   myths that had, over time, become  truths . Our years of work brought extraordinary results, demonstrating what can be achieved when preconceptions are set aside. This year we commemorate finding Richard III; who knows what still waits to be discovered? It s my prediction that the study of late medieval England will never be the same again. Philippa Langley led the search for Richard III through the Looking For Richard Project, and co-authored The King s Grave: The Search for Richard III (2013), and Finding Richard III: The Official Account (2014) Mike Pitts:  A distant medieval monarch has been revealed as one of us  There was great excitement when archaeologists announced that a king s remains had been found in Leicester. Many experts, however, were sceptical: what new would we learn? The historian and broadcaster Mary Beard, for instance, wondered on Twitter whether the discovery had  any HISTORICAL significance?  To counter such doubts, we might note the positive, practical outcomes. The Richard III Society, Channel 4, the University of Leicester and the city of Leicester itself, to name but a few of those closely involved, have all benefited. The university, for example, estimated that immediate press coverage was worth  2m to it. Such things matter. But we have, in fact, also gained new insights into Richard III and contemporary historical documents. And I think that we have understood something greater still. The tawdry details of Richard s grave, and the immediacy of bones, wounds and dirt, have touched people in ways beyond the reach of history or Shakespeare. Archaeology has made a historical cypher real, and humanised a fictional monster. A distant medieval monarch has been revealed as one of us. Mike Pitts is the author of Digging for Richard III: How Archaeology Found the King (Thames and Hudson, 2014) Michael Hicks:  This quest funded a massive research effort. Yet it failed  This quest generated worldwide knowledge of Richard III, of modern science and of Leicester University, funded a massive multi-disciplinary research effort and potentially taught much about Richard and his age. Yet it failed   perhaps because these bones were not Richard s*, but those of a non-Plantagenet slain between 1455 and 1530; certainly because the issue was prejudged. Researchers sought only to confirm the remains as Richard s. Suspect radiocarbon dating, discrepancies in the evidence found in the wounds and grave, and contrary Y chromosome results   all of these were brushed aside. Much remains unknown   about Richard s maternal ancestors; mortality in the Wars of the Roses; where that conflict s slain were buried; the identities of the other internees at the Leicester friary; and paternity breaks among late medieval English aristocrats. This cannot be the end of the research. * Michael Hicks queried the identification of the remains in the April 2014 issue of BBC History Magazine Michael Hicks is the former head of history at the University of Winchester Phil Stone:  Richard III will be buried with dignity and honour  After Bosworth, Richard III was taken to Leicester, exposed and then buried in the Grey Friars with much haste and little honour. It is not known where he wished to be buried   his will has not survived   but there has been much (and sometimes very passionate) debate about where his remains should go. Standard archaeological practice is to rebury remains close to where they were found, reflected in the exhumation licence upheld in the High Court. Richard III will be buried in Leicester Cathedral, very close to the Grey Friars. All of the suggested alternatives had their drawbacks. The family mausoleum at Fotheringhay is too small, and it is my understanding that the authorities would not give permission to use St George s Chapel, Windsor or Westminster Abbey. Besides, there is no room in the latter for another burial, especially that of a king. York Minster was also suggested, since Richard III had ordered the building of a chantry there   yet that does not mean that he intended it to be the location of his burial (and, in any case, burials in the minster were halted by law some 170 years ago). Despite demands to do otherwise, the Richard III Society has maintained impartiality throughout the entirety of the burial debate. Our stance was that we would work with whichever religious house was chosen in order to ensure that Richard III could be buried with dignity, solemnity and honour, giving him what he was denied in 1485. I m very pleased to say that this is what is to be done. Phil Stone is chairman of the Richard III Society Francis Pryor:  The project was a great achievement for archaeology  The archaeological excavation and the historical reconstruction were enormously successful. They provided splendid examples of close teamwork and showed why archaeology is still the best general training for life after university that any student could hope to acquire. The Richard III project combined so many useful skills: hands-on practical experience, advanced computing and surveying, but also  softer  aspects such as interpretation, communication, PR and outreach. The project showed well how modern archaeology can bridge the divide between the worlds of art and science better than any other academic subject. All in all, it was a huge achievement and a great  for the expert research being carried out by institutions such as the University of Leicester. Francis Pryor is the author of Home: A Time Traveller s Tales from Britain s Prehistory (Allen Lane, 2014) Dr Turi King:  We will be able to learn even more in coming years  he identification of Richard III s remains was based on strands of evidence drawn from experts from the fields of history, archaeology, osteology, forensics, engineering, medicine, genealogy and genetics. The genetic analysis has thrown up some particularly interesting results, showing that there isn t a match with living male-line relatives. This is not particularly surprising given the known possibility of a false paternity (in other words, the biological father is not the recorded father) somewhere in the 19 links in the genealogical chain   though where the break occurred is still not known. We now know that Richard almost certainly had blue eyes and probably light-coloured hair, at least in childhood, allowing us to show which of the two earliest portraits of Richard most closely matches the genetically predicted results (the  arched-frame portrait  in the Society of Antiquaries of London). As we continue to learn more about which gene or genes may be involved in particular traits, the current whole-genome analysis will allow us to use this knowledge to learn even more about Richard in the coming years. Dr Turi King is lecturer in genetics and archaeology at the University of Leicester Chris Skidmore:  This evidence needs to be the beginning, not the final word  I will never forget the moment when I found out that Richard s remains had been unearthed beneath a Leicester car park. Sitting at my desk in the sweltering August heat back in 2012, I had nearly finished the first draft of my book on Bosworth when, with BBC News playing in the background, I caught a sight of the red  breaking news  banner flashing across the screen. Since then, there seems to have been barely a day when Richard III has been out of the news. The discovery has revealed much about the final wounds sustained by Richard during his final moments on the battlefield, in what seems nothing less than a staged execution rather than death by fighting. Scientific tests on the remains have taught us more about Richard: perhaps most importantly, we now know that Thomas More was right, and that Richard did have a curved spine, though hardly of  hunchback  proportions. Yet all of this new evidence needs to be the start, not the last word, in a reassessment of Richard s life. And to do this, the evidence will no longer be found in the ground but in the countless pages of undisturbed documentary evidence lying under our noses in the archives. Richard is finally to be laid to rest   yet the search for new evidence must continue. I m confident that the controversies surrounding one of England s most famous monarchs will remain alive for years to come.

        "target_summary": "The remarkable discovery of King Richard III's remains beneath a Leicester car park in 2012 ignited a global historical sensation, prompting profound debates about the monarch's life, legacy, and the very identity of the bones unearthed. This monumental finding spurred an interdisciplinary investigation that has not only unveiled startling new insights into the last Plantagenet king but also reshaped the landscape of historical research.\n\nDan Jones eloquently champions the power of 21st-century science in illuminating the past. From meticulous DNA analysis confirming the remains' identity to detailed osteological examinations revealing Richard's idiopathic scoliosis and the nature of his fatal battle wounds, the bones yielded an astonishing wealth of information. Beyond identifying his blue eyes and blond hair, soil analysis unveiled evidence of roundworm, dental studies hinted at teeth grinding, and isotope analysis charted his evolving diet. Jones hails this as an unparalleled interdisciplinary triumph, lamenting the historical reluctance to apply such rigorous scientific scrutiny to other royal tombs.\n\nPhilippa Langley, whose \"Looking for Richard Project\" spearheaded the search, emphasizes the project's foundation in open-minded inquiry, challenging long-held myths that had calcified into accepted \"truths.\" Her team successfully disproved the age-old tale of Richard's body being cast into the River Soar and actively questioned his historical reputation, even commissioning psychological analyses. By setting aside preconceptions, Langley asserts, the project brought to light the \"real Richard,\" irrevocably altering the study of late medieval England.\n\nMike Pitts acknowledges initial skepticism regarding the historical significance of the discovery but highlights its tangible benefits, including substantial publicity for the University of Leicester. More profoundly, Pitts suggests the raw, visceral details of the grave—the bones, the wounds, the soil—transcended academic discourse, forging a unique connection with the public. Archaeology, he argues, masterfully transformed a \"historical cipher\" and \"fictional monster\" into a relatable human figure, revealing a \"distant medieval monarch\" as \"one of us.\"\n\nHowever, Michael Hicks offers a dissenting voice, suggesting the quest, despite its global impact, ultimately \"failed.\" He contends that the identification was prejudged, citing \"suspect\" radiocarbon dating, discrepancies in wound and grave evidence, and conflicting Y-chromosome results that were allegedly overlooked. Hicks stresses that crucial unknowns persist—regarding Richard's maternal ancestors, mortality during the Wars of the Roses, and the identities of other friary burials—demanding that research continue, free from predetermined conclusions.\n\nAmidst these revelations and debates, Phil Stone addresses the passionate arguments surrounding Richard's final resting place. He confirms the decision to rebury the king with \"dignity and honour\" in Leicester Cathedral, in close proximity to his original, hurried grave. This move, aligning with archaeological best practices and upholding the High Court's exhumation license, ensures Richard receives the solemn respect denied to him in 1485, despite various impractical alternatives proposed.\n\nFrancis Pryor hails the project as a monumental achievement for archaeology, showcasing exemplary teamwork and the integration of diverse skills—from practical fieldwork and advanced computing to crucial \"softer\" aspects like interpretation and public outreach. He champions the project as a testament to modern archaeology's unique ability to bridge the divide between the arts and sciences, celebrating the expert research capabilities of institutions like the University of Leicester.\n\nDr. Turi King elaborates on the meticulous, interdisciplinary process of identification, particularly highlighting the genetic analysis. She notes the intriguing finding of a non-match in living male-line relatives, explaining this as a possible \"false paternity event\" somewhere within the 19-link genealogical chain. Genetic insights further confirmed Richard's almost certain blue eyes and probable light hair, aiding in the authentication of his historical portraits. King emphasizes that ongoing whole-genome analysis promises even deeper, unprecedented insights into Richard III in the years to come.\n\nFinally, Chris Skidmore reflects on the discovery's enduring media presence and its profound impact. Scientific tests provided crucial details about Richard's fatal wounds, hinting at a \"staged execution\" rather than a mere battlefield death, and confirmed his curved spine, validating early accounts like Thomas More's. Skidmore asserts that this new evidence must serve as a *beginning*, not an endpoint, for a comprehensive reassessment of Richard's life, urging continued exploration of the \"countless pages of undisturbed documentary evidence\" in archives. As Richard III is finally laid to rest, the controversies surrounding this enigmatic monarch, Skidmore predicts, will undoubtedly continue to captivate for generations.",

        "title": "Five places Richard III may have wanted to be buried (and none of them are Leicester)",
        "content": "Speaking exclusively to History Extra, Hicks said that at one time or another, the last Plantagenet king envisaged being buried at at least five different locations. Ad Hicks, who is head of history at the University of Winchester, said:  Death was ever-present in the Middle Ages, and people prepared for it at much younger ages than they do today.  Determining what happened to their possessions was a factor, but it was more important to ensure salvation and to mitigate sufferings in purgatory after death.  Richard III died at the age of 32. He drafted wills   none of which now survive   and planned his death on several occasions. Each will would have succeeded the previous one.  Richard died a traitor, with all his possessions seized by the crown. He died intestate [as though without making a formal will]; therefore we do not know for sure where he wanted to be buried. But I believe there are a number of possible places.  The result of a judicial review over where the remains of Richard III should be buried is expected this month. The judicial review will examine the justice secretary s decision to authorise the exhumation and reinterment of the monarch s remains in Leicester. It has been brought by a group of Richard III s distant relatives, the Plantagenet Alliance Limited, who are campaigning to see the former king reburied in York. Here, Hicks explores five sites Richard may have wished to have been buried: Fotheringhay College Where? The mausoleum of the House of York, Northamptonshire Why? Richard was born at Fotheringhay, and I think the presumption must have once been that he would be buried at the family mausoleum at Fotheringhay College. It was founded by the Dukes of York, and contains memorials to many of the members of the House of York. There, in 1476, Richard presided as chief mourner at the reburial of his father, Richard Duke of York, and elder brother, Edmund Earl of Rutland, both slain by the Lancastrians in 1460 at the battle of Wakefield. [They were previously buried at Pontefract]. I think, until he had his own family and mausoleum, Fotheringhay was the most likely place Richard would have been buried. Richard also helped to endow St George s Chapel Windsor, which his eldest brother Edward IV planned to be his own mausoleum. Edward was indeed buried there. He allotted space within it to at least two trusted Yorkists, Lords Hastings and Ferrers: perhaps Richard planned to join them As king, Richard moved Henry VI there from Chertsey. Perhaps he expected to make this the new royal mausoleum. However, he later became dynastic, marrying Anne Neville and having at least one child, and his burial place of choice probably changed. It s also worth noting that the other three family burial places of Richard and his wife, Anne Neville, available to him   Warwick College, Tewkesbury Abbey and Bisham Priory   were located too far away from where Richard lived to be viable options. They did not fit in with his role as  lord of the north . Middleham parish church and Barnard Castle chapel Where? North Yorkshire and County Durham respectively Why? In 1478, Richard decided to found two collegiate churches of dean, canons and choristers, in the north: at Middleham parish church and the chapel in Barnard Castle. It was logical for Richard to establish his own mausoleum. Therefore, he gained permission in 1478 to start endowing these churches. Richard gave Middleham parish church substantial estates, and aimed to found and incorporate a college there for a dean and six secular priests. He assembled some building materials to extend the east end and add living accommodation, but had not got very far when he died. St Alkelda s Church at Middleham survives. Perhaps he meant Middleham to become the burial place for his family, but more probably he had such plans for the chapel in Barnard Castle   its foundation was to be much bigger and grander, for a dean and twelve priests. Nothing of it now remains. However, when Richard became king, both Middleham and Barnard were rendered out of date   neither were grand enough for a king. York Minster Where? York, North Yorkshire Why? As Duke of Gloucester, Richard made himself  Lord of the North . When Richard became king in 1483, he celebrated especially at York, where his son was invested as Prince of Wales. Richard founded a chantry at York Minster of 100 priests, to pray for the good of his soul and those of his family. One hundred priests was an unheard of quantity   the wages would have been about  1,000 a year, and the plan required a  25,000 capital investment. This was an enormous investment: about a third of the income of the English crown at the time. This was a bigger endowment than for any other medieval chapel. We know that some clergy were appointed and paid, and celebrated mass at existing chapels in the minster. Materials were assembled to extend the minster, and to establish living accommodation, but we know nothing of the plans that were dropped after Richard s death. Professor Barrie Dobson suggested that York Minster was to be Richard s sepulchre. This is unproven but, given the evidence, perfectly feasible. Westminster Abbey Where? Westminster, London Why? Richard s wife, Anne Neville, died at Westminster in March 1485, and was buried with all the honours due to a queen at Westminster Abbey by the door to Edward the Confessor s chapel. It could have been that Richard planned to join her there   it was common to be buried with your wife. But only four months later   in August 1485   Richard himself was dead. He therefore had no time to construct a splendid tomb for Anne, and perhaps for himself too. The problem with Westminster Abbey, however, was that there was little space   this was why Henry VII added his massive Lady Chapel at the east end. And while we might argue that Richard wanted to be buried at Westminster with his queen, there is some evidence that he tried to replace her before she died. And why might Richard not have wanted to be buried at Leicester? Leicester is home to the mausoleum of the House of Lancaster   Richard s enemy   so it s very unlikely he would have wanted to be buried there. But history happened, and he was killed in battle in Leicester. People who died in battle didn t have any say in where they ended up [being buried]. Prof Hicks last month raised doubts about whether the skeleton discovered in Leicester is in fact that of Richard III. Click here to read the article.

        "target_summary": "Historian Hicks unveils that Richard III, like many in the ever-present shadow of medieval death, meticulously considered at least five different final resting places throughout his tumultuous life. In an era where preparations for salvation often began young, Richard drafted multiple wills – none of which now survive – leaving his true intentions for a final resting place a poignant mystery after he died intestate and as a declared traitor. This historical ambiguity fuels a modern judicial review concerning the rightful reinterment of his remains, contested between Leicester, where he was found, and York, championed by his distant Plantagenet relatives.\n\nAn early and deeply personal choice for Richard was Fotheringhay College in Northamptonshire, his birthplace and the established family mausoleum of the Dukes of York. Here, he had presided as chief mourner at the reburial of his father and brother, making it a powerful contender until his own family and dynastic aspirations began to evolve. While he also contributed to St George's Chapel, Windsor – his elder brother Edward IV's chosen site and a potential royal mausoleum – other family burial places were simply too distant from his evolving northern power base to be practical.\n\nAs Duke of Gloucester, Richard then dedicated himself to his northern heartland, planning to establish grand collegiate churches at Middleham and Barnard Castle in 1478. He explicitly envisioned these as his personal mausoleums, particularly the more ambitious Barnard Castle site, even assembling building materials and securing permission for their substantial endowment. However, upon ascending to the throne, Hicks notes that neither location was deemed suitably magnificent or regal for a king's ultimate repose.\n\nYork Minster emerges as a highly plausible regal sepulchre, especially after Richard became king and firmly established his identity as the \"Lord of the North.\" He grandly celebrated his ascension there, invested his son as Prince of Wales, and initiated an unprecedented, monumental endowment: a chantry of 100 priests to pray for his soul, requiring immense financial and material investment equivalent to about a third of the English crown's income. Though his premature death abruptly halted these ambitious plans, the sheer scale of his commitment strongly suggests York Minster was intended as his magnificent, royal resting place.\n\nWestminster Abbey became a sudden, albeit brief, potential site when Richard's wife, Anne Neville, was buried there as queen in March 1485. While it was customary for a husband to join his wife in death, Richard's own demise just four months later left no time for such arrangements or the construction of a splendid tomb. Furthermore, the Abbey already faced severe space constraints, and some historians point to evidence suggesting Richard's intentions regarding his marriage were complex, making his desire to be buried specifically with Anne less certain.\n\nUltimately, Leicester, the actual resting place of Richard III, was an entirely improbable choice for the king himself, serving as the historical mausoleum of his Lancastrian enemies. His ignominious interment there was simply a harsh consequence of dying in battle, granting him no agency over his post-mortem fate.",

        "title": "Lambert Simnel: Richard III s heir who 'had a stronger claim to the throne than Henry VII'",
        "content": "Claiming to be Richard III s heir and the rightful king of England, this boy   supposedly Edward, Earl of Warwick, the son of Richard III s brother, George, Duke of Clarence   was crowned king of England in Dublin Cathedral, despite the Tudor government insisting that his real name was Lambert Simnel and that he was an imposter. Ad In 2015, the late author and historian John Ashdown-Hill questioned the generally accepted Tudor view that this boy was a mere pretender to the throne. In The Dublin King, Ashdown-Hill used previously unpublished information to uncover the true identity of the Yorkist heir, who he concludes had a stronger claim to the throne than Henry VII. He also debunked the belief by some that the so-called  Dublin King  himself claimed to be one of the  princes in the Tower . Here, Ashdown-Hill revealed the two conflicting life stories of Edward, 17th Earl of Warwick  Born: 25 February 1475, Warwick Castle Died: Officially beheaded for treason, Tower Hill, 28 November 1499   but his conflicting life story disputes this Family: The third of four children of George, Duke of Clarence and his wife, Isabel Neville. Edward s maternal grandfather was the famous  Kingmaker  Earl of Warwick. His father s brothers were the Yorkist kings, Edward IV and Richard III. Edward s eldest sibling, Anne, and his younger brother, Richard, both died soon after being born. His mother, Isabel Duchess of Clarence, also died soon after Richard s birth Famous for: Reputedly spending his teenage years as Henry VII s prisoner in the Tower of London, and suffering from a mental disability Life: Edward s father, George, believed his enemy Elizabeth Woodville (consort of his brother, Edward IV) was behind the poisoning of his wife and younger son. He became scared about the future of his surviving children   and himself. Fear for his children led to plans to smuggle Edward out of the country - and to contacts with Ireland. Fear for his own future prompted George s campaign against Elizabeth Woodville and her children. This resulted in George s imprisonment and execution. Thus, as his third birthday approached, Edward Earl of Warwick found himself orphaned. His uncle, Edward IV, sent for him. But King Edward IV had not seen his nephew and namesake for three years. Could the king have recognised the little boy who was handed over to him and then brought up as Earl of Warwick at the Tower of London? In 1483, following the death of Edward IV, Richard III was offered the crown on the grounds that Edward IV had been legally married to Eleanor Talbot, daughter of Lord Shrewsbury. Thus Edward IV s subsequent marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was bigamous and their children were illegitimate. Richard III assumed care of young Warwick (then aged eight). He housed him at Sheriff Hutton Castle near York, with other Yorkist princes and princesses, and began training Warwick for a future position of power and influence. In 1485 Richard III was killed at the battle of Bosworth. The usurper Henry VII had no real claim to the throne. To improve his weak position Henry decided to marry Elizabeth of York (eldest daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville). He revoked the act of Parliament which stated that Edward IV s real wife had been Eleanor Talbot, and then represented Elizabeth to the nation as the Yorkist heiress. But Henry VII was worried about Warwick. In 1470 King Henry VI had recognised George Duke of Clarence as the next Lancastrian heir to the throne after his own son. As Henry VI and his son had died in 1471, and George had died in 1478, by 1485 Warwick was the legitimate Lancastrian heir   a claim arguably unaffected by his father s execution at the hands of a Yorkist king. So Henry VII took charge of Warwick. First he was placed under the guardianship of Henry VII s own mother, and later he was consigned to the Tower of London. But curiously, at the same time an alternative  son of Clarence  was being entertained in Mechelen, at the palace of his putative aunt, Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy: Margaret s Edward Earl of Warwick had apparently been brought up in Ireland. Had George s plot to smuggle his son and heir abroad in 1476 therefore succeeded? Henry VII s prisoner, or Margaret of York s guest   which of the two Earls of Warwick was genuine? Margaret s  Warwick  returned to Ireland with an army and key Yorkist supporters, led by Warwick s cousin, the Earl of Lincoln. In Ireland they combined forces with the great Earl of Kildare   former friend and deputy of Warwick s father. On 24 May 1487, Margaret s  Warwick  was crowned  Edward VI, King of England  at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin. Henry VII s anxious government sent servants to inspect the new king. They hoped to prove the boy a fraud, but when the servants met  Edward VI  they were confused. Later, Henry VII s government announced that the boy crowned in Dublin was an impostor, named either  John [BLANK]  or  Lambert Simnel . But the government s accounts of the  pretender  were also confused. Fortunately for Henry VII, when  Edward VI  invaded England, he was defeated at the battle of Stoke   and possibly captured   although one account says he escaped! The young prisoner became a servant in Henry VII s kitchen under the name of  Lambert Simnel . Meanwhile, the official Earl of Warwick remained in the Tower. In 1499 he was condemned to death, to clear the path for the projected marriage of Henry VII s son, Arthur, Prince of Wales, to the Spanish princess, Catherine of Aragon. His body was buried at Bisham Priory. So which is the true story of Edward Earl of Warwick? If the remains of the young man executed by Henry VII in 1499 could be rediscovered on the site of Bisham Priory, DNA research (similar to my 2004 discovery which prompted the search for, and subsequent identification of, the remains of Richard III) could potentially be used to clarify the truth. The late John Ashdown-Hill was a freelance historian with a PhD in history. His book, The Dublin King: The True Story of Edward Earl of Warwick, Lambert Simnel and the 'Princes in the Tower' is published by The History Press.

        "target_summary": "The traditional tale of Lambert Simnel, widely dismissed as an imposter crowned \"Edward VI\" in Dublin while the true Edward, Earl of Warwick, remained imprisoned by Henry VII, faces a compelling challenge from historian John Ashdown-Hill. In his book, *The Dublin King*, Ashdown-Hill delves into previously unexamined information, proposing that the boy known as Lambert Simnel may have been the genuine Yorkist heir, possessing a more legitimate claim to the throne than Henry VII himself.\n\nAshdown-Hill illuminates two strikingly divergent life stories for Edward, Earl of Warwick, nephew to Kings Edward IV and Richard III. The official Tudor account depicts Warwick, born in 1475, as orphaned young and eventually imprisoned in the Tower of London by Henry VII. This individual, often portrayed as mentally disabled, was controversially executed for treason in 1499, ostensibly to secure the marriage of Prince Arthur to Catherine of Aragon.\n\nHowever, an alternative and more intricate narrative suggests a different fate. Fearing for his children's safety, Warwick's father, George, Duke of Clarence, may have orchestrated his son's smuggling out of England around 1476. This \"alternative\" Edward, seemingly raised in Ireland, became a symbol of Yorkist hopes. Supported by his powerful aunt, Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy, and other key figures, he returned to Ireland with an army. On May 24, 1487, he was grandly crowned \"Edward VI, King of England\" in Dublin Cathedral. Henry VII's government, initially perplexed by the boy's identity, ultimately branded him an impostor, dubbing him \"Lambert Simnel.\" Following his defeat at the Battle of Stoke, this \"Simnel\" was reputedly captured and relegated to a life as a servant in the royal kitchens.\n\nAshdown-Hill posits that the true Earl of Warwick was the \"Dublin King\" who survived and escaped, while the individual executed in the Tower was, in fact, a substitute. This intriguing historical enigma leaves a profound question lingering: which of these two accounts truly reveals the fate of Edward, Earl of Warwick?

        "title": "Mary I: a highly impressive queen cut off in her prime",
        "content": "Bloody Mary was a Catholic bigot, a half-Spanish tyrant who burned nearly 300 Protestant men, women and children in one of the most ferocious periods of persecution in Reformation Europe. At least that s how subsequent (Protestant) writers painted her. John Foxe s classic martyrology, Actes and Monuments (popularly known as the Book of Martyrs), first published in 1563, graphically depicted  the horrible and bloudy time of Queene Mary  and dominated accounts of Mary s reign for nearly 500 years. Ad In his First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, written on the eve of Mary s death, John Knox condemned Mary both as a woman ruler and a Catholic: she was a  horrible monster Jezebel  who  compelled [Englishmen] to bow their necks under the yoke of Satan . Traditionally viewed through the prism of her religion, Mary s five-year reign has been described as disastrous, unimaginative and ineffective, with no positive achievements. Yet Mary Tudor was England s first acknowledged queen regnant: the first woman to wear the crown of England. It was a situation that her father, Henry VIII, had gone to great and infamous lengths to avert. But Mary more than met the challenge. In unprecedented circumstances she proved courageous and politically accomplished. Her reign redefined the contours of the English monarchy and proved that queens could rule as kings. For much of her life Mary had struggled to defend her right to the throne   and even to preserve her life. After the breakdown of the marriage between her mother, Catherine of Aragon, and Henry VIII she was demoted from royal princess to bastard. She was, for a time, written out of the succession by her father and, though reinstated by the 1544 Third Act of Succession and by Henry s will, she remained illegitimate. When her nine-year-old brother Edward VI inherited the throne in 1547 and confronted Mary s Catholicism, she declared that she would rather  lay her head on a block  than forsake her faith. Her supporters urged her to flee abroad, but Mary remained in England, determined to defend her claim to the crown. Battle for the crown Following her brother s death in July 1553, Mary   against all odds   won the throne in an extraordinary coup d tat. Edward had written Mary out of the succession and instead named the Protestant Lady Jane Grey as heir to the throne. Before the king s death was made public, John Dudley, the Duke of Northumberland, had secured control of the Tower and had the royal artillery and coffers at his disposal. With London apparently secure, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen. When Mary received a tip-off that Edward s death was imminent and Northumberland planned to capture her, she fled across East Anglia. One of her supporters described this as an act of  Herculean rather than of womanly daring . At Framlingham Castle in Suffolk, Mary raised her standard and rallied the local gentry and commons to her cause. On 19 July she was proclaimed queen, and her accession was greeted joyously. The scale of her achievement is often overlooked. Mary had led the only successful revolt against central government in 16th-century England. She had eluded capture, mobilised a counter-coup and, in the moment of crisis, proved courageous, decisive and politically adept. By playing down her Catholicism and proclaiming her legitimacy, Mary secured both Catholic and Protestant support. She also ensured that the crown continued along the legal line of Tudor succession, in doing so, defending Elizabeth s position as her heir (though this wasn t made official until the final weeks of her life). Having secured the throne, Mary then had to establish herself as a female monarch. It was an unprecedented position in a deeply patriarchal society   indeed, many questioned whether a woman could wear the crown. The monarch was understood to be God s representative on Earth, a figure of defence and justice   a role premised on military might. The language, image and expectations of English monarchy and royal majesty were unequivocally male, and the rights of a queen regnant were a matter of great uncertainty. Mary s accession had changed the rules of the game, and the nature of this new feminised politics was yet to be defined, yet in many respects Mary proved more than equal to the task. Decisions over the details of the practice and power of a queen regnant became precedents for the future. In April 1554 Mary s parliament passed the Act for Regal Power, which enshrined in law that queens held power as  fully, wholly and absolutely  as their male predecessors, thereby establishing the gender-free authority of the crown. Mary s coronation saw her accepting the full regalia of a male monarch and assuming the sacral role that had hitherto been confined to kings. Previously, it had been precisely the exercise of this semi-priestly power, derived from the coronation, that   it was argued   precluded women from acceding to the throne. By continuing practices undertaken by previous kings   providing the healing touch for the  king s evil  (scrofula) and blessing rings believed to cure cramp and epilepsy   Mary showed that the office of crowned monarch was not limited by gender. Mary had stated a preference for remaining single but accepted the need to marry to fulfil her public duty to her faith and her kingdom. Everyone agreed on the need for a husband who could guide her in ruling, and produce a male heir, thereby securing the succession. Though it has traditionally been argued that Mary s marriage to Philip of Spain was unpopular, an alliance with Habsburg Spain was politically expedient. Certainly, the marriage treaty was as  favourable as possible for the interest and security and even the grandeur of England , with Mary s legal rights as queen preserved and Spanish influence kept to a minimum For some, though, this was not enough. In January 1554 Mary faced a Protestant rebellion led by Thomas Wyatt that aimed to prevent the match, but once again the queen rose to the occasion. Despite the urging of her councillors she refused to leave London; then, in a remarkable speech at the Guildhall, she attacked Wyatt as a wicked traitor, defended her religion and choice of husband, and called on Londoners to stand firm in support. Mary stressed her defiance, courage and commitment not by claiming to have the qualities of a man but, rather, to have these qualities as a woman. Mary s rousing rhetoric so mobilised the people of London that when Thomas Wyatt approached the Tower he found Ludgate barred against him. The rebels were compelled to lay down their arms and sue for mercy. Mary was manifestly an effective public speaker well before her sister Elizabeth garnered the plaudits. Mary s reputation has been almost entirely defined by religion and summed up by the infamous epithet  Bloody Mary . Elizabethan Protestants, who were the first to write the history of Mary s reign, characterised the regime as violently repressive, spiritually moribund and resoundingly unsuccessful. Yet in many ways Mary s programme to convert hearts and minds to Roman Catholicism was innovative and energetic. Led by Cardinal Reginald Pole, the programme of recatholicisation encouraged preaching and used the printing press to produce homilies and catechisms, and to foster a parochial revival of Catholicism. Even the burnings   the accepted punishment for heresy at the time   were, it has been argued, broadly effective. Laymen were fully and enthusiastically involved in the work of detecting heretics, and by 1558 the numbers being burned were falling. The Marian church was proving successful in its mission   but then Mary died prematurely, after just five years of rule and with no Catholic heir. Forgotten victory Traditional assessments of Mary s queenship have focused heavily on the apparent military failures of her reign, as epitomised by the loss of Calais in the Anglo-French war of 1557 59. Such a failure contrasts with Elizabeth s victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588. While Elizabeth I is popularly remembered as a triumphant warrior queen, Mary is pilloried as achieving only national military humiliation. Certainly, the loss of Calais has cast a long shadow over Mary s reputation. Yet assessments of Mary s military prowess should be rethought. Before the loss of Calais, she experienced successes. In August 1557, English and Spanish forces captured St-Quentin, an action in which some 3,000 French troops were killed and 7,000 captured, including their commander Anne de Montmorency, the constable of France. The news was greeted in England with widespread celebrations. London chroniclers heralded the success of  the king, our master    Mary s husband was now accepted. The political community was motivated for the national war effort in King Philip s service. But, weeks later, the English experienced the humiliating defeat that would stamp a decisive imprint on Mary s reign. As the last remnant of the English claim to France, Calais had a symbolic value that was out of proportion to its economic and military importance. Despite the brevity of her reign, Mary extended royal authority in the localities, managed her parliament, rebuilt the navy, reorganised the militia and laid the foundations for reform of the coinage and the restructuring of the economy. New markets for exports were developed in Guinea, the Baltic and Russia, with the latter resulting in the formation of the Muscovy Company in 1558. The government s overhaul of the book of rates in the same year also increased the crown s revenues from customs. Statutes were passed that regulated the proper manufacture of particular wares and provided for more efficient and systematic production measures. Five hospitals were re-endowed by Mary, including the Savoy Hospital in London. Mary proved to be a conscientious and hardworking queen who was determined to be closely involved in government business and policymaking. She would, as the Venetian ambassador recorded, rise  at daybreak when, after saying her prayers and hearing mass in private , she would  transact business incessantly until after midnight . Mary ruled with the full measure of royal majesty and achieved much of what she set out to do. She won her rightful throne, married her Spanish prince and returned the country to Roman Catholicism. The Spanish marriage was a match with the most powerful ruling house in Europe, and the highly favourable marriage treaty ultimately won the support of the English government. She had defeated rebels and preserved the Tudor monarchy. Her Catholicism was influenced by her humanist education and showed many signs of broad acceptance before she died. She was an intelligent, politically adept and resolute monarch   very much her own woman. Redefining the monarchy Once seen as weak willed and lacking in leadership qualities, Mary is now heralded as courageous and warlike, educated for rule and politically determined. Her early death   in the midst of disastrous harvest failures and a flu epidemic, and soon after the loss of Calais   ensured Mary s reputation was fatally sealed. If she had lived longer, her initiatives in religion and finance would have come to fruition; if she had borne a child, a Catholic future for England would have been assured. Nevertheless, by securing the throne, Mary ensured that the crown continued along the legal line of Tudor succession. As the first queen regnant of England she redefined royal ritual and law, thereby establishing that a female ruler, married or unmarried, would enjoy identical power and authority to male monarchs. Mary was the Tudor trailblazer, a political pioneer whose reign redefined the English monarchy. Her successor had the advantage of being the second woman to rule. Though she would never acknowledge it, Elizabeth built on the foundations laid by her sister, and received from her an invaluable political education. After Mary s death, the coronation robes of England s first queen were hastily refurbished   with a new bodice and sleeves   to fit its second. This outfit was just one of many things Elizabeth borrowed from her predecessor. Dr Anna Whitelock is a historian and broadcaster based at Royal Holloway, University of London, and author of Elizabeth s Bedfellows: An Intimate History of the Queen s Court (Bloomsbury, 2013) Ad This article was first published in the Christmas 2014 issue of BBC History Magazine",
        "target_summary": "Mary I, historically known by the pejorative \"Bloody Mary,\" was long portrayed by Protestant writers as a fanatical bigot whose disastrous reign was defined by religious persecution. However, a re-examination reveals England's first acknowledged queen regnant as a profoundly courageous and politically astute monarch who significantly redefined the English crown.\n\nHaving faced a tumultuous youth, demoted and declared illegitimate by Henry VIII, Mary staunchly defended her Catholic faith. Following Edward VI's death, she orchestrated a remarkable coup d'état, skillfully rallying support across East Anglia to reclaim her rightful throne from Lady Jane Grey—a decisive and singular achievement against central government in 16th-century England.\n\nNavigating the unprecedented challenge of female rule in a deeply patriarchal society, Mary masterfully asserted her authority. She passed the Act for Regal Power, legally establishing queens held power \"fully, wholly and absolutely\" like kings, and embraced traditional male monarchical rituals, proving the crown's authority transcended gender. Her strategic marriage to Philip of Spain, though controversial, was beneficial for England. When a Protestant rebellion erupted against it, Mary fearlessly rallied Londoners with a powerful Guildhall speech, demonstrating her formidable courage and rhetorical skill *as a woman*.\n\nWhile her vigorous re-Catholicisation program, including burnings for heresy (a common punishment of the era), solidified her infamous reputation, it was an innovative initiative cut short by her premature death. Beyond religion, Mary's brief but impactful reign saw significant reforms: she rebuilt the navy, reorganized the militia, reformed the economy, and expanded trade. Despite the symbolic loss of Calais, earlier military successes like St-Quentin demonstrated her capacity for leadership.\n\nUltimately, Mary I was an intelligent, resolute, and effective ruler who achieved her primary goals of securing her rightful throne, forging a powerful alliance, and restoring Catholicism. A true trailblazer, her pioneering reign redefined royal authority for future female monarchs, laying crucial foundations and providing an invaluable political education for her successor, Elizabeth I. Her early demise tragically obscured her many accomplishments and cemented a negative legacy that modern scholarship now actively challenges.",

        "title": "Joan of Kent: a perfect princess?",
        "content": "The marriage of Edward, Prince of Wales, on 10 October 1361 in the chapel at Windsor was reported by all the contemporary chroniclers, as befitted his importance as heir to the throne. The prince was 31, tall and handsome, the hero of Cr cy and Poitiers; he was a gifted, successful and popular soldier and commander. Posthumously known as the Black Prince, his biographer, the Chandos Herald, tells us that Edward was renowned throughout Europe as the epitome of a chivalric knight. Ad His bride, described by Jean Froissart as  the most beautiful woman in all the realm of England , wore a red dress with cloth of gold decorated with birds. Joan, Duchess of Cornwall, Countess of Chester and Countess of Kent, was the first member of the English royal family to bear the title Princess of Wales. The service was conducted by the archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Islip, in the presence of the prince s parents   Edward III and Queen Philippa, the rest of the royal family and the most important members of the clergy and nobility. The prince was deeply in love; in 1367 he addressed his wife as  my dearest and truest sweetheart and well beloved companion . The marriage was very successful, the couple were happy and their union blessed with two sons, Prince Edward (born 1365) and Prince Richard (the future Richard II, born 1367). Yet, despite the prince s love for his bride, she was in many ways a surprising choice, and, it has been argued, an unsuitable one. Heirs to the throne were expected to make a match that would bring political and diplomatic advantages to the crown. With these objectives in mind, the prince s father (Edward III), grandfather (Edward II), and great-grandfather (Edward I) had all married foreign princesses. Arguably, there was an even greater need for Prince Edward to do likewise. In 1340 Edward III had made a claim to the French throne, starting the lengthy conflict with France known as the Hundred Years  War. The stunning military successes culminating in the capture of the French king at Poitiers in 1356 had brought a cessation of hostilities. The ensuing treaty of Br tigny in 1360 granted the English crown much of the disputed lands in France. Edward III had needed allies to help achieve these results, and would need them again to help him keep the fruits of the treaty. A royal marriage was an obvious and usual way to cement an important alliance. Indeed, several foreign matches had been proposed for the prince over the years, but none had come to fruition. Either the proposed alliance had lost its attraction for the king, or it was thwarted by the requirement for a papal dispensation, which the pope, favouring France, refused to give. At 31, the prince was unmarried and free to marry the woman of his choice. His sweetheart (whom he called Jeanette) was his cousin Joan, the daughter of Edmund, Earl of Kent. Marriage to Joan would not bring any political or diplomatic advantage, nor would it enhance the prestige of the English crown in any way. In addition, Joan was a widow with four children. Image of Joan of Kent dating from around 1380. (Hulton Archive/Getty Images) However, Joan was not ineligible. She had royal blood; her father was Edward I s youngest son. She was also extremely wealthy, having inherited her father s estates. Although the king needed allies for his war against France, financial security for his sons evidently outweighed the alternative advantages of foreign alliances. With their father s blessing, three of Prince Edward s younger brothers had all married wealthy noblewomen. Following the treaty of Br tigny, Edward III planned that his heir would take over the lands held in France as the newly created principality of Aquitaine, and rule in his name without financial help from the English crown. Locally raised taxes could not be guaranteed to cover the costs. The prince s resources would be stretched, making Joan s wealth a significant attraction. But if eligible by virtue of her birth and wealth, Joan s marital history was a cause of concern. In 1340, aged 12 and under the guardianship of the king and queen, Joan had secretly married Thomas Holand, a humble household knight. A year later Joan s widowed mother and uncle arranged her marriage to William Montague, heir to the Earl of Salisbury, a close friend of the king. A reluctant Joan was forced into a bigamous marriage. For the next eight years Holand and Montague contested their respective rights to Joan. In November 1349 the pope pronounced in favour of Thomas Holand, the deciding factor being Joan s evidence supporting him. Thomas Holand became one of Edward III s most trusted commanders in France, and was created Earl of Kent shortly before he died after a short illness in December 1360. His marriage to Joan was a success, with four children born over 10 years, and Joan was almost the only noblewoman of her generation to accompany her husband as he fulfilled his military duties in France. But their secret marriage and the wrangle over Joan s marital status had a lasting effect on her reputation. In 1399, 14 years after her death, the chronicler Adam of Usk described Joan as a mother  given to slippery ways   to say nothing of many other things I have heard . With this marital history, Joan could hardly be regarded as an ideal choice for the heir to the throne. Especially as in 1361 William Montague was still very much alive (albeit married to someone else). Jean Froissart suggested that the marriage did not have royal approval, and even the archbishop of Canterbury expressed his reservations to the prince. However, far from disapproving of the match, Edward III went to extraordinary lengths to secure his heir s marriage. The king and his son were well aware that Joan s marital history could cause problems, particularly for the succession. Avoidance of this depended on ensuring the legal validity of the royal marriage. A papal dispensation was required. After the prince initially petitioned the pope without success, the king effectively blackmailed him by claiming that the prince was already secretly married to Joan. Rather than offend the English crown by refusing, Innocent VI agreed to the request. He issued a comprehensive bull that reaffirmed the validity of the original Holand marriage, provided dispensation for the prince s marriage, and confirmed the legitimacy of any offspring of the royal marriage. Mindful that a new pope might overturn his predecessor s decision, a further confirmatory dispensation was obtained from Innocent VI s successor, Urban V. In gratitude the prince donated rather more to the church than the papal dispensation required, endowing Canterbury Cathedral handsomely. With such effort expended on legitimising the marriage, what was expected of the new Princess of Wales? Joan would of course be expected to provide the prince with an heir, but in addition, how she behaved and was regarded by her peers would be crucial. Any stigma that attached to her would reflect on her husband, and on the crown. Worse, it might instigate a challenge to the royal marriage that the king had gone to such lengths to validate. Joan more than justified the efforts made to ensure she was the prince s legal spouse. Her behaviour as Princess of Wales was exemplary. After their marriage the prince set up court in Aquitaine, with Joan at his side. Contemporary accounts describe Joan as a loving and faithful wife and within six years she had given birth to two sons. In 1367 the prince fought his last major campaign in Spain, leaving his wife to preside over their court. Although victorious at the battle of N jera, the prince returned with a serious illness from which he never recovered. After the tragic early death of their eldest son, Prince Edward, the couple returned to England in 1371. The prince s poor health forced him to rely on his wife to represent him, and her role became more public. Joan resolutely kept out of politics but built up close and harmonious relationships with the prince s family, especially her powerful brother-in-law John of Gaunt, and with many of the most powerful nobles. Despite their marital debacle, William Montague remained a close friend. As it became clear that the prince was unlikely to survive his father, with Edward III also in failing health, the likelihood was that Joan s son Richard would succeed as a minor. The prince died in 1376, when Richard was nine. Joan s devotion to the prince and her discreet conduct as his wife had won her respect and trust, and there was no suggestion that Richard should be removed from her care. Joan s son, King Richard II. Portrait by an unknown artist, 1390. (DeAgostini/Getty Images) Prince Richard, aged 10, succeeded his grandfather as king in July 1377. Only twice before had a minor succeeded to the throne. Joan was the highest ranked woman at court, and with the king in her charge was in a position of considerable power and influence. Her reputation, and her cordial relationship with Richard s uncles, especially John of Gaunt, had helped ensure a smooth succession. Joan continued to be circumspect in her behaviour; she made no attempt to use her authority to direct events or to take a prominent role, nor did she take advantage of her position to benefit herself or anyone closely connected to her, even her two Holand sons. Supporting and protecting Richard became her priority; she ensured that his household was made up of his father s loyal retainers and she fostered family unity between Richard, his uncles, and her Holand children. Difficulties for Richard, in particular with John of Gaunt, were resolved by Joan s skilful advocacy and mediatory skills. In 1381 Richard s personal safety was seriously threatened in the violent unrest known as the Peasants  Revolt. In London, he became trapped in the Tower. Joan was in Canterbury, on her annual pilgrimage to the Black Prince s tomb. As soon as she heard of the disturbances in London, she made her way back to join Richard. Her popularity saved her from harm when she was accosted twice by groups of rebels. She made no attempt to intervene personally, simply providing Richard with the support of her presence. Richard s effective handling of the crisis showed Joan that he no longer needed her to protect him. After arranging his marriage to Anne of Bohemia in 1382 she quietly retired from court to Wallingford Castle. Yet, when she heard of the serious row between Richard and his half-brother John Holand in July 1385, Joan immediately attempted to intervene. Her death in August 1385 was attributed by the chronicler Walsingham to her broken heart at failing to reconcile the two. The Black Prince's tomb in Canterbury Cathedral, to which Joan made an annual pilgrimage. (RDImages/Epics/Getty) Joan was Princess of Wales for 24 years, and one of the most important and influential women of her age. If her reputation was dubious when she married the prince, it was almost beyond reproach when she died, loved and respected, mourned by many outside her immediate family and friends. Joan s personality was a substantial contributory factor to her success as Princess of Wales. As a child she had shown independence and courage in choosing to marry and stay with Thomas Holand. As an adult she showed that she was gentle, warm and loving   a natural peacemaker with an innate ability to get on well with people. The Chandos Herald summed up her contemporary reputation with his description of her as beautiful, pleasant and wise. His description has proved remarkably enduring, and it is by her posthumously bestowed sobriquet of the  Fair Maid of Kent  that Joan is best known. As Princess of Wales, Joan set a standard of behaviour for others to admire and emulate. She was, in many ways, the perfect princess. Ad Penny Lawne is author of Joan of Kent: The First Princess of Wales (Amberley, 2015).",
        "target_summary": "In 1361, the renowned Edward, Prince of Wales – the celebrated hero of Crécy and Poitiers, known posthumously as the Black Prince, and hailed throughout Europe as the epitome of chivalry – married his beloved cousin, Joan, in a grand ceremony at Windsor. At 31, the tall, handsome Prince was deeply in love with Joan, whom chroniclers described as the \"most beautiful woman in all the realm of England,\" resplendent in a red gown woven with cloth of gold. This union, which saw Joan become the first Princess of Wales, was celebrated by the entire royal family, including King Edward III and Queen Philippa, and would prove a happy and fruitful one, blessed with two sons, Prince Edward and the future Richard II.\n\nYet, despite the palpable affection and success of their marriage, Joan was, by conventional standards, a profoundly surprising, even unsuitable, choice for an heir to the throne. Royal matches were typically forged for political and diplomatic advantage, a necessity exacerbated by the ongoing Hundred Years' War with France, which demanded powerful foreign alliances. Numerous proposals for the Prince had fallen through, often thwarted by papal disapproval. Joan, a widowed cousin with four children, offered no such strategic benefits, nor did she enhance the crown's prestige.\n\nHowever, Joan's eligibility lay in other crucial areas: her royal lineage, as a granddaughter of Edward I, and her considerable inherited wealth. With Edward III planning for his heir to rule the newly established Principality of Aquitaine without financial aid from England, Joan's fortune became a significant attraction, outweighing the traditional advantages of foreign alliances. Still, her past was fraught with scandal. At just 12, she had secretly married the humble knight Thomas Holand, only to be forcibly entered into a bigamous union with William Montague a year later. An eight-year legal battle ensued, culminating in a papal ruling validating her first marriage to Holand. This complex history, which earned her a reputation for \"slippery ways\" among some chroniclers, and the fact that Montague was still alive, raised eyebrows and garnered reservations from figures like Jean Froissart and the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nNevertheless, King Edward III was resolute in securing his heir's marriage, taking extraordinary measures to ensure its legitimacy and prevent any challenges to the succession. Aware of the potential issues, the King effectively \"blackmailed\" Pope Innocent VI by claiming the Prince was already secretly married to Joan. This led to a comprehensive papal bull that not only reaffirmed the validity of Joan's original marriage to Holand but also provided a crucial dispensation for her union with the Prince, confirming the legitimacy of any future offspring. Further papal confirmation was sought from the next Pope, Urban V, cementing the legality of the marriage, a gesture the Prince repaid with handsome donations to Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nAs Princess of Wales, Joan's conduct proved exemplary, silencing critics and justifying the King's efforts. She bore two sons and dedicated herself as a loving and faithful wife, presiding with grace over the Aquitaine court during the Prince's campaigns. When the Black Prince returned to England gravely ill, Joan's role became more public; she discreetly represented him and skillfully cultivated harmonious relationships within the royal family, even with former adversaries like William Montague. Her devotion and conduct earned her profound respect and trust.\n\nUpon the Black Prince's death in 1376, Joan's integrity and strong familial ties ensured a smooth succession for her nine-year-old son, Richard II. As the highest-ranked woman at court, she wielded considerable influence but exercised it with remarkable circumspection, never exploiting her position for personal gain. Her priority remained protecting and supporting Richard, fostering unity within the royal household and mediating disputes with his powerful uncles, particularly John of Gaunt. During the perilous Peasants' Revolt in 1381, her immense popularity saved her from harm, and she provided steadfast, though indirect, support to Richard, witnessing his growth into a capable ruler.\n\nAfter arranging Richard's marriage in 1382, Joan quietly retired from court. Yet, her lifelong role as a peacemaker led to her final, tragic act of devotion: a desperate, ultimately fatal, attempt to reconcile a furious Richard with her half-brother in 1385, reportedly dying of a broken heart. Over her 24 years as Princess of Wales, Joan transformed a dubious early reputation into one \"beyond reproach,\" earning widespread love and respect. Remembered by the Chandos Herald as \"beautiful, pleasant and wise,\" and affectionately known as the \"Fair Maid of Kent,\" Joan's courageous independence, warmth, and innate ability to connect with people established her as one of the most important and influential women of her age, truly setting the standard for the \"perfect princess.\"",

        "content": "Ad 1703: Building begins at Buckingham Palace The palace was originally built in 1703 as Buckingham House, a London home for the 3rd Earl of Mulgrave, John Sheffield. It became a royal residence when King George III purchased it in 1761 as a comfortable family home for his wife, Queen Charlotte. Fourteen of George and Charlotte s 15 children were born there. Buckingham House underwent a palatial transformation in the 1820s, when King George IV employed architect John Nash to give it a royal renovation. Queen Victoria was the first monarch to adopt Buckingham Palace as her official residence, moving there in 1837, within a year of becoming queen. She oversaw the last major construction work at the palace, adding the front wing in the 1840s to give her large family extra space. In 1883 electricity was installed in the ballroom, the largest room in the palace. Over the following four years electricity was installed throughout the palace, which now uses more than 40,000 lightbulbs. Buckingham House, 1746. Built in 1703, the house forms the architectural core of the present-day Buckingham Palace.

Queen Victoria made the first recorded royal appearance on the balcony in 1851, when she greeted the public during celebrations for the opening of the Great Exhibition, a groundbreaking showcase of international manufacturing, masterminded by Prince Albert. Appearances on the balcony are now a popular part of royal events. In 2002 Queen Elizabeth II waved to crowds from the balcony as more than a million people flocked to Buckingham Palace to celebrate her Golden Jubilee. More than 200 million viewers around the world watched the evening s  Party at the Palace  concert on television. At their wedding in 2011, Prince William and Kate Middleton also appeared on the famous balcony. The newlyweds shared a kiss, much to the delight of the crowds.

Following the wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on 10 February 1840, their second child [and eldest son], Edward was born at the palace on 9 November 1841. Known to his family as  Bertie , Edward spent much of his childhood at the palace with his eight siblings. In 1902 Edward underwent major surgery at Buckingham Palace. Close to death from appendicitis, he was successfully operated on in a room overlooking the garden. Later that year [following his recovery] he was crowned at Westminster Abbey after nearly 60 years as heir to the throne. After years of excessive cigar and cigarette consumption, in 1910 Edward contracted a severe case of bronchitis. He died at Buckingham Palace on 6 May 1910 following a series of heart attacks, and was succeeded by his son King George V. Following a royal birth or death, a notice was attached to the railings of Buckingham Palace to alert members of the public. Even today, this traditional custom is upheld.

Led by Emmeline Pankhurst, the women began processing towards the palace from Grosvenor Gardens, declaring their intention to deliver a petition to the king. The protest attracted sensationalist and unsympathetic press coverage. The Daily Mirror carried the headline  Mrs Pankhurst arrested at the gates of Buckingham Palace in trying to present a petition to the King , surrounded by photographs of clashes between the protestors and police. It described  distressing scenes  in which a  body of militant suffragettes  led by Pankhurst  endeavoured to carry out their impossible scheme , evading police and making it to the gates of the palace. The Telegraph, meanwhile, described a  serious fracas between the wild women and the police, in which the militants delivered a brief but furious attack on the constables . When she reached the palace gates, Emmeline Pankhurst was arrested. The Telegraph suggested she  was able to offer little or no resistance, but shouting out that she had got to the palace gates, she was carried bodily by a chief inspector to a private motor which the police had in waiting . Following her arrest, Pankhurst was taken to Holloway Prison. Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst is arrested outside Buckingham Palace in May 1914.

Her younger sister Princess Margaret, who was seven years old, also signed up as a Brownie. The Girl Guide Association had been formed in 1910 by Agnes Baden Powell, as an alternative girl s organisation to scouting. As it was believed that the princesses should live as normal lives as possible, they were enrolled to join the popular organisation by their aunt, Princess Mary. The 1st Buckingham Palace Company was then formed, which included some 20 Guides and 14 Brownies, made up of children of royal household members and Buckingham Palace employees. A summerhouse in the palace garden became the Guides  headquarters, with the princesses reportedly cooking on campfires, pitching tents and earning badges like any other Guides. Following the outbreak of the Second World War the summerhouse headquarters was closed down due to the bomb threat and moved to the more rural setting of Windsor Castle. In 1952 Queen Elizabeth and her mother became joint patrons of the Girl Guides. Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II, right) and her younger sister Princess Margaret dressed as guides in 1943.

Queen Elizabeth [later the Queen Mother] declared:  The children will not leave unless I do. I shall not leave unless their father does, and the king will not leave the country in any circumstances, whatever . However, the decision to remain in Britain placed the royal family in significant danger   the palace received nine direct bomb hits during the course of the war and on 8 March 1941 PC Steve Robertson, a policeman on duty at the Palace, was killed by flying debris when a bomb hit. In a letter to her mother-in-law, Queen Mary, the queen recalled one particularly difficult night of bombing at the palace in 1940, when the palace chapel was destroyed. In it she recounts how she was  battling  to remove an eyelash from the king's eye when they heard the  unmistakable whirr-whirr of a German plane  and then the  scream of a bomb . She recalled how  it all happened so quickly that we had only time to look foolishly at each other when the scream hurtled past us and exploded with a tremendous crash in the quadrangle . Despite the palace bombings, the royal family remained defiant.  I am glad we have been bombed , Queen Elizabeth declared in September 1940,  Now we can look the East End in the eye .

Winston Churchill appeared with the king, queen and the two royal princesses on the palace s balcony before huge crowds. Throughout the course of the day the royal family made a total of eight appearances on the balcony to wave to those celebrating below. During their father s final balcony appearance of the day the princesses Margaret and Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) secretly joined the cheering crowd below. Elizabeth later recalled:  We stood outside and shouted,  We want the king  I think it was one of the most memorable nights of my life . Ad King George VI also delivered a radio address to his nation, played on loud speakers in Trafalgar Square. He praised Britons  resilience and honoured those who had lost their lives.  Let us remember those who will not come back  he declared,  let us remember the men in all the services, and the women in all the services, who have laid down their lives. We have come to the end of our tribulation and they are not with us at the moment of our rejoicing .",
        "target_summary": "Buckingham Palace, a majestic symbol of the British monarchy, began its storied existence in 1703 as Buckingham House, a private London dwelling for the 3rd Earl of Mulgrave. Its royal destiny commenced in 1761 when King George III acquired it for his wife, Queen Charlotte, transforming it into a comfortable family home. A grand palatial metamorphosis ensued in the 1820s under King George IV, who commissioned architect John Nash for a magnificent royal renovation. Queen Victoria solidified its status, making it her official residence in 1837 and overseeing the addition of the iconic front wing. By the late 19th century, modernity arrived with the widespread installation of electricity throughout the palace, which now boasts over 40,000 lightbulbs.\n\nThe palace's iconic balcony has since become a stage for significant royal moments and public celebration. Queen Victoria pioneered this tradition in 1851, greeting crowds during the Great Exhibition. Decades later, it bore witness to Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee in 2002 and the joyous wedding kiss of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011, captivating millions worldwide.\n\nBeyond these public spectacles, Buckingham Palace has been a place of profound personal events. Edward VII holds the unique distinction of being the only monarch both born and to have died within its walls, experiencing significant life moments there from his birth in 1841 to his passing in 1910. The palace also fostered a sense of normalcy for young royals, as in 1937, Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and Princess Margaret formed the 1st Buckingham Palace Girl Guide Company with children of household staff, engaging in typical Guide activities within the palace gardens.\n\nBeyond royal intimate life, the palace has stood as a backdrop for significant social change. In 1914, it became a focal point for the women's suffrage movement, as Emmeline Pankhurst led 20,000 suffragettes in a spirited march to the gates, culminating in her arrest and drawing sensational press attention.\n\nDuring the sombre years of World War II, Buckingham Palace emerged as a powerful emblem of royal resilience. The royal family famously defied advice to evacuate, with Queen Elizabeth declaring their unwavering commitment to remain. Despite suffering nine direct bomb hits and the destruction of its chapel, the palace, and its inhabitants, remained resolute, embodying the nation's defiant spirit. The Queen famously stated her gladness at being bombed, allowing them to \"look the East End in the eye.\"\n\nFollowing the war, the palace transformed into a vibrant center of national jubilation on VE Day in 1945. The King, Queen, and their daughters, including the future Queen Elizabeth II, made multiple balcony appearances to wave to ecstatic crowds. In a memorable moment, the princesses even slipped away to join the cheering public below, experiencing the euphoria of peace firsthand.\n\nFrom its origins as a grand house to its evolution into a world-renowned royal palace and a stage for both personal milestones and national dramas, Buckingham Palace stands as a living testament to British history, embodying tradition, resilience, and an enduring connection to its people.",

        "title": "Not such a prude after all: the secrets of Henry VIII s love life",
        "content": "When it comes to Henry VIII s love life, the biographical focus usually falls on Henry s wives and is dominated by his quest for a son. This is no surprise given its dynastic importance and the comparative paucity of material surviving on Henry s mistresses. Indeed, Henry is often compared to his lusty and syphilitic contemporary, Francis I of France, whose antics leave the English king in the shade. Henry certainly had no official mistress in the French style, although he did offer this title to Anne Boleyn, who refused it. There is also the question of Henry s health, as when considering his personal life images of his obesity and injuries can easily eclipse those of his handsome youth. It may be, though, that tradition has him all wrong. Ad Henry wasn t so much a prude as a very private man. While Francis paraded his mistresses in public, Henry preferred to keep his extramarital liaisons known only to a small circle of loyal intimates: his chief minister, his gentlemen of the chamber and his closest friends, many of whom went to the block for treason in the 1530s, contributing to the silence over the king s private affairs. Henry valued secrecy and discretion when it came to his personal relationships and although he was at the centre of a busy court, he had the means to achieve this. Henry s success in this regard becomes clearer when we consider the two mistresses that are known to have shared his bed, and the processes of history by which they were recorded. Elizabeth (or  Bessie ) Blount s name is remembered today because she was an unmarried mother who bore a surviving son, which the king chose to acknowledge. Usually kings favoured affairs with married women, whose pregnancies could be officially attributed to their husbands, even if the court gossips suspected otherwise. Bessie was quickly married off and her subsequent children, born soon after her son Henry FitzRoy, were given the surname of her pliant husband. Had Bessie s marriage taken place sooner, or her child been female or not survived, we would not know about her relations with Henry VIII. Likewise, our information about Henry s affair with Mary Boleyn derives from Henry s reluctant admission of affinity when he desired to marry her younger sister, Anne. Without these chance survivals, these accidents of history, the image we have of Henry today would be as a shining example of marital fidelity, and we know that was not the case. There is also a wealth of circumstantial evidence to suggest that Henry had a number of affairs or casual encounters. These are more than mere court rumours: cumulatively they offer a convincing picture. In 1513, when Henry stayed in Lille before the siege of Tournai, he stayed up all night dancing with a mysterious  Madame the Bastard,  barefoot and in his shirtsleeves. After returning to England, he received a letter from a maid of honour by the name of Etiennette de la Baume, in the Lille household of Margaret of Savoy. She asked for his assistance for her forthcoming marriage, reminding Henry of a promise he had made her  when we parted  and that he had called her his page. Another letter, dating from 1514, implicated the king in a flirtation being enjoyed by his friend Charles Brandon with two ladies of the English court, to whom Brandon had sent  tokens ; during his friend s absence abroad, Henry was to act as go-between and pass on his warm words. There was also Jane Popincourt, a maid of Henry s sister Mary, who was refused entry to France in 1514 by King Louis XII on account of her immorality. This, coupled with Henry s choice of her as a dance partner the following spring and his generous gift of  100 to allow her to leave, have led to speculation that Jane had shared his bed. Perhaps most interesting of all is the entry in the Privy Papers for 1537, when a William Webbe claimed Henry had stolen away his mistress and enjoyed her favours in  avowtry  (aka advowtry)   that is, adultery. The names of various other women have been proposed as mistresses of Henry, or as the mothers of his reputed illegitimate children Thomas Stukley, John Perrot and Ethelreda Malte, but these were never acknowledged by Henry and there is no evidence to connect him with them.

(The Print Collector/Getty Images) While the church advocated regular but moderate sex within marriage   for mutual comfort and procreation   Tudor medicine stated the importance of sex for health. Without it, fluids and vapours were thought to build up in the body and cause fits, fever and illness. Aristocratic wives were expected to be models of chastity in order to produce heirs but their husbands might seek sexual satisfaction elsewhere, typically with women of the lower classes. Couples were supposed to refrain from sleeping together during part, if not all, of the wife s pregnancies, and it was during Catherine of Aragon s first confinement that Henry s court was rocked by a scandal that implicated him with one of his wife s waiting women, Anne Hastings. Hastings may have been involved with both Henry and his closest friend, William Compton, with whom she certainly had an affair in later years. The Spanish ambassador Luis Caroz believed it was the king who had turned the newlywed s head, writing in 1510 that Anne was  much liked by the king, who went after her . Anne s sister was concerned enough about her behaviour to interfere, which resulted in her banishment from court for  tale-bearing  and  insidiously spying out every unwatched moment . This was what brought the matter to Catherine s attention, and the royal couple had their first serious argument as a result. Despite living at the heart of a busy court, Henry did not lack opportunities for romance. He drew on the discretion of friends such as William Compton, whose house in Thames Street provided a convenient location for liaisons, accessible by barge, and Thomas Wolsey, who oversaw the arrangements for Bessie Blount s lying-in, acted as godfather to her son. Although there might be prying eyes at court, when Henry visited the homes of his friends in the town or country, or stopped at a hunting lodge with a small retinue, leaving his wife at court, there was a greater degree of privacy to facilitate meeting women. Wherever he travelled, Henry took his own personal lock to guarantee secrecy. And yet, even under the scrutiny of his courtiers, Henry found the perfect vehicle for flirtation. His love of masques and dancing gave him a degree of licence for intimacy; under the guise of planning entertainments, he might  borrow  maids of honour in order to rehearse elaborate pageants that required dancing, costumes and song. Writers Juan Luis Vives in the 1520s and John Heywood in the 1530s both drew the connection between dancing and sex, with the lines of contemporary plays full of bawdy and suggestive lyrics. Characters in Heywood s 1533 The Play of the Weather joke about  meddling  with each other, about literal and metaphoric dirty linen, dallying  with your simper de cocker  and kissing a woman s behind. The arrangements of Henry s household would have facilitated affairs too. The Eltham Ordinances, published in January 1526, help us understand how. When it came to sleeping with his wife, the king followed a ritual involving a large amount of staff, including an elaborate procession through the corridors that needed to be cleared and guarded, followed by a ceremony of disrobing. This visible display provided a foil for the occasions when Henry desired privacy, at night amid the chambers  reserved secret, at the pleasure of his grace, without [the] repair of any great multitude . Henry s grooms were charged to remain  humble, reverent, secret and lowly  about all tasks, with two sleeping on pallets outside his door and Sir Henry Norris charged with preventing all other gentlemen from entering. With Norris s assistance, it would not have been difficult for Henry to admit whomever he pleased. Whatever secrets he may have known, Norris took to the grave a decade later, when he became one of the scapegoats in Anne Boleyn s fall. When it comes to Henry s relationship with Anne, a further mystery arises. Traditionally, the story has been told that it was Anne s refusal that maintained Henry s interest, and that for the seven years before their secret marriage Anne kept herself aloof, denying Henry consummation. Catherine had gone through the menopause in around 1525 and Anne did not conceive until the end of 1532: Catherine s menopause coincided with Henry s thirties, at a time when he was keen to father a son. Is it really realistic that the king was celibate throughout this time? And if not, who exactly was he sleeping with? Did he continue to share a bed with Catherine, intermittently, up to the day in July 1531 when Henry rode away from her at Windsor and she was never to see him again? Perhaps Anne permitted Henry some liberties with her person after she had agreed to his proposal in around 1527. In one letter Henry refers to kissing her breasts or  pretty duckies,  and they may have enjoyed a certain degree of intimacy, stopping short of full penetration. The fact that Anne did not fall pregnant until December 1532 suggests they were restrained, or else practised some form of contraception. Early condoms were available, known as the  Venus Glove  and manufactured by glovers. They were expensive, but Henry could have afforded them. Yet Anne s allure lay in her promise and her desire not to be discarded as her sister had been. Nor did Henry wish to risk the arrival of a child before he was in a position to be able to marry her. It is far more in keeping with the mores of the time that Henry resorted to the occasional casual encounter, discreetly arranged by his gentlemen, and considered to be an essential bodily function, just as eating or sleeping. The needs of the king s body must be met. A depiction of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn s first meeting, from 1835. (Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) In later years, Henry s ulcerous leg and increasing girth rendered him less able to play the nimble lover. Yet this really only applies to the final decade of his life. The young Henry was accustomed to having his own way and with the facilities and staff to ensure his own pleasure. The notion of a prudish, restrained king may be more the result of a paucity of evidence rather than a true reflection of Henry s character. Although he was not quite, as Francis I was described,  of such slight morals that he slips readily into the gardens of other and drinks from the water of many fountains , the surviving shreds of evidence suggest Henry VIII enjoyed a full and active love life. This also provides an important reflection upon the nature of evidence and its survival. As late as 1817, when John Lingard cited the letter in which Henry admitted to having slept with Mary Boleyn, his fellow rejected the claims as a deliberate slur upon the reputation of her sister, Anne. When it comes to the sexual secrets of such a secretive Tudor monarch, it is imperative to consider the holes in the evidence as much as the evidence itself. Here was a man who married five out of his six wives in private, in a departure from the example set by his parents. Henry didn t want the details of his love life to be made public: five centuries later, he has largely succeeded.

        "target_summary": "Often portrayed as a monarch whose romantic pursuits solely centered on his numerous wives and desperate quest for a male heir, Henry VIII's private love life was, in fact, far more vibrant and deliberately concealed than history typically suggests. While his French contemporary, Francis I, brazenly paraded his mistresses, Henry was a master of discretion, ensuring his extramarital liaisons remained known only to a tight-knit circle of loyal intimates. This deliberate secrecy, coupled with the tragic fates of those who guarded his secrets, has largely contributed to the sparse historical record surrounding his affairs.\n\nIndeed, the few acknowledged mistresses surfaced almost by historical accident. Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Blount, for instance, is remembered primarily because she bore Henry an acknowledged illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy. Had her child been female, not survived, or if she had been married sooner, her story would likely have vanished into obscurity. Similarly, Mary Boleyn's affair came to light only when Henry sought to marry her sister Anne, forcing him to reluctantly admit their prior intimacy due to church law. These isolated revelations hint at a broader, largely undocumented landscape of royal dalliances.\n\nBeyond these two, a rich tapestry of circumstantial evidence and whispers from the Tudor court paints a compelling picture of Henry's active love life. From a flirtatious night of dancing with \"Madame the Bastard\" in Lille in 1513, to intriguing letters from a maid of honour referencing a past promise, and even accusations of stealing another man's mistress in 1537, numerous tantalizing clues suggest a king who frequently indulged his passions. The reputations of women like Jane Popincourt, banished for \"immorality,\" further fuel speculation, hinting at more than mere casual acquaintances.\n\nIn a Tudor era where medicine stressed the importance of sex for health, and aristocratic husbands often sought satisfaction outside marriage (especially during their wives' frequent pregnancies), Henry's private conduct aligns with the period's mores. He did not lack for opportunities, skillfully employing a sophisticated network of trusted friends and carefully orchestrated environments. The homes of confidantes like William Compton offered secluded venues, accessible by barge, while hunting lodges provided a convenient escape from courtly scrutiny. Henry even carried his own personal lock to guarantee privacy wherever he traveled.\n\nHis own elaborate court rituals inadvertently provided perfect cover for secret encounters. While the king's marital bed procession was a highly visible affair, his household also contained \"secret\" chambers where, with the assistance of discreet grooms, he could admit whomever he pleased, unobserved. Furthermore, Henry cleverly utilized the era's social liberties, turning masques and dancing into vehicles for flirtation. Under the guise of planning elaborate entertainments, he could \"borrow\" maids of honour for rehearsals, transforming a public activity into a space for intimate, even suggestive, interaction. Contemporary writers even drew explicit connections between dancing and sexual activity, reflecting the bawdy undertones of such gatherings.\n\nThe conventional narrative of Henry's seven-year pursuit of Anne Boleyn, during which he was supposedly celibate, also warrants scrutiny. Given Catherine of Aragon's menopause coincided with Henry's prime desire for a son, it is highly probable he sought solace and sexual release elsewhere, perhaps through discreetly arranged casual encounters. Such liaisons would have been considered an essential bodily function for the king, discreetly managed to avoid jeopardizing his pursuit of Anne or risking an unplanned child.\n\nWhile his later years saw his health decline and his famous girth grow, this was a transformation from a vigorous and virile young king. The image of a prudish, restrained Henry VIII is likely a byproduct of the deliberate suppression of evidence and the \"holes\" in historical records. Ultimately, Henry VIII succeeded remarkably in shrouding his sexual exploits in a veil of secrecy. Five centuries later, the full, active, and hidden love life of this intensely private monarch remains one of history's most intriguing, and successfully guarded, royal secrets.",

        "content": "Featuring 180 questions   both new and previously included in the BBC television programme's popular 'General Ignorance' round   the book explores historical topics from the Vikings to the Vietnam War. Ad Here we bring you five festive facts taken from the book  1) Prince Albert didn t bring the first Christmas tree to Britain The first Christmas tree in England went up in December 1800, when Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, gave a children s party. One of the grown-up guests remarked,  After the company had walked round and admired the tree, each child obtained a portion of the sweets it bore, together with a toy, and then all returned home quite delighted.  Christmas trees soon became wildly fashionable in high society, but it took 40 years (helped by the popular press) for them to catch on across the country. By then Queen Victoria s husband, Prince Albert, was busy importing them, which is why they are so often associated with him. The royal Christmas tree is admired by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and their children, in this December 1848 illustration. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Prince Albert and Queen Charlotte were both born in Germany, where families had been bringing evergreen trees indoors and putting candles on them since the sixteenth century. According to legend, the first person to do this was Martin Luther (1483 1546), better known for his role in the Protestant Reformation. One evening, it s said, he looked up at the night sky, saw the stars twinkling between a tree s branches, and decided to recreate the effect in his home. Luther was a controversial figure. He was also said to eat a spoonful of his own faeces every day. The Christmas tree story may be romantic fiction, but the German tradition of decorating trees indoors did begin in Luther s lifetime. Artificial Christmas trees became popular in Britain after the death of Queen Victoria, when large ostentatious trees suddenly seemed inappropriate. The first ones were made from goose feathers that were dyed green. These were also imported from Germany, where they had become fashionable as a way of conserving the country s fir tree population. But artificial Christmas trees only took off in the 1930s with mass production by the Addis Brush Company. Founded by William Addis, inventor of the toothbrush, they used the same machinery to make bristly branches that they used to make toilet brushes. Today artificial Christmas trees are seen as an environmentally conscious alternative to the real thing. Unfortunately, an independent study released in 2009 showed that, to be greener than buying a fresh-cut tree each year, you would have to reuse your plastic tree for more than 20 years. 2)  Jingle Bells  wasn t originally written as a Christmas song  Jingle Bells  is the only Christmas song that doesn t mention Christmas, Jesus or the Nativity. That s because it was written to celebrate Thanksgiving. Originally entitled  The One-Horse Open Sleigh ,  Jingle Bells  was the work of American composer James Lord Pierpont (1822 93), uncle of the financier J. P. Morgan. Pierpont s father commissioned it for a Thanksgiving service. Pierpont led a wild life   at 14 he ran away to sea and joined a whaling ship. At 27 he left his wife and children in Boston to join the California gold rush. After re-inventing himself as a photographer, he lost all his possessions in a fire and moved to Savannah, Georgia, where he joined the Confederate army during the Civil War. Throughout this period he continued to write songs, ballads and dance tunes, including Confederate battle hymns and  minstrel  songs for performance by white people with blacked-up faces. Some of his less festive tunes include  We Conquer or Die  and  Strike for the South . The states of Massachusetts and Georgia both claim Pierpont was there when he wrote  Jingle Bells  in 1857. Wherever he was, he made very little money out of it and never lived to see his song s enormous popularity.  Jingle Bells  was the first tune played live in space. On 16 December 1965, as US astronauts Wally Schirra and Tom Stafford were preparing to re-enter the Earth s atmosphere in Gemini VI, Stafford contacted Mission Control to report a UFO.  We have an object, looks like a satellite going from north to south, probably in polar orbit . . . Looks like he might be going to re-enter soon . . . I see a command module and eight smaller modules in front. The pilot of the command module is wearing a red suit.  Before Houston could respond, Schirra began playing  Jingle Bells  on a harmonica he d smuggled aboard in his spacesuit. He was accompanied by Stafford on sleigh bells.  Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer  started life as a colouring book devised by US advertising copywriter Robert May in 1939. His reindeer was originally called  Reginald  but he changed his mind at the last minute and the book sold 2 million copies in its first Christmas alone. The song was written a decade later by May s brother-in-law Johnny Marks, who also wrote  Rockin  Around the Christmas Tree . Marks was Jewish, joining a tradition of Jewish songwriters behind classic Christmas songs, including  White Christmas  (Irving Berlin),  Let It Snow  (Sammy Cahn) and  Santa Baby  (Joan Javits).

(Photo by Transcendental Graphics/Getty Images) The story of  Winter Wonderland  (1934) is a sad one. The lyrics were inspired by watching children playing in the snow outside the sanatorium where songwriter Dick Smith was dying of tuberculosis. 3) Jesus  mum didn t call him Jesus For a start, when Jesus lived in Galilee, the letter  J  didn t exist. In Hebrew, his name was Yeshua or Yehoshua   from which we get the name Joshua. In Aramaic (the language he probably spoke at home) it was Isho or Yeshu. When the Gospels were translated from Hebrew into Greek, Yeshua became Iesous. When the Greek was rendered into Latin, it became Iesus. Joshua and Jesus were once the same name. Classical Latin had no letter J   Caesar was Iulius, not Julius. Except for a handful of borrowed foreign words, modern Italian still has no J. The letter J wasn t really in common use until the seventeenth century, at first to distinguish between words with  i  as a consonant, pronounced as  y  in  iest  (jest) and the short vowel sound  i , as in  it  or  inch . J wasn t used in English until around 1630, so Shakespeare never used it either   he wrote Romeo and Iuliet, King Iohn and, like Caesar himself, Iulius Caesar. In time, J came to be spoken in English like the Old English  dj  sound, as in  hedge , while in Spanish J still has a  Y  sound  and in French it s halfway between the two. In Hebrew Jesus  father s name was Yusuf, not Joseph, and Jesus would have been Yeshua ben Yusuf ( Joshua, son of Joseph ). It s possible neither of them were carpenters. The Hebrew word used to describe what they did is naggara (tekton in Greek). It only comes up twice in the New Testament and other possible meanings are  architect ,  stone mason  and  builder    so Jesus may have been a brickie rather than a chippie. In 2012 more than 4,000 American children were given the first name Jesus. There were also 800 Messiahs, and 29 Christs. 4) The holiday celebrated on 26 December every year is not Boxing Day Boxing Day in Britain is defined as  the first working day after Christmas , so it s not always on 26 December. For example, if Christmas Day falls on a Friday, Boxing Day is on Monday the 28th, because the Saturday and Sunday aren t working days. When Christmas falls on a Saturday, Boxing Day is on Monday the 27th (the next working day) and, to make up for Christmas Day being on a weekend, the Christmas Bank Holiday moves to Tuesday the 28th   so that, in one sense, Boxing Day sometimes comes before Christmas. But there is a holiday that always takes place on 26 December: the Feast of St Stephen. Appropriately for someone whose feast day comes the day after Christmas, St Stephen is the patron saint of headaches. He also looks after deacons, horses and coffin makers, and is the patron saint of stone workers   which is grimly ironic as he was the first Christian martyr to be stoned to death. St Stephen s Day is celebrated as an official public holiday throughout most of Europe; only Commonwealth countries celebrate Boxing Day instead. The name comes from the British tradition of giving small  Christmas boxes , containing money or treats, to workers for their service throughout the year. 5) You don t need to take down your Christmas decorations by Twelfth Night Taking down decorations on Twelfth Night (5 or 6 January) is a modern superstition. For many centuries they were kept up until Candlemas Eve, 1 February. Candlemas celebrates Mary and Joseph taking the baby Jesus to the Temple at Jerusalem and presenting him to the Lord. According to St Luke s gospel they had to sacrifice two pigeons to do so. Early Christmas decorations consisted mainly of greenery, which kept the house looking cheerful even when the weather outside was miserable. Some people clung to older, pre-Christian beliefs about these   namely that they contained woodland spirits who, if you left the decorations up, would cause mischief in your house. Careful householders took them down and burned them just to make sure. A photograph of a woman and a little girl decorating a Christmas tree, taken by Photographic Advertising Limited in about 1948. This photograph was sold for use in the Christmas 1948 issue of Mother magazine. (Photo by SSPL/Getty Images) In North America Candlemas is celebrated as Groundhog Day. Groundhogs are large rodents related to squirrels and, according to folklore, if it s cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day, spring will come early. If it s sunny, the winter weather will persist for six more weeks. Of course, the groundhog has no interest in weather forecasting: he s looking for a mate. Recent statistics, released by the USA s National Climatic Data Center, \"show no predictive skill for the groundhog\". Groundhog Day comes from an older medieval European tradition of the Candlemas Bear, where people watched for a hibernating bear as it awoke to get a similar weather prediction. The rarity of bears in France meant that this duty eventually had to be taken over by a man in a bear costume. A similar tradition in Germany is called Dachstag ( Badger Day ), and in Ireland they use a hedgehog. Until the 17th century  Christmas  lasted almost three months, from the Feast of St Martin on 11 November to Candlemas on 2 February. Although today it doesn t officially begin until Advent (the fourth Sunday before Christmas), the shops make it seem as if it s starting earlier and earlier   a process known as  Christmas Creep . This is getting faster, and it s not just retailers. Analysis of Internet searches in 2007 found people started looking for  Santa Claus ,  elf   and  presents  on 11 November. By 2013 they started on 25 August. Ad The Third QI Book of General Ignorance, published by Faber & Faber, is on sale now",
        "target_summary": "From the captivating pages of a book inspired by the BBC's popular 'General Ignorance' round, which challenges misconceptions across history, comes a collection of 180 fascinating questions. Among them are surprising revelations about festive traditions, including these five intriguing facts that unravel common assumptions about Christmas:\n\n1.  **The Christmas Tree's Unexpected Roots:** While Prince Albert is widely credited with introducing the Christmas tree to Britain, it was actually Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, who hosted England's first documented tree display in 1800. Albert later popularized the custom, importing trees from his native Germany, where the tradition of decorating evergreens with candles dates back to the 16th century, purportedly inspired by Martin Luther. The evolution continued with artificial trees, first crafted from dyed goose feathers (a German conservation effort) and later mass-produced plastic versions by the Addis Brush Company. Ironically, a 2009 study found a plastic tree must be reused for over two decades to be more environmentally friendly than a fresh-cut one annually.\n\n2.  **\"Jingle Bells\" – A Thanksgiving Tune, Not Christmas:** This iconic carol, notably devoid of any Christmas or Nativity references, was originally titled \"The One-Horse Open Sleigh\" and composed by James Lord Pierpont in 1857 for a Thanksgiving service. Pierpont, uncle to financier J.P. Morgan, lived a colourful and tumultuous life, from whaling to the California gold rush and fighting for the Confederacy. Despite its later immense popularity, he made little money from the tune. \"Jingle Bells\" also holds the unique distinction of being the first song ever played live in space, smuggled aboard Gemini VI by astronauts Wally Schirra and Tom Stafford in 1965. Other beloved festive creations also boast surprising origins: \"Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer\" began as a 1939 colouring book character (initially \"Reginald\") by Robert May, with the famous song penned a decade later by his Jewish brother-in-law Johnny Marks, joining a tradition of Jewish songwriters behind many classic Christmas hits. Even the poignant \"Winter Wonderland\" was inspired by songwriter Dick Smith watching children play outside the sanatorium where he was dying of tuberculosis.\n\n3.  **Jesus's Name: No 'J' in Ancient Times:** The name \"Jesus\" as we know it is a product of linguistic evolution. When Jesus lived, the letter 'J' simply didn't exist. His Hebrew name was Yeshua or Yehoshua, which evolved through Greek (Iesous) and Latin (Iesus) before the 'J' consonant sound became common in English around the 17th century. Consequently, Shakespeare penned \"Romeo and Iuliet.\" Furthermore, his father's Hebrew name was Yusuf (not Joseph), making Jesus's full name likely Yeshua ben Yusuf (Joshua, son of Joseph). Their profession, often translated as \"carpenter,\" derived from the Hebrew *naggara* or Greek *tekton*, more broadly meant \"architect,\" \"stone mason,\" or \"builder,\" suggesting they might have been bricklayers rather than woodworkers.\n\n4.  **Boxing Day's Shifting Date and St. Stephen's Day:** Contrary to popular belief, Boxing Day in Britain isn't always celebrated on December 26th; it's officially defined as \"the first working day after Christmas.\" This means if Christmas falls on a weekend, Boxing Day shifts to the following Monday or even Tuesday due to bank holiday rescheduling. The holiday that *always* falls on December 26th is the Feast of St. Stephen, the patron saint of numerous things, including headaches and stone workers – a grim irony given he was the first Christian martyr to be stoned to death. Boxing Day, a tradition predominantly in Commonwealth countries, stems from the custom of giving \"Christmas boxes\" containing money or treats to workers as an annual token of appreciation.\n\n5.  **Decorations: Beyond Twelfth Night to Candlemas and Groundhog Day:** The modern superstition of taking down Christmas decorations by Twelfth Night (January 5th or 6th) is relatively new. For many centuries, decorations, often evergreen greenery, were kept up until Candlemas Eve on February 1st. Candlemas commemorates Mary and Joseph presenting baby Jesus at the Temple, and pre-Christian beliefs once held that woodland spirits inhabited the greenery, necessitating their removal and burning to prevent mischief. In North America, Candlemas has evolved into Groundhog Day, where a groundhog's emergence supposedly predicts spring's arrival, though statistics show no actual predictive skill. This tradition echoes older European customs involving hibernating bears, badgers, or even hedgehogs. This broader historical timeframe of Christmas, once stretching from November 11th to February 2nd, contrasts sharply with the contemporary phenomenon of \"Christmas Creep,\" where retailers and online search trends push the festive season to start earlier and earlier each year.",

        "content": "Drawing on a wealth of evidence by contemporary observers, such as diaries, memoirs, letters, gossip and satire, Scandalous Liaisons: Charles II and His Court recounts the king s many mistresses, including Barbara Villiers and Nell Gwyn. Here, writing for HistoryExtra, Pritchard introduces you to the pleasure-seeking world of Charles II s court  Ad Most people think of Charles II as the  merry monarch , with his perky Cockney mistress, Nell Gwyn, at the centre of a court remarkable for its gaiety, extravagance, and amorous entanglements. The poet John Dryden, always agreeable to the ruling classes, described it as a  laughing, quaffing and unthinking time , but it is clear that there was widespread disapproval of this  brave new world , as is suggested by the title of poet Samuel Butler s Satire upon the Licentious Age of Charles the Second. Samuel Pepys recorded the king dancing to a popular tune of the time,  Cuckolds All A-Row , which well suggests the cheery, heartless, amoral world of the royal court. Restoration comedies provoked uneasy laughter about adultery and cuckoldry [an act of adultery committed by a married woman against her husband]. Performances such as these reflected a preoccupation of the upper classes, where young people were married off at unsuitably early ages, in pursuit of money and estates. A wealthy young heiress was considered valuable property, to be secured by any means. On several occasions, men carried off young ladies in coaches, either to marry them or extort money from their relatives. In Charles s day, steely-eyed mothers and prospective mothers-in-law were constantly on the hunt for a bride. While Charles was a young man in France, his own mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, worked hard to find him a suitable wife: aristocratic   preferably royal   with money to support him and his indigent entourage, and to finance Charles s soldiers in England. Various German princesses were wheeled out for examination   in person or through portraiture   dismissed with Charles s favourite oath,  Ods s fish! They are all dull and foggy . Just before Charles s restoration to the throne in 1660, Cardinal Mazarin s niece, Hortense Mancini, seemed a strong contender for the role of Charles s wife, but the Cardinal ultimately decided Charles was not a good investment (though some years later Hortense became one of Charles s mistresses). While this business was going on, a series of courtiers  young wives loyally laid themselves down for their (prospective) king, with a view to present or future rewards; Charles was always generous to those who did him service, even when he could not really afford it. These young women, like most of the women in Charles s life, would have been generally dismissed as  buttered buns    that is, as women who had been recently possessed by other men, and not to be taken seriously. One such woman was the young Lucy Walter, previously mistress to Algernon Sidney in London, then to Robert Sidney in Holland, probably at the court of Mary, Princess of Orange (sister of Charles). This relationship caused great anxiety to Charles s advisers, especially Edward Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon) and his mother, who feared Charles might marry a commoner with a bad reputation. Lucy bore Charles a son, later the Duke of Monmouth. Lucy also bore another child, not by Charles, and the affair fizzled out before her early death in November 1658. Lucy was replaced, very promptly, by Mrs Barbara Palmer, better known as Barbara Villiers, later Countess Castlemaine and Duchess of Cleveland   titles earned by her own efforts in the bedroom. King Charles II's mistress Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, Countess of Castlemaine, c1660s. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Charles had many mistresses in both France and England. One of his servants, Thomas Chiffinch, used to bring them up to him via the back stairs to his room. Charles also had liaisons with many actresses: Mistress Knight, Mistress Weaver; and one, Moll Davis, was given a house; a pension of  1,000 a year; and an expensive ring. Moll s rival, Nell Gwyn, once put a powerful laxative in her competitor s food when she was due to be in bed with Charles. One woman who didn't want to sleep with Charles was the beautiful young Frances Stuart: she held on to her virginity, despite all Charles's pleadings, and eventually eloped with the Duke of Richmond   much to the king's fury. Another lady put in Charles s way was the celebrated Italian beauty and sexual adventuress, Hortense Mancini. She was  imported  by Ralph Montagu, the English ambassador to France, who was hoping to supplant Barbara Villiers [with whom the king had lost interest] and further his own career. Unfortunately for Ralph, Hortense was not interested in political manoeuvring, only in gambling and sex; her affair with Charles did not last long. A philandering brother While in France with Charles in May 1660, the king s brother, James, Duke of York, enjoying the licentious atmosphere of the court there, had an affair with Anne Hyde, the daughter of the future Earl of Clarendon, the king's chancellor. Anne went through a form of marriage with him [possibly not performed by a priest, but by verbal promises only]. By the time the couple returned to England, Anne was pregnant, and despite colourful stories accusing her of promiscuity (spread by courtiers friendly to James), James had to marry her properly [by chaplain], which wrecked his chances of marrying a wealthy foreign aristocrat or princess. As for public opinion, most people likely tended to agree with the Earl of Sandwich, who told Pepys that, among his father s many sayings [his father was the previous Earl of Sandwich] was one, that  He that gets a wench with child and marries her afterward, it was as if a man should shit in his hat and clap it on his head . Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, who became the first wife of James, Duke of York, the future King James II. She was the mother of two later queens of England, Mary II and Anne. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Anne had a difficult time at court, sneered at for being a commoner and suspected of being a social climber, but she behaved with courage and dignity. James s marriage did not hinder his continual, relentless philandering, however. A distressed Anne took to comfort eating, becoming increasingly larger, while James s energetic activities in the hunting field (and bedroom) kept him thin. One of James s early affairs was with Lady Anne Carnegie, later Countess of Southesk, who, as Anne Hamilton, had been a teenage friend of Barbara Villiers, a lady who is remembered as being one of the most notorious of Charles s many mistresses. Trying to be discreet, James apparently took the precaution of visiting the lady only formally, accompanied by a third person (who would wait in an outer room). On one occasion, the person playing gooseberry was Richard Talbot, a courtier and friend of both Charles and James. While waiting, Talbot looked out of the window, and saw a man whom he recognised coming into the house. Talbot, who had been abroad, did not know that Lord Carnegie, Lady Carnegie's husband, had been made Earl of Southesk.  Welcome, Carnegie, dear old friend! Where the devil have you been? Why are you here? Are you, too, after Lady Southesk? If so, you had better go away, for I must tell you, the Duke of York is in love with her, and is even now inside, in her chamber.  The dumbfounded earl was hustled downstairs, out of his own house and into his carriage. Talbot went back, impatient to tell the couple the amusing story of the hopeful visitor. He was very surprised that his story gave them no pleasure at all, and was only annoyed that Carnegie had changed his title to Earl of Southesk without telling him. The story does not end yet. As Pepys and others at court heard, when Southesk realised his wife was sleeping with the duke, he went to an infected whore in order to get the pox. Southesk then deliberately infected his wife, who in turn transferred it to the duke. Pepys thought this  the most pernicious and foul piece of revenge that ever [he] heard of . Whether or not the story was true, the duke did contract the pox, which he in turn transferred to his other partners. Royal mistresses Many court ladies sought the prestige of becoming a royal mistress, if only for a while. One such woman was the pretty young Margaret Brooke, who indicated her willingness to James early on, but would not go further until she was safely married. At 18, she charmed 50-year-old Sir John Denham: a tall, thin, stork-like poet and gambler, who bet against the odds by marrying her. Almost immediately Margaret became James s very public mistress. This was a situation the court wits relished, and many lampoons and vulgar verses circulated, mocking the unequal marriage and cuckolding. This was too much for Sir John, who, for a while, went mad, reportedly telling the king that he was the Holy Ghost. Margaret Brooke, Lady Denham, c1660s. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Soon after this, Margaret fell seriously ill; on her deathbed she accused Sir John of poisoning her with a chocolate drink. A post-mortem analysis was performed but, not surprisingly, no traces of poison were found. The story of poisoning was, nevertheless, widely believed. Some thought Sir John was responsible, while others blamed the Duchess of York [Anne Hyde, daughter of the Earl of Clarendon]. Let us now return to Barbara Villiers, who was recognised as the pre-eminent court beauty. Passionate, demanding, insatiable (sexually and financially), and violent-tempered, she dominated Charles and court life   poor Catherine of Braganza, brought from Portugal to be Charles s queen, stood no chance against the glamour queen of the court, (not least because Barbara was notably fecund and Catherine proved barren), screwing vast sums of money from the king, while being openly unfaithful. Barbara s many lovers included actors such as Charles Hart (Nell Gwyn s first lover); Jacob Hall, a muscular gymnast and acrobat; the court ladies   cock of the walk , Harry Jermyn; and the youthful John Churchill (later Duke of Marlborough). Barbara was generous in rewarding her lovers (with Charles s money), though the swaggering boasts of one, John Ellis, were cut short when she had him castrated. Not surprisingly, Barbara was widely hated. One ballad included the verse, Next comes Castlemaine, That prerogative quean; If I had such a bitch I would spay her; She swives like a stoat, Goes to t leg and foot, Level coil with a prince and a player.  Prerogative  suggests Barbara s arrogance, while the Oxford English Dictionary derives  level coil  from the French lever le cul, or  hitch-buttock . Barbara s overbearing behaviour, her dreadful public reputation, and the sheer expense of paying her costs and gambling debts, meant that her power and influence over the king eventually declined, and as she spent less time at court, other mistresses superseded her. Some of these mistresses were deliberately put in the king s way by court politicians hoping for indirect influence, usually in vain. One such woman was Nell Gwyn, who rose from very humble beginnings to theatre stardom. She became a long-term favourite of Charles, enjoyed not only for her sexuality but her wit, entertainment value, and good nature. c1670, English stage actress Nell Gwyn, mistress of King Charles II. She bore the king at least one illegitimate son. Original Artwork: Engraving by Walter L Colls, from an engraving by Valck after a painting by Sir Peter Lely. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) More important, emotionally, to Charles was Nell s great rival, from the opposite end of the social spectrum, Louise de K roualle. Louise was brought from the French court, and openly took part in English court politics, hoping to promote French interests. Nell constantly mocked and abused her:  Squintabella  was one nickname, for the slight cast she had in one eye, as well as  the weeping willow , for her tendency to weep when thwarted or upset. Once, when Louise had been appointed Duchess of Portsmouth (as a reward for her sexual favours) she said condescendingly to Nell, who was looking particularly fine,  Nelly, you are grown rich, I believe, by your dress; why woman you are fine enough to be a queen . Nelly riposted,  You are entirely right, madam, and I am whore enough to be a duchess.  As it was, at the end, as Charles lay on his deathbed, his thoughts were likely with both women. Louise, he said, he loved and always had, and added, according to legend,  Let not poor Nelly starve . The fact was that in Charles s later years (only in middle age, as we would understand it), his sexual appetite   and, it was widely rumoured, sexual capability   declined, so that more of his leisure time was spent sailing and fishing, while his women settled for a quieter time at court (while picking up other lovers along the way). By the end of Charles s reign, there was an increasing sense of weariness and disgust at what was seen as a degenerate court. In 1683, even one of the previously most debauched libertine courtiers, Charles Sackville, wrote a lengthy satire, or diatribe   beginning: Go on, my muse, and with bold voice proclaim The vicious lives and long detested fame Of scoundrel lords, and their lewd wives  amours, Pimp statesmen, canting priests, Court bawds and whores  The picture Sackville sketched was harsh, but not without truth. Certainly the court had devoted itself to pleasure and selfishness, superficial gaiety covering corruption. A good time was had, but it was not really a good time. The intrigues and liaisons were often regarded even then as scandalous; but perhaps, at a distance of more than 300 years, they retain some value as entertainment. Ad R E Pritchard is the author of Scandalous Liaisons: Charles II and His Court (Amberley Publishing, 2015)",
        "target_summary": "Drawing on contemporary accounts like diaries, memoirs, and satire, *Scandalous Liaisons* plunges into the pleasure-seeking world of Charles II’s court. Though often remembered as a \"merry monarch\" presiding over a court of gaiety and amorous entanglements, this vibrant façade thinly veiled widespread disapproval and a deeply amoral core. Poet John Dryden may have deemed it a \"laughing, quaffing and unthinking time,\" but critics like Samuel Butler satirized its licentiousness, and Samuel Pepys recorded the king dancing to \"Cuckolds All A-Row,\" perfectly encapsulating the era's heartless cheer. Restoration comedies, with their uneasy laughter at adultery, reflected the upper classes' preoccupation with marriages driven by financial gain rather than affection, where young heiresses were treated as valuable property, sometimes even abducted for their fortunes.\n\nCharles himself experienced this transactional approach to matrimony. While in France, his mother tirelessly sought a suitable, wealthy royal bride, but Charles dismissed various German princesses as \"dull and foggy.\" His romantic life was instead dominated by a succession of mistresses, often derided as \"buttered buns\"—women previously possessed and not to be taken seriously. Lucy Walter, an early mistress, bore him a son, the future Duke of Monmouth, but her commoner status and dubious reputation caused royal advisors immense anxiety. Lucy was swiftly succeeded by the formidable Barbara Palmer, later Countess Castlemaine and Duchess of Cleveland, whose titles were famously \"earned by her own efforts in the bedroom.\"\n\nBarbara Villiers became the pre-eminent court beauty, a passionate, financially insatiable, and violent-tempered figure who utterly dominated Charles and court life. She openly flaunted her infidelities, extracted vast sums from the king, and utterly overshadowed the barren Queen Catherine of Braganza. Despite her many lovers, from actors to future dukes, and her generous (with Charles's money) rewards, her overbearing nature, scandalous reputation, and immense expense eventually led to her decline, opening the door for others.\n\nCharles's court teemed with other captivating figures. He had liaisons with numerous actresses, showering Moll Davis with gifts, while Nell Gwyn, rising from humble beginnings, became a long-term favourite, cherished not just for her sexuality but her wit and good nature. Yet, not all succumbed to the king's charm; the beautiful Frances Stuart famously resisted his advances, eloping to his fury. Even the celebrated Italian beauty Hortense Mancini, \"imported\" to supplant Barbara, proved more interested in gambling and sex than political maneuvering, her affair brief.\n\nThe king's brother, James, Duke of York, mirrored Charles's relentless philandering. His affair with Anne Hyde, daughter of the king's chancellor, resulted in a forced, scandalous marriage after she became pregnant—a union publicly mocked, with one courtier comparing it to \"a man should shit in his hat and clap it on his head.\" Despite Anne's courageous dignity amidst snobbery, James's amorous pursuits continued unabated. This led to one of the most infamous incidents: the revenge of Lord Southesk. Realizing his wife was sleeping with the Duke, Southesk deliberately contracted syphilis from a prostitute, infected his wife, who then unknowingly passed the pox to James, a \"pernicious and foul\" act that horrified observers. Indeed, many court ladies actively sought the fleeting prestige of becoming a royal mistress, such as Margaret Brooke, whose marriage to an elderly poet was mocked before her mysterious deathbed accusation of poisoning further fueled court intrigue.\n\nIn Charles's later years, as his once-legendary appetites waned, the court's initial merriment curdled into a palpable \"weariness and disgust.\" The superficial gaiety that once masked corruption and selfishness now seemed threadbare. Even Charles Sackville, a once-notorious libertine, penned a scathing diatribe lamenting the \"vicious lives\" and \"scoundrel lords\" of a degenerate court. The text concludes that while these intrigues and liaisons were scandalous then, their brazenness and human drama still offer compelling entertainment centuries later.",

        "title": "The big questions of ancient Egypt",
        "content": "What is the earliest evidence of  art  in Egypt? The oldest graphic activity ever recorded in Egypt   indeed, in the whole of north Africa   was carved into the sandstone cliffs of Qurta around 25 miles south of Edfu, between Luxor and Aswan. Recently scientifically dated at 19,000 years old by Dr Dirk Huyge, director of the Belgian Mission who has studied the site since 2005, the gallery comprises at least 185 individual images, almost three-quarters of which depict the now-extinct, powerfully built wild cattle known as aurochs, the ancestors of domestic cows. Ad Some of these huge creatures   almost 2 metres long   have  cut  marks scratched around the head and neck area. Huyge believes that these  cuts  have some kind of symbolical meaning, possibly as an attempt to ensure a successful outcome for hunting expeditions. The Qurta scenes also feature hippos, gazelle, birds, fish and strange hybrid beings, along with several stylised female figures representing the earliest Egyptian attempts at self-portraits. Huyge has dubbed the rich repertoire of scenes a veritable  Lascaux along the Nile , observing that these lifelike and vivid images are  uncannily close  in style to European cave art such as that seen at Lascaux in France, which also features aurochs and other large animals. He adds that  perhaps direct influence or cultural exchange over such a long distance is not as improbable as it seems  The Mediterranean Sea at the time of the last Ice Age was at least 100 metres lower than it is now: could it be that Palaeolithic people established an intercontinental exchange of iconographic and symbolic concepts?  Who was the real Tutankhamun? Though undeniably Egypt s most famous pharaoh, little is known about Tutankhamun. When born, probably around 1346 BC at the city of Amarna, some 180 miles south of modern Cairo, he was named Tutankhaten    Living Image of [sun god] Aten . His father was the so-called heretic pharaoh Akhenaten, while his mother may have been Kiya, one of Akhenaten s minor wives, or possibly even Akhenaten s chief wife and co-ruler Nefertiti. Tutankhaten took the throne at his father s death in c1336 BC, changing his name to the more familiar Tutankhamun when the Aten cult was terminated and worship of the state god Amun reinstated. He ruled until his death in c1327 BC, the cause of which remains a focus of debate. Studies of Tutankhamun s tomb and its contents also continue to reveal all manner of unexpected details. Not least is the possibility that at least 80 per cent of his grave goods were originally made for other members of his family, from the famous gold throne to at least one of his three golden coffins. Even the gold death mask  had originally been a Nefertiti piece , claims Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves. Why did hieroglyphs develop? The deceptively simple-looking picture writing evolved over several millennia into a sophisticated system using thousands of signs. First described as hieroglyphs ( sacred carvings ) by the Greeks, they were largely used to create the ritual texts covering the walls of temples and tombs, while a form of hieroglyphic shorthand known as  hieratic  was used by the literate elite. These were mainly the scribes and officials who administered the country for the king, even before Egypt emerged as the world s first nation state in c3100 BC. German archaeologists excavating the tombs of Egypt s earliest rulers at Abydos in the late 1980s discovered some 150 small labels of bone, ivory and wood carved with simple pictograms    proto-hieroglyphs    describing everything from bolts of linen to jars of oil, together with their quantity and place of origin. The labels, once attached to grave goods, have been dated to c3250 BC and are the earliest evidence for the way officials raised and recorded taxes in kind. They are among the most important documents in history, as the pictograms form a phonetically readable script that some claim was the earliest writing in the world   apparently predating that of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia. When were dead bodies first mummified? Mummification is so synonymous with ancient Egypt that most people assume it has been completely understood for some time. Yet recent research is rewriting much of what was previously known   from the most effective techniques used during the 14th century BC  New Kingdom  to the preservatives that were used to obtain the most lifelike results. The origins of embalming are now known to be much earlier than the Pyramid Age (from c2600 BC). Well before that time, linen was used to wrap bodies at sites such as Mostagedda (north of Luxor), some of it coated in a toffee-like substance. But only in 2014 was this substance finally identified, by archaeological chemist Dr Stephen Buckley of the University of York, as a blend of oils, fats and antibacterial pine resin. He discovered that  some of the ingredients were brought from the north-east Mediterranean. For example, the pine resin must have come from what is now south-eastern Turkey.  But such long-distance trade links were not the only big surprise. Carbon dating carried out on the Mostagedda linen by researchers at the University of Oxford revealed that the wrappings and mixtures both date to c4300 BC   some 1,700 years earlier than mummification was previously believed to have first been used in Egypt. How many pyramids are there? It is estimated that 138 pyramids survive in Egypt, varying widely in layout, size, location and purpose. The first was built in c2650 BC for King Djoser. His bench-shaped  mastaba  tomb was embellished to form a six-tiered, 60 metre-high step pyramid. Snefru (c2613 c2589 BC), the greatest of all Egypt s pyramid builders, moved 9 million tonnes of stone to build three successive pyramids as he refined his plans, and his son Khufu created the Great Pyramid of Giza. This was the standard royal tomb till superseded in c1750 BC by rock-cut tombs such as those in Luxor s Valley of the Kings. Some smaller pyramids are believed to have served as territorial markers or tax-collecting points; these were built throughout the Nile Valley as far south as Aswan in around 2600 BC. How old was the oldest known  Egyptian ? The remains of the earliest human yet found in Egypt were discovered by Belgian archaeologists in 1994 during their excavation of a Stone Age quarry at Taramsa Hill near Dendera, about 40 miles north of Luxor. They unexpectedly uncovered the shallow pit grave of a young child. Its body was carefully buried in a seated position, oriented east toward the rising sun, with its head resting back on a sand bed to face skyward. The child, who lived during the late Pleistocene, approximately 60,000 55,000 years ago, was aged between 8 and 10 when it died, though the remains were so fragile and fragmentary that it was impossible to determine whether they were male or female. Not only is this the oldest known burial from north Africa, but it also provides a vital missing link in the human story. As the anthropologists who examined the child s remains explained:  The location of this find is significant, because it s on a possible dispersion route of modern humans from Africa into Asia and Europe between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago.  Was Cleopatra an Egyptian? Cleopatra VII  the Great  was the last pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty (305 30 BC). The Macedonian king Alexander the Great had taken Egypt in 332 BC during his conquest of the Persian empire; on his death, Ptolemy I   one of Alexander s generals and rumoured half-brother   took control. His descendants   15 male pharaohs, all called Ptolemy   shared the throne with female co-rulers. Cleopatra VII ruled first with her father, then her brothers and finally her son (by Julius Caesar) Ptolemy XV, called Caesarion. Though the Ptolemies initially spoke Greek and clung to Greek culture, they gradually became influenced by Egypt s ancient traditions. In 181 BC Ptolemy V was mummified rather than cremated, and Ptolemy VIII married one of his daughters into the Egyptian nobility. Cleopatra VII was born in Egypt, as were most of her predecessors, but was the first to learn the Egyptian language and gain the support of her subjects against the growing power of Rome. Images within Egypt s temples show her as a typical Egyptian figure with traditional regalia and long hair. However, classical-style marble portrait busts show her wavy locks swept up in a Greek-style bun. One painted image even suggests red hair. Controversy about Cleopatra s ethnicity continues to rage; the identities of her mother and grandmother are unknown   they might have been members of the Egyptian aristocracy. Are any discoveries still to be made? This is perhaps the question most often asked of Egyptologists   and the answer is a resounding yes! Some of the most exciting discoveries are being made in museums. Last year museum staff in Wigan, combining their collections in new storage facilities, rediscovered antiquities covering the entire span of Egypt s ancient history, from c3500 BC to the early centuries AD, the highlight being a gilded face from an 18th-dynasty coffin. Also last year, a re-examination of ancient linen wrappings from Mostagedda stored in Bolton Museum pushed back the origins of mummification by 1,700 years. Even the British Museum still produces surprises. In 2012, computed tomography (CT) scans revealed that the naturally mummified body of a man   known to generations of schoolchildren as  Ginger , thanks to his faded red hair   had literally been stabbed in the back around 3500 BC. In Egypt itself, of course, new finds are announced almost every week. Even the Valley of the Kings has not yet been completely explored. Nor, it seems, has its most famous tomb. In 2014, high-resolution scans of the walls of Tutankhamun s burial chamber revealed the outlines of two intact sealed doorways. Some experts believe these may lead to additional unexplored chambers. So, much like the iconic golden death mask, even the tomb of Tutankhamun still conceals secrets. Joann Fletcher is honorary visiting professor at the University of York.

Intriguingly, analyses suggest up to 80% of his opulent grave goods, including his iconic death mask, were originally crafted for other family members.\n\nThe development of hieroglyphs, those deceptively simple \"sacred carvings,\" reveals an astonishing evolutionary journey. Far from being merely ritualistic, early proto-hieroglyphs from around 3250 BC served practical administrative purposes, recording taxes and trade. Some scholars even contend these meticulously carved labels represent the world's earliest phonetically readable script, potentially predating Sumerian writing.\n\nPerhaps most surprising are the origins of mummification, now known to be vastly older than once thought. Recent research has pushed its beginnings back by 1,700 years to approximately 4300 BC. Early mummies from sites like Mostagedda were preserved with a complex blend of oils, fats, and antibacterial pine resin, sourced from as far away as southeastern Turkey, highlighting extensive ancient trade networks.\n\nEgypt's monumental pyramids, 138 of which still stand, illustrate a remarkable architectural progression. Beginning with King Djoser's innovative Step Pyramid around 2650 BC, these colossal structures culminated in Khufu's Great Pyramid of Giza. Beyond grand royal tombs, smaller pyramids also served as territorial markers or tax collection points across the Nile Valley.\n\nThe human story in Egypt reaches back even further. The oldest human remains, a child buried 60,000 to 55,000 years ago near Dendera, were unearthed in 1994. This carefully interred individual, facing the rising sun, offers a crucial link in understanding the dispersal of early modern humans from Africa into other continents.\n\nCleopatra VII, the last formidable pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty, presided over a fascinating cultural intersection. Descending from Alexander the Great's Macedonian general, she was born in Egypt and uniquely embraced its ancient language and traditions to gain her subjects' support against the encroaching power of Rome. While depicted with traditional Egyptian regalia, her true ethnicity remains a vibrant topic of debate.\n\nRemarkably, ancient Egypt continues to unveil its secrets. Ongoing excavations across its timeless landscapes, alongside fresh examinations of artifacts in museums worldwide, consistently yield profound insights. From revealing that the British Museum's \"Ginger\" mummy was stabbed around 3500 BC to recent scans hinting at unexplored chambers within Tutankhamun's famed tomb, the sands of Egypt, and the treasures within its collections, promise many more captivating discoveries to come.",

        "content": "Born: 27 January 1859 in the Crown Prince s Palace, Berlin, Prussia Ad Died: 4 June 1941 in Doorn, Netherlands Remembered for: Being the last German kaiser and king of Prussia, and one of the most prominent figures of the First World War. Ruled: 1888 1918 Family: Wilhelm s father was Frederick III, who was briefly the kaiser of Germany and king of Prussia (Wilhelm s grandfather, Wilhelm I, ruled between January 1871 March 1888). His mother was Victoria, the eldest daughter of British Queen Victoria. In 1881 Wilhelm married his second cousin, Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, with whom he had seven children. Augusta died in 1921, and the following year Wilhelm married Hermine Reuss of Greiz. His life: Wilhelm was born in 1859. It was a difficult birth, during which Wilhelm sustained nerve damage that left one of his arms permanently paralysed   a condition that he attempted to conceal throughout his life.  Treatments  to which Wilhelm was subjected during his childhood included electrotherapy and having a dead hare wrapped around his arm. It was thought that these may  cure  him of his condition. In 1874 he began his schooling at the Kassel Gymnasium, and in 1877 he went on to attend the University of Bonn for four terms, where he studied politics and law. To mark his 18th birthday, Wilhelm was invested with the Order of the Garter by his grandmother, Queen Victoria, of whom he was extremely fond. On 15 June 1888 Wilhelm s father died of cancer of the larynx, having ruled for just 99 days. At 29 years old, Wilhelm became emperor of Germany. During his rule, Wilhelm was determined to expand Germany s power. He set out to improve the country s economy and create a naval force that could rival that of the British Royal Navy, which was one of the leading naval fleets in the world.

(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) In 1890 Wilhelm forced the chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, to resign and he took control of Germany s foreign and domestic policies. Throughout his reign, Wilhelm encouraged the development of the arts and sciences, and was determined to improve Germany s social welfare and the standards of its schools. In 1911 he established the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, which became a prominent centre for scientific research. In 1896 Wilhelm antagonised Britain when he congratulated Paul Kruger, president of the South African Republic, on his success in defeating the British troops that had attempted to raid a South African territory. Tensions were further heightened in 1908 when Wilhelm, in an interview in The Daily Telegraph, suggested that a proportion of the German population was  anti-English . Around this time his relationship with his extended family deteriorated. He reputedly resented his uncle, King Edward VII, and his relationship with his cousin, Tsar Nicholas II, also became strained. After a Serbian rebel assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary on 28 June 1914, Wilhelm encouraged Austria-Hungary to retaliate against Serbia. But, as countries across Europe became embroiled in the First World War, German military generals excluded Wilhelm from key decisions and he became merely a figurehead for the German army. After the US joined the war in 1917, the Allied Powers (including Britain) began to make significant gains. After years of continuous fighting, by 1918 Germany was experiencing serious shortages of troops and ammunition. In 1918 rumours spread that Germany was planning to surrender to the Allies, and questions began to circulate about Wilhelm s position in power. On 9 November 1918, the German chancellor Prince Max von Baden preempted Wilhelm s abdication and proclaimed publicly that Wilhelm had surrendered his powers. Wilhelm subsequently consented and officially abdicated his throne, fleeing to the Netherlands. After the armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, officially ending the war, the Allies attempted to force the Dutch government to extradite Wilhelm, to be tried as a war criminal. The Dutch government refused, instead allowing him to remain in exile in the Netherlands. While in exile, Wilhelm wrote two memoirs: Memoirs, 1878 1918 (1922) and My Early Life (1926). With the rise of the Nazi party in Germany in the early 1930s, rumours spread that Wilhelm might be invited back to Germany to retake his throne, but these proved unfounded. He lived out the remainder of his life in the Dutch countryside. Ad On 4 June 1941 Wilhelm died of a pulmonary embolism in Doorn, aged 82.",
        "target_summary": "Born in Berlin in 1859, Wilhelm II became the last German Kaiser and King of Prussia, a pivotal figure who reigned from 1888 to 1918 and profoundly influenced the tumultuous era of the First World War. His early life began with adversity; a difficult birth left him with a permanently paralysed arm, a condition he diligently sought to hide throughout his life, enduring unusual childhood treatments.\n\nSon of Emperor Frederick III and Victoria, Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Wilhelm was deeply connected to Europe's royal lineage. After his father's brief 99-day reign, Wilhelm ascended to the throne at 29. He was fiercely determined to elevate Germany's global standing, investing heavily in its economy, fostering scientific and artistic development (founding the Kaiser Wilhelm Society), and building a formidable naval force to challenge Britain's supremacy. Asserting his authority, he famously dismissed Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1890, taking direct control of both domestic and foreign policies.\n\nHowever, his reign was marked by growing international tensions. He frequently antagonized Britain through actions like the Kruger telegram and controversial interviews, further straining already fraught relationships with relatives like his uncle, King Edward VII, and cousin, Tsar Nicholas II. His fateful encouragement of Austria-Hungary's retaliation following Archduke Franz Ferdinand's assassination in 1914 plunged Europe into the Great War. Yet, as the conflict escalated, Wilhelm was increasingly sidelined by his military generals, relegated to a mere figurehead while Germany endured years of brutal fighting.\n\nBy 1918, facing imminent defeat and widespread unrest, his position became untenable. His abdication was preempted by his chancellor, leading Wilhelm to officially relinquish his throne and seek exile in the Netherlands. Despite Allied attempts to prosecute him as a war criminal, the Dutch government refused extradition. Wilhelm spent his remaining decades in quiet exile, penning memoirs and witnessing the rise of Nazism from afar, though rumours of his return to power proved unfounded. He passed away on June 4, 1941, in Doorn, at the age of 82, a poignant end to a life that had embodied both the ambitions and the ultimate downfall of imperial Germany.",

        "content": "When faced with death, the Byzantine emperor Justinian was a cowardly figure. The same could not be said of his wife, Theodora. Ad During a revolt in Constantinople in the year 532, Justinian was ready to make a run for it, but the audacious empress implored him to stay to save his reign. She arose from her throne and uttered the phrase  If you wish to save yourself, my lord, there is no difficulty  As for me, I agree with the saying that royal purple is the noblest shroud . But Theodora had not always been so majestic. Born in the hippodrome to a bear keeper and actress, she came from the lowest rung of society. Nonetheless, Theodora s involvement with politics began at a young age. Theodora s involvement with politics began at a young age Her family were members of the Green faction, supporters of the corresponding Green hippodrome team, whose followers from the working classes possessed a degree of political influence. Their rivals were the Blues, a team backed by the upper and ruling classes, who also held considerable political leverage. Her father died when she was young, so Theodora s mother quickly remarried in order to avoid destitution. She attempted to get her new husband into the vacant bear-baiting position by parading her downtrodden children in front of the Greens. However, her emotional appeal was ridiculed and laughed at. Sensing an opportunity to steal support from their rivals, the Blues gave Theodora s stepfather a job, saving the family from poverty. From this moment, Theodora s loyalty remained with the Blues, a switch that would define her destiny. Shunned by society As she grew up, Theodora took to the stage to earn money. Her childhood was spent performing circus tricks with her sister, and as she blossomed into a teenager, she moved onto more risqu  performances. Soon, Theodora was known throughout the Empire for her interpretation of Leda and the Swan, the infamous Ancient Greek myth of Zeus turning himself into a swan to sleep with a young woman. Theodora provided a colourful version of the story by scattering grain on her nether regions and encouraging geese to peck it from her. Off stage, wealthier clients would pay for her sexual services, and though it provided a source of income, it meant she was shunned by society. Wealthier clients would pay for her sexual services, and though it provided a source of income, it meant she was shunned by society. At the tender age of 16, Theodora believed she d found an escape from her former life when she journeyed with civil servant Hecebolus to his new posting in Libya. Here she lived as his mistress for four years, but he abused her and eventually threw her out onto the streets, penniless. Her determination saw her through, and she scraped together enough money to get herself and her infant daughter to Alexandria. She encountered two influential religious leaders, who identified as Monophysite Christians. These so-called  heretics  stood at loggerheads to the mainstream Orthodox Church, as they believed that Jesus never had a mortal form, and was an entirely divine being. Theodora s interactions with them moved her so much that she converted, and remained steadfastly committed to Monophysitism. Back to Constantinople Theodora s luck began to change when she befriended Macedonia, a dancer and member of the Blue faction. With her help, Theodora was able to return to Constantinople, and even land a respectable job as a wool-spinner. Macedonia also introduced Theodora to future emperor Justinian, a valuable Blue ally. He was instantly infatuated with her beauty and wit, and desired to make her his wife as soon as possible. However, Theodora s past haunted her, and an old Roman law prevented high society from marrying former actresses. Justinian took advantage of his elderly uncle the Emperor in AD 525, and changed the law to let  truly repentant  actresses wed those of high rank. They married almost immediately. Two years later, Justinian and Theodora sat as rulers of the mighty Eastern Roman Empire. Theodora proved her worth during the Nika riots of 532. A fight between the Blues and Greens at the hippodrome culminated in a violent uprising, in which the teams both attempted to overthrow the dynasty and proclaim the unwitting commander Hypatius as emperor. Theodora was ruthless. After convincing her husband to remain in the city and face the rioters, they sent loyal soldiers to the place where she grew up. The exits were sealed off, and in the massacre that ensued, 30,000 people were slaughtered. Hypatius was brought to the palace, and though Justinian was willing to spare the rioters  figurehead, Theodora wanted to make an example of him, and he was promptly executed. What were the Nika Riots? The most violent riots in the history of Constantinople, and all because of chariot racing A week of rioting in January AD 532 ended with Constantinople wrecked, tens of thousands dead, and Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I almost overthrown. The Romans took chariot racing very seriously. Chariot teams were split into colour-coded factions   Blue, Green, Red and White   with loyal groups of supporters, called demes. Violence among them was common enough at races in the Hippodrome (like football hooliganism today), but after one particularly bloody fight Justinian set an example by executing the ringleaders. Job done, except two escaped   one Blue and one Green   and sought sanctuary in a church, which inadvertently united the demes against the emperor. With tension mounting, the next race turned even uglier than normal. All factions took up the cry Nika ( Win  or  Victory ) against Justinian and poured into the streets for a full week of rioting, during which the mob declared a new emperor and the original Hagia Sophia fell victim to the flames. Order was only restored when Justinian sent in his troops to trap the demes in the Hippodrome and cut them down in the thousands. In the aftermath, the royal couple set about restoring the stability of the Byzantine world. Theodora s work as empress was characterised by an increase in women s rights and religious tolerance. She fought for laws that banned pimps, proscribed the death penalty for rape, and gave mothers custody rights over children. She also ensured religious protection for Monophysites within the palace walls, even though Justinian himself was Orthodox. Theodora died at age 48, probably of breast cancer. In her memory, Justinian continued to protect Monophysites throughout the Empire, despite his personal beliefs. The couple s mark on Constantinople is still visible today at Hagia Sophia, the breathtaking church they built together after the Nika revolts   a lavish display of their wealth and influence over the Empire.

        "target_summary": "Empress Theodora of Byzantium emerged as a figure of formidable will, a striking contrast to her often-hesitant husband, Emperor Justinian. During the catastrophic Nika Revolt of 532, as Justinian contemplated abandoning his throne, it was Theodora’s stirring declaration – \"royal purple is the noblest shroud\" – that galvanized him to stay and fight, ultimately saving his reign.\n\nHer extraordinary ascent began at the very lowest rung of society. Born in Constantinople's hippodrome, the daughter of a bear-keeper and an actress, she was initially aligned with the working-class Green faction. After her father's death, a rejected plea for employment from the Greens ironically led the rival, aristocratic Blues to offer her stepfather a job, cementing young Theodora's loyalty to them – a pivotal shift that would define her destiny.\n\nAs she matured, Theodora embraced the stage, first performing circus tricks before moving onto more provocative acts, achieving notoriety for her explicit interpretation of \"Leda and the Swan.\" Off-stage, she provided sexual services, an existence that brought income but also social ostracization. At sixteen, seeking escape, she journeyed to Libya as mistress to a civil servant, only to be abused and abandoned. Resourceful and determined, she scraped her way to Alexandria with her infant daughter, where she embraced Monophysite Christianity, a \"heretical\" sect that would remain central to her faith.\n\nHer fortunes changed upon returning to Constantinople, befriended by a Blue faction dancer named Macedonia, who helped her secure a respectable job and, crucially, introduced her to Justinian. He was instantly captivated by her intellect and beauty. Despite an archaic law prohibiting high-ranking individuals from marrying former actresses, Justinian, deeply smitten, manipulated his elderly uncle, the Emperor, to amend the legislation, allowing \"truly repentant\" actresses to marry into the elite. They married swiftly, ascending to rule the mighty Eastern Roman Empire two years later.\n\nThe Nika Riots provided Theodora with a brutal canvas to display her resolve. This violent uprising, ignited by rival chariot racing factions and fueled by the execution of ringleaders, sought to overthrow the imperial dynasty. It was Theodora who steeled Justinian's nerve, then orchestrated the ruthless suppression of the revolt. Loyal troops were dispatched to the Hippodrome, where, with exits sealed, an estimated 30,000 people were slaughtered. She further demonstrated her unwavering will by insisting on the execution of Hypatius, the rioters' figurehead, against Justinian's more lenient inclinations.\n\nIn the aftermath, Theodora proved a visionary empress, leaving an indelible mark on Byzantine society. She championed women's rights, enacting laws against pimps, establishing the death penalty for rape, and granting mothers custody of their children. Demonstrating remarkable religious tolerance, she protected Monophysite Christians within the palace walls, even though her husband adhered to Orthodox beliefs. Her life ended at 48, likely from breast cancer, but her legacy endured. Justinian, in her memory, continued her protective policies towards Monophysites. The magnificent Hagia Sophia, rebuilt after the riots, stands today as a breathtaking testament to their shared power and vision over the Empire.",

        "content": "Recounting tales from 1,000 years of British history, Secrets of Great British Castles captures the might and majesty of Edinburgh, Cardiff, York, Lancaster, Leeds and Arundel castles and brings to life the heroic and notorious characters who once walked their corridors. Ad Here, writing for History Extra, Jones explores their hidden history  Edinburgh Castle Edinburgh Castle is one of Britain s most famous landmarks, which is why millions of people walk up the Royal Mile to visit it every year. Built on a volcanic crag above the city the castle looks out to the Firth of Forth; walking around its sprawling courtyards and rooms is a journey through nearly 1,000 years of Scottish history. Probably the most notorious event in Edinburgh Castle s history is the Black Dinner, which took place in 1440 during the minority of King James II of Scotland. The Earl of Douglas, himself little more than a boy, was invited to dine at the castle, but at a pre-arranged moment a black bull s head was carried out on a platter: it was the signal for Douglas and his brother to be wrestled from the table, dragged outside and murdered. The story has gained several layers of salacious detail in its many retellings down the years, and most recently it became, in mutated form, the Red Wedding in the fantasy television series Game of Thrones. In that version, the Starks are  well, if you ve seen Game of Thrones, you ll remember. No spoilers, as they say! There s so much history to absorb in Edinburgh that it is almost overwhelming. The castle is wound into the life of Mary, Queen of Scots, her son James VI and I and the epic, long-running inter-family feud between the Tudor and Stuart dynasties, which took place during the 16th century. It is also home to the Scottish crown jewels and a healthy array of heavy artillery including the One O Clock Gun, which sounds the time for shipping in the Firth of Forth. But perhaps my favourite building of all is a simple but beautiful chapel dedicated to St Margaret. It was built around 1130 and is reputed to be the oldest building in Scotland. Cardiff Castle Cardiff Castle is very dear to my heart, as I ve spent many happy hours drinking in the shadow of its great gates, in the Goat Major pub on High Street. It s rather different in character and scale to many of the more famous Welsh castles of Snowdonia, not least because unlike Caernarfon, Conwy, Beaumaris and its other northern cousins, Cardiff Castle has spent much of its life as a fortified home rather than simply a military garrison. The keep in the centre of the castle grounds dates to Norman times, and Cardiff had one very illustrious Norman occupant: William the Conqueror s eldest son, Robert Curthose, who was imprisoned there for more than a decade by his younger brother, Henry I of England. Curthose eventually died in prison at a grand old age, but he left behind his maudlin reflections on life in jail. One poem in Welsh is associated with Curthose:  woe to him who is not old enough to die,  it reads. The most eye-catching parts of the castle today are the rooms created by the architect William Burges on behalf of Cardiff s super-wealthy 19th-century owner, John Crichton-Stuart, the 3rd Marquess of Bute. The marquess s vast industrial wealth combined with Burges  genius for neo-gothic interior design produced a range of exotic and extraordinarily lavish rooms, lending a cod-medieval sensibility to high aristocratic living. Dan Jones outside Cardiff Castle. (Channel 5 Productions) York Castle York Castle is mostly ruined now, and locals call the keep that remains on its mound Clifford s Tower, after the family who became hereditary constables in the late 16th century. Unusually, the tower is clover-shaped and you can still climb up its slippery stone staircases to explore rooms dating to York Castle s Plantagenet-era glory days. So much of York s unique, rich and sometimes very dark history can be linked to Clifford s Tower. The castle originated with William the Conqueror, who put two fortresses by the River Ouse as he attempted to subject the Viking-influenced north to his rule. In 1190 it was the scene of a terrible pogrom, which wiped out the city s entire Jewish population at the hands of a rioting mob inflamed by the crusading fervour of the day. In the early 14th century it was used to house Templar prisoners as they awaited trial following the dissolution of the order under Edward II. When the north rose in protest at Henry VIII s dissolution of the monasteries, York castle was again at the heart of the action. Robert Aske, a lawyer who led the protests, was taken as a prisoner from London to York and hanged in chains from the castle walls. Rather later, another famous prisoner died after being imprisoned in the cells of the jail across the road from Clifford s Tower. He was Richard Turpin, an Essex horse-thief now immortalised in the legend of Dick Turpin and his wonder-horse, Black Bess. Today you can sit in Turpin s (supposed) cell. Fortunately, they let you out! The remains of York Castle. (  Kevintate/Dreamstime.com) Lancaster Castle Lancaster Castle was, until 2011, a working prison, and there were few eerier moments filming the new series than walking around the abandoned cells attached to the old medieval fortress. The Birmingham Six were held there during their notorious trial in 1975, which also took place at Lancaster Castle, in the crown court that is still in operation there. The  Birmingham Six  were six Irishmen resident in Birmingham who were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for two pub bombings in the city that killed 21 people. Their convictions were later quashed and they were released after serving nearly 17 years in jail. Having functioned as a court, a prison and a centre of royal justice, Lancaster Castle is a window into 800 years of crime and punishment. Fittingly, it was once a possession of King John, the Plantagenet king who was a keen student of the law in his own right and who was forced in 1215 to agree to Magna Carta, a document revered today as a pillar of British constitutional principles. One of the most notorious cases to have been heard at Lancaster was that of the so-called  Pendle Witches , eight women and two men from nearby villages who were accused of summoning demons and cursing their neighbours. They were almost all convicted at the court on the evidence of a disturbed nine-year old girl named Jennet Device and were taken to be strung up on nearby Gallows Hill, as were so many of Lancaster s other convicts over the centuries. Some convicts, however, were spared the noose and instead sent to the transportation hulks in the south of England, which took them on to a term of penal servitude in far-flung places like Australia. Making the new series we met the descendent of a sheep-rustler sentenced to exactly this fate   in a delicious irony, she is now a successful criminal prosecutor  down under . Lancaster Castle. (  Steve Allen/Dreamstime.com) Leeds Castle Described as  the loveliest castle in the world , Leeds Castle has hosted everything from Plantagenet banquets to G8 summits. It is in an undeniably stunning location not far from Maidstone in Kent. (Don t go to Leeds in Yorkshire: you ll be hunting a long time for their castle!) Leeds once had a close association with Eleanor of Castile, first wife of Edward I  Longshanks . Eleanor was a successful property magnate and she transformed Leeds Castle, making improvements that included erecting the central building known as the Gloriette and installing a bathhouse, the remains of which have recently been investigated by archaeologists digging in a drained section of the moat. In 1520, Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon stopped at Leeds Castle on their way to the Field of the Cloth of Gold in northern France, an event which is commemorated in a painting that is replicated in the castle today: the  Embarkation from Dover . You can also spot Catherine s personal symbol, the pomegranate, carved into the castle s fireplaces. Much of the stately splendour of Leeds today is the work of Olive, Lady Baillie, an American heiress who purchased the castle in the 1920s and renovated its interiors over many decades. The castle became the venue for parties with guests including European royalty, American films stars and leading British politicians. But Lady Baillie was a philanthropist as well as a hostess; she turned the castle into a hospital in the Second World War and left it in trust when she died so that it could be enjoyed after she was gone. Leeds Castle, Kent. (  Emanuele Leoni/ Dreamstime.com) Arundel Castle Arundel Castle is today someone s house, and I almost felt rude pitching up there this summer to nose around. It is the seat of the Duke of Norfolk, England s first peer, and it has been home to his family for centuries. The Fitzalan-Howards (earls of Arundel as well as dukes of Norfolk) have a family story that ranges from medieval war to 17th-century art collection. Arundel Castle is a superb showcase for their particular rich slice of British history. There has been a castle at Arundel since William the Conqueror gave this swathe of southern England to his friend and supporter Roger de Montgomery in 1067/68. During the 12th-century  Anarchy  (the civil war between King Stephen and his cousin Empress Matilda) there was a stand-off here that nearly ended in Matilda s capture. Royal connections have continued ever since. During the 14th century Arundel was home to Richard Fitzalan, a friend, comrade and financier to the great Edward III, who made a fortune out of funding and fighting the Hundred Years  War. Suits of armour adorning Arundel s walls still speak to those medieval glory years. Arundel Castle. (  Areinwald/Dreamstime.com) The art of Arundel castle tells the story of another great era, when the 17th-century  collector earl , Thomas Howard, toured Europe cherry-picking artefacts and sending them home to England. Many of the marble statues he collected can now be seen in Oxford s Ashmolean Museum, but Arundel Castle is fairly heaving with works by the painters he patronised, among them Anthony van Dyck and Daniel Mytens.Almost as grand as Arundel s huge buildings are its extraordinary gardens, but my favourite spot is the cricket pitch on the other side of the pretty little town. There aren t many more picturesque grounds in England, maybe even the world. Not a bad back garden, I guess.

From formidable fortresses to lavish aristocratic homes, these architectural marvels stand as enduring testaments to the nation's turbulent past.\n\n**Edinburgh Castle**, perched majestically on a volcanic crag, dominates Scotland's capital, drawing millions to its sprawling courtyards. This iconic fortress breathes a millennium of Scottish lore, from the notorious 1440 \"Black Dinner\"—a brutal murder inspiring *Game of Thrones*' \"Red Wedding\"—to its intimate connections with Mary, Queen of Scots, and the epic Tudor-Stuart dynastic feuds. Beyond housing the resplendent Scottish crown jewels and powerful artillery like the One O'Clock Gun, it treasures the humble yet beautiful St Margaret's Chapel, reputedly Scotland's oldest building, dating back to 1130.\n\n**Cardiff Castle** offers a distinct character, having largely served as a fortified home rather than a purely military garrison. Its robust Norman keep once imprisoned William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose, for over a decade. However, its most visually striking elements today are the extraordinary Victorian Gothic interiors. Commissioned by the immensely wealthy 3rd Marquess of Bute and brought to life by architect William Burges, these lavish, exotic rooms blend neo-Gothic genius with aristocratic grandeur, creating a unique, fantastical sensibility.\n\nThe evocative ruins of **York Castle** are primarily embodied by Clifford's Tower, a distinctive clover-shaped keep tracing its origins to William the Conqueror's strategic fortresses. This historic site holds a profoundly dark and rich past, notably witnessing a horrific pogrom against the city's Jewish population in 1190. Later, it confined Templar prisoners and oversaw the execution of Robert Aske, a leader of the Pilgrimage of Grace, from its walls. Its shadow also falls upon the legendary highwayman Dick Turpin, who was imprisoned in nearby cells, adding another layer to its storied legacy of justice and infamy.\n\n**Lancaster Castle**, until recently a working prison, provides a stark window into 800 years of crime and punishment. Its austere walls and enduring courtrooms have hosted pivotal legal dramas, including the infamous 1975 trial of the \"Birmingham Six.\" Historically a possession of King John, a monarch intimately tied to the Magna Carta, it also bore witness to the chilling trials of the \"Pendle Witches\"—a tragic case where eight women and two men were condemned and executed, mirroring the grim fate of countless others sent to the gallows or transported to distant penal colonies.\n\nOften hailed as \"the loveliest castle in the world,\" **Leeds Castle**, nestled amidst Kent's stunning landscape, boasts a glorious and diverse history. It was profoundly shaped by Eleanor of Castile, Edward I's queen, who dramatically transformed it with additions like the central Gloriette and luxurious bathhouses. Centuries later, it hosted Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon en route to the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Its modern splendor, however, owes much to Olive, Lady Baillie, an American heiress who, from the 1920s, meticulously renovated its interiors, turning it into a venue for grand parties and a wartime hospital, ultimately preserving it in trust for public enjoyment.\n\nFinally, **Arundel Castle** stands as the ancient, living seat of England's premier peer, the Duke of Norfolk, steeped in centuries of the Fitzalan-Howard family's illustrious history. Granted by William the Conqueror, this formidable fortress has witnessed pivotal moments, from a near capture of Empress Matilda during the 12th-century \"Anarchy\" to serving as financier Richard Fitzalan's base during the Hundred Years' War. Its walls still echo with medieval glory and a remarkable artistic heritage, notably showcasing works by Van Dyck and Daniel Mytens from the 17th-century 'collector earl,' Thomas Howard.

        "content": "Over the summer, a team of researchers from the Hidden Abbey Project carried out ground-penetrating radar (GPR) research of the Reading Abbey area   the final resting place of Henry I and his wife, Adeliza. The first phase of the project aims to uncover the full extent of the abbey church, which was largely destroyed in 1539 during the dissolution of the monasteries. Initial results from the radar scan show three potential graves, possibly including that of Henry I. Ad It has already been established that Henry was buried in front of the high altar, with members of his family buried in specific locations around him. If the team can successfully locate the high altar, they will be able to determine the likely burial location of Henry I. Digging work is due to begin in the car park in the autumn, and the project s findings will feature in a planned television documentary with Darlow Smithson Productions. Henry I, the youngest of William the Conqueror s four sons, founded Reading Abbey in 1121 as a royal mausoleum, and is buried there along with his second wife, Adeliza, and great-grandson William of Poitiers. We caught up with Philippa Langley, who instigated the Hidden Abbey Project for Reading, to find out more  Q: What can you tell us about the graves that have been discovered? A: The ground-penetrating radar survey has uncovered the eastern end of the medieval abbey church beneath what is now the Ministry of Justice car park. The chancel, apse and ambulatory areas are shown in quite stunning detail. Three potential grave slots are also marked in this location. Two are positioned beside each other towards the eastern wall of the apse with the third slightly further west, with half of it seemingly under the dividing wall with the playground of the adjacent nursery school. The walls of the nave and far western extent of the abbey church are, at this stage, proving more difficult to locate, possibly due to higher soil levels in the Forbury Gardens or having been robbed. Q: Can you speculate as to who the graves might belong to? What would you say are the chances of one of them belonging to Henry I? A: It might be possible to speculate who the graves belong to when we can determine the location of the high altar. The location of the high altar is one of the Hidden Abbey Project s key research questions and will be a hugely significant discovery in terms of understanding this potentially unique Romanesque building. It is currently believed that the high altar is located in the choir of the church, which would place the grave of Henry I further west under the nursery school building. Recently, the eastern playground of the nursery has also been suggested, and either of these locations might be correct. This is because we know that Henry was buried in front of the high altar. However, if the original (Norman) high altar is located against the eastern wall of the apse, as seen for example at Tewkesbury Abbey, then one of the two graves positioned side by side in the car park could be Henry. The other might then be Constance of York (1374 1416), who was buried near Henry, and is also believed to have been placed before the altar. The positioning of the high altar against the eastern wall of Tewkesbury Abbey could be a potential pointer for Reading, as Tewkesbury is a direct contemporary, being consecrated in 1121, the same year Reading Abbey was founded. Tewkesbury was also financed by Henry I s illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester. However, until we can place a targeted trench in the Ministry of Justice car park to uncover and fully understand the east end of the Norman abbey church, and potentially locate its high altar, we have only these various hypotheses to go on. In essence, if the Hidden Abbey Project is successful in locating the high altar of the abbey, this will then give us the key not only to understanding the abbey church and potentially its wider abbey precinct, but also to determining the burial location of King Henry I of England. Whatever the authorities involved decide to do with this information, the question then remains whether Henry s grave is there or was removed by later development work and/or desecrated in the mid-16th century. Grave desecration seems unlikely at this stage given the religious times it was said to have taken place, and to have been carried out by Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, uncle of the then reigning monarch, Edward VI. If Seymour had received royal orders to desecrate a royal tomb, this would have set an extraordinary precedent. Or did Seymour simply decide in the zeal of the final destruction of the abbey s east end that greed was good? If the medieval king had been buried in a silver casket, Seymour wanted to know. At this point of course, grave desecration is all conjectural. However, what we do know is the church today takes grave desecration very seriously indeed, so determining whether this actually took place is a significant question.

How do we go about determining a possible connection to Henry I? Is an excavation likely to take place at some point in the future? A: Digging work is due to begin in the car park in the autumn. The Ministry of Justice had previously received permission from Historic England to dig two trenches in the car park based on a Desk Based Assessment (DBA). However, with the Hidden Abbey Project now supplying the GPR analysis and locating the entire east end of the abbey church in the car park at its southern end, the archaeologists and Historic England are now in a position to plan targeted trenches in order to answer the project s (and Reading s) many key research questions. And uncovering the east end of the abbey church will be the basis to unlocking its story. As to a possible connection to Henry, if we uncover the high altar we will then be able to extrapolate the likely location of the king s grave. And by bringing his story to life in the documentary, Henry I will no longer be our forgotten king. If Henry s grave is discovered, it will then be for Reading Council, the landowner [the Ministry of Justice or Diocese of Portsmouth] and Historic England to decide what happens next. Q: What is your reaction to the discovery? A: I m very excited for Reading. The discovery of the east end of the abbey church beneath the car park is an important moment for the town s history, giving them the opportunity to answer so many of the project s key research questions. Telling the abbey s story is going to be incredibly important for Reading, enabling it to become, what I believe it should have always been   a historic town. Q: What parallels can be drawn with the 2012/13 search for the remains of Richard III in Leicester? A: There are some interesting parallels with the search for Richard III in Leicester. Clearly we have the graves of two kings of England becoming lost over time, and two modern locations being a car park and adjacent school. And we also have stories about grave desecration. Before the Looking For Richard Project began its research, it was widely believed (and stated as fact by many leading historians as well as locally in Leicester) that Richard s remains had been removed at the time of the dissolution and thrown in the river Soar. However, what we must also take into account is that unlike Leicester, Reading Abbey is a Scheduled Ancient Monument site under the auspices of Historic England. So far, Historic England has made it clear that it is focused on the site coming off its endangered list and, at the highest level, has recognised what the Hidden Abbey Project can do for Reading. With the GPR survey results now submitted, and in fully supporting Reading by giving it the opportunity to reveal its extraordinary story in full for the first time by placing clearly defined and targeted trenches in the car park, Historic England is on the cusp of offering this Thames Valley town, and its people, an exciting new future.

A central mystery revolves around precisely locating the high altar, as historical records confirm Henry I was buried directly in front of it. Depending on whether the original Norman high altar was positioned against the eastern wall of the apse (a configuration seen in contemporary abbeys like Tewkesbury) or further west in the choir, Henry’s elusive grave could be situated within the car park or even under an adjacent nursery school building.

        "title": "Did Eustace Chapuys really despise Anne Boleyn?",
        "content": "Considering the ambassador s many reports, which have been instrumental in shaping modern interpretations of Henry VIII and his wives, historian Lauren Mackay reevaluates what we think we know about one of the most controversial figures at the Tudor court. Ad Mackay reveals how, rather than celebrating Anne Boleyn's downfall, as is often believed, Chapuys in fact publicly declared in 1536 that she was innocent of the charges brought against her. Here, writing for HistoryExtra, Mackay considers why Chapuys  presence in Anne Boleyn s life has been given a more sinister aspect than it deserves   Full of vexation come I, with complaint . So declares Hermia s father in Shakespeare s A Midsummer Night s Dream. It is the cry of the historian too when certain historical figures are, in our view, consistently misrepresented. Our passions are ignited and we make ready to defend. History has certainly judged the players in Henry VIII s court, particularly its queens, which it enjoyed to excess. Like a good piece of theatre, every character engages our interest, and like any masterly drama, there are victims and villains. Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII s second wife, may claim both titles as she continues to provoke debate as to her role in the compelling drama that witnessed her glorious rise and her calamitous fall. So too does Eustace Chapuys, whose chronicles over 15 years as Charles V s imperial ambassador give us much of the colour and detail of the period. Anne Boleyn was the woman Henry just had to have. His determination would wreak discord in his kingdom and for her he would forsake a wife and a daughter, resulting in much heartache and, for some, death. In the royal courts of Europe Anne was branded a concubine or whore, and was  the scandal of Christendom,  according to Catherine of Aragon. But the supremely confident and obsessed Henry would wed Anne and make her his queen   all she had to do was to fulfill her end of the bargain: bear Henry a son. Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of King Henry VIII, who branded Anne Boleyn  the scandal of Christendom,  c1509. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Anne ultimately failed, and within three years of marriage Henry would sign her death warrant. Almost 500 years later we are still trying to untangle events and understand who engineered her fall. Historians keenly debate the political machinations and the many conspiracy theories pointing to who would most benefit from Anne s downfall. Certainly Henry was the greatest beneficiary. The swaggering, supremely brash monarch, who had spent so many years hotly pursuing his new love interest, is therefore a prime suspect. But in his defence, some historians plead temporary insanity   after all, Henry had been unconscious for more than two hours as a result of a head injury he sustained during a jousting accident in January 1536. Based on today s scientific evidence of concussion, this may have contributed to a swing in his character from devoted husband to a jealous, suspicious and dangerously erratic monarch. Or perhaps the answer was much more mundane. His love and forbearance for his second wife (and her tantrums) had waned over the seven years Anne had been his mistress and queen and Henry wanted out. If Henry was  over  Anne, then perhaps it was his chief schemer and chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, who could turn Anne s vulnerable position to his and Henry s advantage. A man obsessed Cromwell s involvement in Anne s downfall became an obsession for one man, imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys, but not for the reasons we might expect. Chapuys only actually met Anne once [in April 1535], but Anne fascinated the ambassador, whose reports have given us some of the most enduring and emotional scenes of her remarkable yet short reign. But Chapuys  presence in Anne s life has been given a more sinister aspect than it deserves. If we are to believe popular 18th-century historians, Chapuys was a gossip who loathed Anne and worked tirelessly to destroy her and even celebrated her death. If you believe such gossip, then this play would have its villain. But this wasn t the case. Countless letters and reports flew around and across Europe between ambassadors and monarchs, detailing Anne s very public affair with Henry. Chapuys was perhaps the most prolific of these writers. He reported to his employer, Charles V, as well as his confidantes, Mary of Hungary, governess of the Lowlands, and other diplomatic colleagues, sometimes two or three times a day. It may be surprising to learn, however, that some of the most vitriolic reports about Anne s appearance and scandalous behaviour were not written by Chapuys, but by French, Venetian and Spanish embassies. Judging from these reports, Anne was a favourite target of rumour-mongering and was generally most harshly judged by the English people and throughout Europe. But perhaps it is an anonymous, unsigned report found among imperial documents and erroneously attributed to Chapuys (who always signed his letters) that has done the most damage. Referring to Anne s coronation in 1533, the writer said:  The crown became her very ill, and a wart disfigured her very much. She wore a violet velvet mantle, with a high ruff (goulgiel) of gold thread and pearls, which concealed a swelling she has, resembling gotre (sic) . It is a harsh report to be sure, but they were not Chapuys  words. Portrait of Charles V of Spain, 1605. Found in the collection of Museo del Prado, Madrid. Artist Pantoja de la Cruz, Ju n. (Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Other historians keen to devalue Chapuys  reports claim that he was so displeased by Anne s coronation that he sulked in his lodgings, refusing to be a witness to the events. On the contrary, Chapuys  reports are brimming with details of such an historic event, clearly placing him in the middle of the four days of festivities. His only criticisms of the coronation were his observation that Londoners took little joy in the event, but he seems to have revelled in the fabulous spectacle on the Thames that teemed with a pageant of colourfully decorated vessels, as he was lavishly entertained at a banquet held on the German ambassador s barge at the very heart of celebrations.  The Concubine  One of the most prevalent fictions, and certainly one that has most tarnished Chapuys  reputation, concerns his references to Anne in his despatches. It has become an accepted fact that throughout his embassy, Chapuys  titles of choice for Anne were  la Putain  and  the Concubine . Another term,  the Lady , has also been interpreted as disparaging, although Chapuys regularly uses this for other women at court also. All this adds to the drama, but it is much overstated. Chapuys arrived at court in 1529, but he first refers to Anne as  the concubine  in one heated letter in 1533, and then not again until 1535, through to her execution. Most of his letters refer to her as  the Lady  or  Lady Anne ,  the new Marchioness  and so on. He certainly never called her queen. It is true that Chapuys did occasionally refer to Anne s daughter, Elizabeth, as  the little bastard , but more often it was simply  the king s daughter , or  other daughter . Why, then, is the view that Chapuys only used pejorative terms for Anne and Elizabeth so entrenched? The answer is likely a case of mistaken identity. While Chapuys abstained from insults (for the most part), Pedro Ortiz, Catherine of Aragon s proctor in Rome and one of her passionate defenders, wrote quite vitriolic reports about Anne to Chapuys and Charles. In most of his letters Ortiz referred to Anne as  the concubine , and did so as early as 1531 [Catherine and Henry divorced in 1533 and Henry married Anne that same year]. The pejorative descriptions of Anne belong more to Ortiz but have become attached to Chapuys; in my view the two characters have become confused. Charles V (nephew to Queen Catherine) also referred to Anne in a disparaging manner, and many of his imperial ambassadors were guided by his choice of words. The fiction that Chapuys was blinded by his hatred of Anne has allowed historians to dismiss him as gossipy and overly dramatic. Yet by reporting every detail, however immaterial, Chapuys was simply doing his duty. Far from believing all information passed to him, especially when it related to a perceived rift between Henry and Anne, Chapuys often cautioned that the intelligence might be questionable. It is important to remember that although Chapuys only actually met Anne once, he more than anyone managed to capture in his writing Anne s character: her moods, insecurities and increasing impatience, but also her moments of triumph. And by Easter 1536, Anne no doubt felt triumphant. Her rival, Catherine of Aragon, had died in January, signifying that Anne Boleyn was at last the undisputed queen. The irony was that she was now more vulnerable than ever: Henry s affection had waned and he was hotly pursuing Anne s lady-in-waiting, Jane Seymour. Politically Anne was a liability. Catherine had at least brought the Holy Roman Empire to the table, through her nephew Charles V. Anne had sought a French alliance through her connection with Francis I and his court, but France was an unreliable ally. By 1535/36 Thomas Cromwell may have begun to reconsider Anne s use. Such vulnerability would lead to an unprecedented event on 18 April 1535, just after Easter, when Anne and Eustace Chapuys came face-to-face for the first time. The event was certainly significant, but it has been long been misunderstood. So what really occurred between queen and ambassador? Jane Seymour, who by 1536 was being pursued by Henry VIII. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) An unrecognised queen Charles had not yet acknowledged Anne, and thus Chapuys, Charles s representative at the Tudor court, could not acknowledge her either. Yet according to his Easter report Chapuys seems to have been anticipating a meeting. He seemed resigned to the fact that with the prospect of peace in the air he would at some point have to acknowledge Anne as Henry s wife and queen. But there was more to it than that. Anne had also refused to officially acknowledge Charles or his ambassador, but was now aware of the necessity of an imperial alliance. She would have to acknowledge Charles, and that meant acknowledging Chapuys. Peace was at the forefront of Chapuys  mind when he approached Henry after Easter with letters from Charles to Henry. Both Chapuys and Thomas Cromwell had been working together for several months to engineer a rapprochement between both monarchs in a bid to heal the rift caused by Henry s divorce. With Catherine of Aragon gone, Charles was willing to acknowledge Anne, accept the marriage at long last and work towards peace. But nothing was set in stone. Before mass, Cromwell privately asked if Chapuys would consider meeting Anne, but Chapuys could make no such move before any treaty had been signed. He reported that  Before the King went out to mass Cromwell came to me on his part to ask if I would not go and visit and kiss the Concubine. I thought  such a visit would not be advisable, and I begged Cromwell to excuse it, and dissuade the said visit.  Throughout his embassy Chapuys remained on good terms with the Boleyn men. Several of his reports to Charles mention private dinners with Thomas and George, Anne s father and brother, and he thought nothing of meeting with George on this particular morning before Mass. He did, however, note that George seemed overly enthusiastic, making a show of speaking with the ambassador for the benefit of the court. This rather ostentatious display of friendship put Chapuys on his guard as George accompanied him to Mass. He reported that  I was conducted to the Chapel by Lord Rochefort, the concubine s brother, and when the offering came a great many people flocked round the King, out of curiosity, and wishing no doubt to know what sort of a mien the concubine and I should put on.  The entire court seems to have been eagerly waiting. What occurred is considered to be one of the most dramatic and significant events of Anne s last months. If we believe that Chapuys is the villain of the piece, this event can be construed as Anne s last triumph over Charles, making Chapuys look foolish. This would certainly make for a good story. But what Chapuys actually recounts to Charles differs significantly from the more popular version, namely that Chapuys was manipulated and  tricked  into acknowledging Anne. In his original report, Chapuys makes it quite clear that George stood beside him and he, Chapuys, did not object to being moved to where the royal couple would pass. Henry and Anne descended from the royal chapel and made their way to the altar. Chapuys wrote:  I must say that she was affable enough on the occasion for on my being placed behind the door by which she entered the chapel, she turned round to return the reverence which I made her when she passed.  Popular history tells us that Anne stopped in front of Chapuys, who was then forced to bow, to the delight of both Henry and Anne. But we must bear in mind that Chapuys says he was already bowing as the royal couple passed; it was Anne who turned and acknowledged Chapuys  show of respect. Chapuys was demonstrating that he was willing to make this small accession, and Anne was formally acknowledging and paying respect to Charles V, through his ambassador. This was momentous for both sides. We tend to focus on the significance of the event for Anne, but we must acknowledge that this was equally significant for Charles. It has been suggested that the king and Cromwell had engineered the event to send a signal to Charles that Henry could not be manipulated into a rapprochement, yet this is highly unlikely, as Charles was already willing to accept Anne as part of an alliance. Anne was in a weak position and it was a shrewd political move to acknowledge Charles through the ambassador. Her actions after mass are even more intriguing. Chapuys dined with George and Thomas Boleyn, along with other councilors, but Anne also expressed a desire to dine with Chapuys. Anne then attempted to ingratiate herself further with Charles by publicly abusing the French ambassador (which Chapuys himself often did in private), who was sure to report the incident. Anne had switched tactics, but it would not save her. Heartfelt admiration Chapuys  final description of Anne is testimony to the sort of woman she was. Beyond the divorce drama, the jealous squabbles and the treatment of Catherine and Henry's daughter Mary, Anne was, in Chapuys  eyes, innocent of the charges brought against her. His words are heartfelt in their admiration:  No one ever shewed more courage or greater readiness to meet death than she did, having, as the report goes, begged and solicited those under whose keeping she was to hasten the execution. When orders came from the King to have it [the execution] delayed until to-day, she seemed sorry, and begged and entreated the governor of the Tower for God s sake, to go to the King, and beg of him that, since she was well disposed and prepared for death, she should be despatched immediately . Engraving depicting the execution of Anne Boleyn at the Tower of London on 19 May 1536. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) Since her execution almost 500 years ago, Anne s story continues to resonate with us, as it did with Chapuys. Whatever he felt about Anne s position he nevertheless admired her intelligence and political acumen. Anne s allies abandoned her during her trial, and the court, which had once admired and served the queen, stayed silent. But Chapuys could not. In fact, he was one of the very few who publicly declared that she was innocent and a victim of a political coup. Anne s execution haunted the ambassador. As he wrote to Charles:  The executioner s sword and her own death were virtually to separate and divorce man and wife. However, if such was their intention it strikes me that it would have been a far more decent and honest excuse to allege that she had been married to another man still alive . Chapuys also wrote,  May God permit that this may be his [Henry s] last folly.  We know it would not be. Regardless of Chapuys  personal feelings towards Anne, his admiration and respect for one of the most alluring women of Henry s court, when all others voiced their condemnation, is a fascinating element of the ambassador s life. His relationship with her, gleaned from his countless reports, gives the impression of two individuals who endured a complex relationship, despite having only ever once come face-to-face. Chapuys  reports and despatches have often been twisted to suit some dramatic purpose. Those who questioned the ambassador s character and integrity as a source might be influenced by Anne s idolisation as the aggrieved queen. We continue to focus on potential culprits behind Anne s downfall but, centuries later, the truth remains tantalisingly out of reach. Lauren Mackay is the author of Inside the Tudor Court: Henry VIII and his Six Wives through the eyes of the Spanish Ambassador, which is out now in paperback Ad This article was first published by HistoryExtra in 2016",
        "target_summary": "Historian Lauren Mackay offers a compelling re-evaluation of Eustace Chapuys, Emperor Charles V's imperial ambassador, whose extensive reports have profoundly shaped our understanding of Henry VIII's court and, particularly, Anne Boleyn. Challenging the pervasive historical narrative that paints Chapuys as a venomous antagonist who loathed Anne and celebrated her demise, Mackay reveals a more intricate and often admiring figure through a meticulous analysis of his diplomatic despatches.\n\nChapuys's chronicles, spanning 15 years, are a vibrant source of detail for the period, yet Mackay argues they have been frequently misrepresented to suit dramatic portrayals. She meticulously refutes several enduring misconceptions: many of the most vitriolic reports about Anne's appearance and scandalous behavior, conventionally attributed to Chapuys, were in fact penned by other European embassies or were anonymous documents, not the ambassador’s signed letters. For example, the harsh observation about a \"wart\" and \"swelling\" at Anne's coronation did not come from Chapuys. Far from sulking in his lodgings during the coronation, as popular belief suggests, his reports brim with vivid details of the four-day festivities, confirming his active and observant presence.\n\nA significant point of contention is Chapuys's alleged constant use of derogatory terms like \"la Putain\" or \"the Concubine\" for Anne. Mackay clarifies that while Chapuys did use \"the concubine\" in some heated letters in 1533 and again from 1535 until her execution, he more frequently referred to her as \"the Lady,\" \"Lady Anne,\" or \"the new Marchioness.\" The consistent and aggressive deployment of \"the concubine\" is, Mackay asserts, largely attributable to Pedro Ortiz, Catherine of Aragon's fervent proctor in Rome, whose vitriolic letters to Chapuys and Charles V have mistakenly merged with Chapuys's own writings in historical interpretation, creating a case of \"mistaken identity.\"\n\nMackay also scrutinizes the dramatic account of Anne's sole face-to-face encounter with Chapuys in April 1535. Popular history often portrays Anne \"tricking\" Chapuys into bowing, a symbolic triumph for her over Charles V's representative. However, Chapuys's original report reveals a mutually respectful political exchange: he describes bowing as Anne passed, and she, in turn, acknowledged his reverence. This was a momentous gesture signifying both his willingness to make a small accession and her formal recognition of Charles V through his ambassador, crucial for a potential imperial alliance.\n\nCrucially, Chapuys's ultimate stance on Anne Boleyn decisively undermines his villainous portrayal. Despite enduring Henry's disruptive pursuit of Anne and the subsequent political discord, Chapuys did not celebrate her downfall. Instead, he publicly declared her innocent of the charges brought against her in 1536, viewing her as a victim of a political coup. His final descriptions convey heartfelt admiration for Anne's extraordinary courage and readiness to face death, even lamenting Henry’s \"last folly.\" This profound respect from an individual often erroneously cast as her greatest detractor highlights the complexity of their unique relationship and the integrity of Chapuys as a diligent ambassador who, despite only one meeting, captured Anne's character, moods, and triumphs with unparalleled detail. Mackay’s re-evaluation encourages historians to reconsider Chapuys as a nuanced and reliable primary source, offering a more authentic window into Anne Boleyn's compelling and tragic story.",

        "title": "A brief history of Offa s Dyke",
        "content": "Now, a new book written by two archaeologists who have been studying the Dyke for the past 15 years explores the specifically Mercian and English context for its creation. In Offa s Dyke: Landscape & Hegemony in Eighth-Century Britain, Keith Ray and Ian Bapty explore how the Dyke may have been built and what it achieved, and consider what can be learned from it. Ad Here, writing for History Extra, Keith Ray explores the history of Offa s Dyke  What makes a simple earth ditch-and-bank dug along the frontier between Wales and England 1,200 years ago potentially fascinating to any historically-minded person living in Britain in the 21st-century? For one thing, its length: the earthwork itself covers a distance of more than 80 miles (129km) and it ranges across a former frontier that spanned 115 miles (185km)   the latter extending from the shores of the Dee estuary in the north to Severn Estuary near Chepstow in the south. As such, this  great work , built at the command of Offa of Mercia, one of the most remarkable kings to have ruled much of Anglo-Saxon England, is Britain s (and arguably Europe s) longest ancient earthwork. Another remarkable thing about Offa s Dyke is the way in which so much of it has survived: a long-distance trail, the Offa s Dyke Path, follows much of its course, especially in the historic counties of Gloucestershire, Radnorshire, Shropshire and Montgomeryshire. It is, however, the context of Offa s Dyke s building that provides most relevance to life today, because there are some remarkable similarities between events in the world of late eighth-century England and today s Europe: warfare at the peripheries of the continent, mass-migration and, above all, Britain s relationship with Europe were matters of considerable concern as the expansionary Kingdom of Mercia was trying to dominate all the other kingdoms and peoples of England (and especially the remaining powers of Northumbria, East Anglia, Kent and Wessex) during the reigns of Offa (757 796) and Coenwulf (796 821). At the same time, this  Mercian regime  was trying to annexe territories of the Britons of Wales and was seeking to rival the continental empire of Charlemagne, the charismatic leader of the Kingdom of the Franks, crowned by the Pope (in 800) as Holy Roman Emperor. Silver penny of Offa, King of Mercia. 8th century. (Fitzwilliam Museum, University of Cambridge/Bridgeman Images) The supremacy of Mercia within late eighth and early ninth-century-England was reinforced by many means, including (alongside military muscle),strategic marriage-alliances, control over the Church, assassination, new forms of taxation and new duties of military service. Among those duties was one to perform  bridge-work and fortress-work , and this was probably the mechanism whereby a large work force was assembled to do the necessary aligning, quarrying, ditch-digging, soil and turf and stone mounding. This was carried out across a terrain replete with high moorland, steep-sided valleys, river-crossings and hilltops along what has become the borderland between England and Wales. So why was the Dyke built? Firstly, it served as a deterrent: it demonstrated the might of Mercian mobilisation   any kingdom with the resources to create such a massive work could surely crush any would-be invaders. Secondly, the Dyke bolstered Mercia s standing as a European power. This monumental act of building also boasted clear resonances back to the works of Roman emperors. Both Offa and Coenwulf seemingly used the Dyke as a base for carrying out military expeditions right across Wales, and the way in which the Dyke traverses the landscape resonates closely with Roman frontier works   Hadrian s Wall in particular. Offa and Coenwulf did not see themselves as  kings of the English , however, as some past Anglo-Saxon historians have suggested. They saw themselves, rather, as  emperors of Mercia . The manifest destiny of the latter kingdom was, in their world-view, to absorb all the English into Mercia (and that is possibly why the Mercians sought to build no such  barrier  between themselves and either Northumbria or Wessex, the compliance of both of which kingdoms in Mercian dominion was achieved in part through marriages of their kings with two of Offa s daughters). But how much do we really know about Offa s Dyke? There are lots of reasons to attribute the building of the Dyke to King Offa, including a direct reference to the then 100-year-old structure by King Alfred of Wessex s biographer, Asser (in a passage of his Life of King Alfred). However, the details of its construction are much more difficult to establish, as several archaeologists have discovered. It is still uncertain whether the Dyke was built in one go or whether its course linked up a series of pre-existing barriers built across ridge-top routes and river-valley trackways. It is also hard to date the Dyke accurately, due to the difficulty in finding material incorporated within or under it that belongs exactly to the period of its construction. The Dyke clearly post-dates Roman period settlements, because these have been found sealed beneath it. However, turf incorporated within its bank may also pre-date it by some time, and the activities of burrowing animals over the centuries may have introduced material that considerably post-dates its creation. At a recent excavation at Plas Offa near Chirk, for example, one radiocarbon date from turf redeposited within its bank suggested a possible origin as early as the fifth century AD, while a few metres away another sample from the base of the bank indicated a possible ninth-century date. Considerable investment of resources would be required to produce more precise dating. What is clear from even a limited re-study of the form of the Offa s Dyke earthwork and its positioning within the landscape is that it was a more complex construction than has previously been suggested. It builders deployed, for instance, careful scarping of natural slopes incorporated within it at several places, and careful adjustment of individual short lengths or segments along its course, to make it look bigger than it actually was. In this way the Dyke was designed to impress: not only by its huge span, but also in how it was to be seen from the west, dominating the landscape. Besides being built to impress, the Dyke was also designed to exclude the Welsh from their former lands and was probably used as a means to raise revenue by customs control and to monitor what was going on in the area immediately to its west. Indeed, the Dyke was positioned to overlook approaches from that direction   surveillance was as important then as it is today. Offa's Dyke on Llanfair Hill north of Knighton, Powys. (Photo by David Jones/PA) The landscape the Dyke crossed was part of an evolving frontier that needs to be seen in the context of the development of  march-lands  dividing off emergent states of the period from the surrounding peoples. This was exactly what the Franks were doing in continental Europe with the creation of the frontiers of the emergent  Carolingian Empire , replete with customs-points. The location of particularly complex stretches of the Dyke may correspond to notably sensitive  political places  along the frontier where centres of Welsh power, such as may have existed on the later sites of Powis and Montgomery castles, may have been confronted by the earthwork. This frontier, of which the Dyke formed the key   but not the only   component, may also have been made to work by creating  hybrid  groups along its length. As such, mechanisms for creating and sustaining a Mercian version of what in medieval times became part of the  Welsh marches  probably also included the formation of new frontier administrative units in which Welsh and English communities lived side-by-side under Mercian control. In c895 AD Bishop Asser, with the benefit of hindsight and in the setting of Alfred s newly-ascendant West Saxon kingdom in the late ninth-century, saw Offa s Dyke fundamentally as a vainglorious exercise by an unscrupulous and ruthless king. While this was no doubt true (within 50 years of Coenwulf s death the Danes had sliced Mercia in two and had all but crushed Wessex in military victories), we can alternatively see the Dyke as a measure of how  Mercian Britain  could envisage a future relationship with Europe on as near-equal terms as has ever been achieved since then. By laying down the origins of conscripted armies; economic power through trade and a regulated currency; a court culture in which queens as well as kings held sway; and the first formal  diplomatic missions  (such as the one in 789 that failed to successfully negotiate an alliance between the dominant power of Europe   Francia   and Mercia), Offa s kingdom provided a first glimpse of the role a newly-assertive Britain could play in a wider international setting. And it involved the attempt to forge a  new relationship  with Europe that is arguably just as elusive today as it was all those centuries ago. Ad Keith Ray is the co-author (with Ian Bapty) of Offa s Dyke: Landscape & Hegemony in Eighth-Century Britain, published by Windgather Press.",
        "target_summary": "A new book by archaeologists Keith Ray and Ian Bapty unveils the compelling story of Offa's Dyke, Britain's longest ancient earthwork, delving into its Mercian and English genesis. This colossal feat of engineering, a monumental ditch-and-bank spanning over 80 miles across a 115-mile frontier from the Dee estuary to the Severn, remains remarkably intact today, much of it preserved as a long-distance trail.\n\nErected some 1,200 years ago under the command of Offa of Mercia, one of Anglo-Saxon England's most formidable kings, the Dyke's creation resonates with enduring relevance, mirroring contemporary challenges of continental warfare, mass migration, and Britain's intricate relationship with Europe. During Offa's and Coenwulf's reigns, the expansionist Mercian kingdom sought to dominate not only other English realms but also to annex Welsh territories and assert itself against Charlemagne's formidable Frankish empire. Mercian supremacy was meticulously enforced through military might, strategic dynastic marriages, control over the Church, and new forms of taxation and military service – likely the very mechanism that conscripted the vast workforce for the Dyke's arduous construction across challenging moorlands, valleys, and rivers.\n\nThe Dyke served multiple crucial purposes. Primarily, it stood as a formidable deterrent, a stark demonstration of Mercian mobilization and power, capable of crushing any potential invaders. It simultaneously bolstered Mercia's standing as a major European power, its monumental scale intentionally evoking the grand frontier works of Roman emperors like Hadrian. Offa and Coenwulf, viewing themselves as \"emperors of Mercia,\" utilized the Dyke as a strategic launchpad for military expeditions into Wales, cementing their vision of absorbing all English kingdoms. Beyond military and political display, the Dyke was meticulously designed to impress, to visually dominate the landscape from the west, and practically, to exclude the Welsh from their former lands. It also facilitated customs control, raising revenue, and providing vital surveillance over western approaches.\n\nDespite its enduring presence and historical attribution to King Offa, the precise details of the Dyke's construction remain shrouded in mystery. Archaeologists continue to debate whether it was a single, grand undertaking or a clever amalgamation of pre-existing barriers. Accurate dating is notoriously difficult, with excavated materials yielding conflicting results spanning centuries. Nevertheless, re-studies confirm its sophisticated design, far more complex than previously imagined. Its builders expertly integrated natural slopes and adjusted segments to artificially amplify its imposing scale and ensure its commanding presence.\n\nThis evolving frontier, complete with customs-points and hybrid communities where Welsh and English lived side-by-side under Mercian control, reflects a broader European phenomenon of \"march-lands\" defining emergent states. While a later chronicler, Asser, dismissed Offa's Dyke as a mere act of vainglory, a more nuanced perspective reveals it as a testament to Mercian Britain's ambitious vision for a relationship with Europe on near-equal terms. In laying the groundwork for conscripted armies, regulated currency, a sophisticated court culture, and early diplomatic missions, Offa's kingdom offered a nascent glimpse of a newly assertive Britain's role on the international stage – a quest for a \"new relationship\" with Europe, as complex and elusive then as it remains today.",

        "content": "Royal status brings with it privilege and power   but also danger, particularly the risk of assassination by those craving that power. From the Norman conquest to Charles s execution in 1649, many British men, women and children of royal blood died in extraordinary circumstances. Deaths early in that period were often shrouded in mystery, but by the 17th century circumstances had changed to an extraordinary extent   for the first time an executioner severed the head of a king of England: Charles I, condemned by his own people  Ad William II meets his fate in the forest On 2 August 1100 King William II, third son of William the Conqueror, was hunting in the New Forest. The chronicler William of Malmesbury reported that after dinner the king, nicknamed  Rufus , went into the forest  attended by few persons , notably a gentleman named Walter Tirel. While most of the king s party  employed in the chase, were dispersed as chance directed,  Tirel remained with the king. As the sun began to set, William spotted a stag and  drawing his bow and letting fly an arrow, slightly wounded  it. In his excitement the king began to run towards the injured target, and at that point Tirel,  conceiving a noble exploit  in that the king s attention was occupied elsewhere,  pierced his breast with a fatal arrow . William fell to the ground and Tirel, seeing that the king was dead, immediately  leaped swiftly upon his horse, and escaped by spurring him to his utmost speed . Upon discovering William s body, the rest of his party fled and, in an attempt to protect their own interests, readied themselves to declare their allegiance to the next king. It was left to a few countrymen to convey the dead king s corpse to Winchester Cathedral by cart,  the blood dripping from it all the way . Was William s death an accident, or was it murder? An accident was possible, but there were many who believed otherwise. William s younger brother immediately assumed the throne and swiftly had himself crowned Henry I. Henry had much to gain from his brother s death, and Tirel may have been in his employ. William had, however, been an unpopular king, and his death was  lamented by few . King William II of England, aka William Rufus, c1100. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The Lionheart and eyeless Art Almost 100 years later, Henry I s great-grandson, Richard the Lionheart, also met a violent end at the point of an arrow, but in very different circumstances. Richard had spent the majority of his 10-year reign fighting abroad on crusade; he was a brave solider who inspired loyalty in his men. In 1199, while he was besieging the Ch teau de Ch lus-Chabrol, a crossbow bolt struck him in the shoulder. Though the shot did not kill him, it penetrated deep into his body. Though removal of the bolt by a surgeon was a painful ordeal, Richard survived   but before long the wound became infected and gangrene set in. It became clear that the king s days were numbered, and on 6 April, 11 days after he was shot,  the man devoted to martial deeds, breathed his last.  Richard was succeeded by his younger brother, John. However, though John was accepted as king of England he had a rival for his French lands: Arthur of Brittany, son of John s brother, Geoffrey, who had died over a decade earlier. In 1202, John s forces captured Arthur at Mirebeau, where the latter had been attempting to besiege the castle in which his grandmother (John s mother), Eleanor of Aquitaine, was sheltering. Arthur was taken to Falaise, where   it was later claimed   John gave orders for his 16-year-old nephew to be  deprived of his eyes and genitals , but the jailer refused to obey such a cruel command. Shortly afterwards, the boy was moved to Rouen where, on the evening of 3 April 1203, it seems that John himself,  drunk with wine and possessed of the Devil , killed Arthur personally. The young boy s lifeless body was reputedly weighed down with a heavy stone and thrown into the river Seine. In the two centuries after the murder of Arthur of Brittany, both Edward II and Richard II were deposed. The latter was almost certainly starved to death in Pontefract Castle, but controversy still surrounds the end of Edward II   he may have been murdered in Berkeley Castle, but several modern historians are of the opinion that he escaped abroad. Richard I, aka  Richard the Lionheart , depicted plunging his fist into a lion's throat, c1180. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The bloody Wars of the Roses In the middle of the 15th century, the Wars of the Roses broke out, causing a profusion of bloodshed that did not exclude royal or noble families. After a struggle that saw the Lancastrian King Henry VI deposed in favour of the Yorkist Edward IV, and a brief period of restoration for Henry VI (commonly referred to as the readeption), on 4 May 1471 the armies of Lancaster and York met at Tewkesbury, where Edward IV won  a famous victory . It was a fierce battle during which around 2,000 Lancastrians were slain, and the battlefield is still referred to as  Bloody Meadow.  For Henry s son and heir, the 18-year-old Prince Edward of Lancaster, Tewkesbury had been his first experience of war, and one that he would not survive. Reports of the precise manner of the prince s death vary: most sources state that the he was killed in the field, whereas the Yorkist author of the Arrivall of Edward IV, who claimed to be a servant of Edward IV s and a witness to many of the events about which he wrote, asserts that Edward  was taken fleeing to the townwards, and slain in the field . Later Tudor historians, however, implied that the prince had been murdered  by the avenging hands of certain persons,  on the orders of Edward IV. Whatever the circumstances, the Lancastrian heir had been removed; now all that remained was for his father to be eliminated. While the battle of Tewkesbury raged, Henry VI was a prisoner in the Tower of London. Following his victory, Edward IV travelled to London in triumph, arriving on 21 May. That same evening, Henry VI was reportedly praying in his oratory within the Wakefield Tower when he  was put to death . Though the author of the Arrivall stated that Henry died of  pure displeasure and melancholy  as a result of being told of the death of his son, there is little doubt that he died violently. The examination of his skull in 1911 revealed that to one piece  there was still attached some of the hair, which was brown in colour, save in one place, where it was much darker and apparently matted with blood,  consistent with a blow to the head. Many believed that Henry had been murdered at the hands of the king s brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, but though Richard may have been present, the order undoubtedly came from Edward IV. Henry VI , c1450. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The slaughter also extended to Edward s own family. The relationship Edward shared with his younger brother George, Duke of Clarence, was tumultuous, to say the least. After several estrangements and reconciliations, in 1477 Clarence finally went too far. Convinced that his brother was conspiring against him, Edward had Clarence arrested; at the beginning of February 1478, he was tried and condemned to death. On 18 February Clarence was executed within the confines of the Tower of London. According to several contemporary sources, at his own request the duke was drowned after being  plunged into a jar of sweet wine  in the Bowyer Tower. Clarence s daughter, Margaret Pole, was later painted wearing a bracelet with a barrel charm, which appears to support this story. The duke s death orphaned both Margaret and her younger brother Edward, Earl of Warwick. Like their father, both would meet violent ends. The princes in the Tower Edward IV died unexpectedly on 9 April 1483, leaving as successor his 12-year-old son, also Edward, at that time staying at Ludlow Castle. After his father s death, the young Prince Edward set out for London but was intercepted en route by his uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who lodged Edward and his brother Prince Richard in the Tower of London. Having been declared illegitimate, on 26 June Edward was deposed in favour of his uncle, who took the throne as Richard III. Rumours about the fate of the  princes in the Tower  soon began to circulate. Many believe that they were murdered  lying in their beds  on the orders of Richard III, and the skeletons of two youths discovered in the Tower in 1674 seems to support this theory. Some, however, insist that the boys did not die in the Tower but managed to escape. Though their ultimate fate is still obscure, one thing is certain: after the coronation of Richard III on 6 July, neither boy was seen alive again.  | Did Richard III kill the Princes in the Tower?

(Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Richard III did not hold his throne for long. In 1485 his army was confronted by the forces of the Lancastrian Henry Tudor at Bosworth in Leicestershire. Richard fought bravely in his attempt to defend his crown, but was  pierced with many mortal wounds , and became the last king of England to be killed on the battlefield. Thanks to the discovery of his skeleton in Leicester, we now know that a blow to the head killed Richard, and that his body was subjected to a number of  humiliation  wounds after his death. Richard s successor, Henry VII, ordered the execution of the Duke of Clarence s son, the Earl of Warwick, beheaded In 1499 for conspiring with the pretender Perkin Warbeck to overthrow the king. Warwick s sister, Margaret Pole, was executed in 1541 by command of Henry VIII on charges of treason. In her late sixties and condemned on evidence that was almost certainly falsified, Margaret s death shocked her contemporaries, one of whom observed that her execution was conducted by  a wretched and blundering youth  who  literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner  so that she bled to death. Henry VIII s wives Henry VIII also notoriously executed two of his wives. Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were both condemned on charges of adultery, treason, and, in Anne s case, incest with her own brother. Anne was almost certainly innocent of the crimes of which she was accused; nevertheless, on the morning of 19 May 1536 she became the first queen of England to be executed. Although her death within the confines of the Tower of London was intended to be a private affair, conducted away from the eyes of curious Londoners, around 1,000 people watched as her head was struck from her body with one strike of a French executioner s sword. In 1554 Lady Jane Grey also met her fate at the headsman s axe. So, too, did Mary, Queen of Scots, executed in February 1587 on the orders of Elizabeth I. The first queen regnant to be beheaded, Mary was decapitated at Fotheringhay Castle in a bloody scene: it took three strokes of the axe to remove her head.

(Photo by Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images) Mary s grandson was to suffer a similar ignominious end the following century. Having been defeated in the Civil War, in January 1649 Charles I became the first English monarch to be tried and condemned for treason   there was no precedent for the lawful killing of a king. On the date of his execution, 30 January, Charles stepped out of Banqueting House in Whitehall on to a public scaffold. His head was removed amid a great groan from the crowd, and it was observed that many of those who attended dipped their handkerchiefs in the late king s blood as a memento. Charles s death signalled the abolition of the monarchy, and the establishment of a republic in England. In a public display of contempt for the monarchy, he became the only king of England to be murdered by his subjects. It was a far cry from the dark and mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of William  Rufus  and those other ill-fated royals who came before. Nicola Tallis is a British historian and author.

        "target_summary": "Royal status, while granting immense privilege and power, has historically cast a long shadow of danger over its incumbents, particularly the risk of violent death. From the Norman Conquest through to the mid-17th century, a remarkable number of British royals met their ends in extraordinary, often brutal, circumstances. While earlier deaths were frequently shrouded in the mists of mystery and suspicion, later periods saw a stark shift towards public, politically motivated executions, culminating in the unprecedented beheading of a king by his own people.\n\nThe annals of early British monarchy are rife with suspicious demises. King William II, known as Rufus, met an abrupt and controversial end during a New Forest hunt in 1100. Accounts suggest his trusted companion, Walter Tirel, accidentally or deliberately shot him with an arrow. Tirel's swift flight and the immediate coronation of William's brother, Henry I, fueled suspicions of murder, though the unpopular king's death was \"lamented by few.\" Nearly a century later, the valiant Richard the Lionheart, a king more accustomed to crusading abroad, succumbed to a crossbow bolt during a siege in 1199. Though not immediately fatal, the subsequent infection and gangrene claimed the life of the warrior king. More chilling was the fate of Arthur of Brittany, Richard's nephew and rival to King John. Captured in 1202, the 16-year-old was reportedly subjected to attempts to blind and castrate him, before King John himself, \"drunk with wine and possessed of the Devil,\" allegedly murdered him and disposed of his body in the Seine. Such dark deeds set a precedent for the deposition and likely murder of future monarchs like Edward II and Richard II, the latter almost certainly starved in Pontefract Castle.\n\nThe mid-15th century plunged the realm into the devastating Wars of the Roses, an internecine conflict that unleashed a torrent of bloodshed within the royal and noble families. Following the pivotal Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, the Lancastrian heir, 18-year-old Prince Edward, was either slain on the field or brutally murdered on the orders of the victorious Edward IV. His father, the deposed King Henry VI, a prisoner in the Tower of London, subsequently met a violent end, his skull later revealing evidence of a fatal blow. The Yorkist king Edward IV himself did not shy from eliminating family, ordering the execution of his volatile brother, George, Duke of Clarence, who famously met his death by drowning in a \"jar of sweet wine\" within the Tower. But perhaps the most enduring mystery of this era concerns Edward IV's own young sons, the \"princes in the Tower.\" Following their father's unexpected death, the boys were lodged in the Tower by their uncle, Richard III, who then claimed the throne. The princes were never seen alive again, widely believed to have been murdered in their beds on Richard's command, their skeletal remains discovered centuries later lending grim credence to the theory. Richard III's reign, however, was short-lived; he himself fell at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, becoming the last English king to die on the battlefield, his body subjected to post-mortem \"humiliation wounds.\"\n\nThe Tudor era ushered in a new, albeit equally ruthless, form of royal elimination: state-sanctioned execution. Henry VII ordered the beheading of Edward, Earl of Warwick, the son of the ill-fated Duke of Clarence, for conspiring against the crown. Later, Henry VIII commanded the execution of Warwick's sister, Margaret Pole, a woman in her late sixties condemned on likely fabricated charges of treason. Her gruesome death, where a blundering executioner \"literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces,\" shocked contemporaries. Henry VIII also notoriously sent two of his own queens, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, to the block on charges of adultery and treason, Anne becoming the first queen of England to be executed, her head severed by a French swordsman before a crowd of 1,000. This grim precedent continued with the executions of Lady Jane Grey and, most notably, Mary, Queen of Scots, who in 1587 endured a bloody decapitation requiring three axe strokes at Fotheringhay Castle, ordered by her cousin Elizabeth I.\n\nThe dramatic evolution of royal mortality reached its zenith in the following century. In 1649, after a bitter Civil War, King Charles I faced an unprecedented trial and condemnation for treason by his own subjects. Stepping onto a public scaffold outside Whitehall's Banqueting House, Charles I was publicly beheaded, eliciting a collective groan from the crowd. This singular event, marking the first time an English monarch was lawfully killed by his people, not only signaled the abolition of the monarchy but also completed the stark transformation of royal demise, from the shadowy \"accident\" of Rufus to a deliberate, public spectacle of revolutionary justice.",

        "title": "The real history behind Victoria series two",
        "content": "Series one of ITV's Victoria introduced a new TV audience to the early years of the monarch's reign, tracing her remarkable story from a teenage royal sleeping in the same bedroom as her mother to one of the most powerful women in the world. While much of the first series focused on the growing relationship between the queen and her beloved Albert, series two sees the diminutive monarch become a mother, having to balance a new maternal role with her position at the head of a vast empire. As a new series begins, HistoryExtra spoke to series writer Daisy Goodwin about what the 1840s held in store for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert  Ad Q: This series takes us into a new decade, the 1840s. Where do we pick up the story in season two and what did these next few years hold for Victoria and Albert? A: We pick up a few weeks after the birth of the Princess Royal, and Victoria is going through  confinement . In those days, aristocratic women stayed in bed after the birth of their baby and had up to six weeks of bed rest. I discovered that, during this time, the queen was taken everywhere in a Bath chair [a wheeled carriage for one person]. I thought that Victoria might get a bit bored by all that; she s only 21. I imagined that she would spring  back to life , only to discover (as some people might when coming back from maternity leave) that life has gone on without her. I think all of that comes as a bit of a shock to her. Victoria has a lot of children in the 1840s. She s pregnant pretty much all the time, so that s a challenge for her and for Prince Albert. It s also an incredibly important political period; it was called the  hungry forties . We see the birth of the Chartist movement [which campaigned for the rights of working people]. It was a time of incredible political unrest, which was seen in the reform of the Corn Laws [regulations which governed the import and export of grain], which were as seismic then as Brexit is now. There s a disastrous Irish famine after the potato crop failed in successive years. There s also threat of a war with France. As this is all going on, Victoria and Albert are trying to negotiate their lives as parents and as a couple, and they have a very volatile marriage. They re devoted to each other, but there s a power struggle, and I think it s a power struggle that a lot of people will recognise. It s a time of personal and political ferment. Series two sees Victoria and Albert adjusting to their new roles as parents in the turbulent 1840s. (  Mammoth Screen for ITV) Q: A key theme in the new series is how Victoria struggled with motherhood. Can you tell how this was viewed at the time and what s your interpretation of this in 2017? A: In 2017, I think we rather sentimentalise motherhood; we have far fewer children, so we want to capture every moment. We almost fetishise it. What s interesting about Victoria is that she is a reluctant mother; she s got no access to contraception so she has no choice. I think she s not happy about the  invasion  of her body by pregnancy. She called it the  shadow side of her marriage . She loves her children and she s clearly very attached to them, but she doesn t coo over babies. At one point, she says:  all babies look like frogs to me.  In many ways, she s still a child who didn t get enough love herself, and perhaps that affects the way she views her own children. After the birth of her second child,  Bertie  (the Prince of Wales who would become Edward VII), she almost certainly had what we would now call postnatal depression. This obviously wasn t recognised at the time, as back then women were considered to be odd creatures prone to many  strange emotions . It was very difficult for her to deal with the feelings she had after the birth of Bertie. She didn t write in her diary for a while and I think that was very unlike her. Having suffered from postnatal depression myself, I know that she would have been affected by something you can t really deal with or understand. For Queen Victoria, this must have been very difficult indeed, to be a queen and also to be in the grip of this mental illness. She came through it and she had nine children, but it must have taken a terrific toll on her both physically and mentally. Yet she battled on, which I think is pretty impressive. Queen Victoria had nine babies over 17 years, a tremendous physical feat. (  Mammoth Screen for ITV) Q: How might we see Victoria s relationship with Albert changing now that they re parents? Has some of the romance that we saw in series one worn off? A: There was a very strong bond between them. In this series, we see how their relationship evolved and matured, though it was still based on terrific attraction. However, underpinning it all was this slightly difficult question for them of who s the more powerful figure in the relationship. He was the husband and the  master , while she was the wife and the queen. As a 19th-century couple, it was very difficult for them to negotiate who s really in charge. She tried very hard to make him think that he was the boss, though ultimately, she was the one with the money and the power. We know that she very much enjoyed her sex life, though the fact that she enjoyed it so much meant that she was always pregnant! Q: You ve shared how you draw heavily on Victoria s own diaries when shaping the series. Can you tell us a little bit about the diaries and the details you uncovered in them? A: She was a prolific diarist: she wrote almost every day, writing 62 million words! Most of the diaries we have today were censored by her daughter Beatrice for publication, but there s one section that seems to have been passed by. In this section, Victoria writes very candidly about the trials and tribulations of being a mother, about how she loathes her own mother, and she s very frank about her sex life with Albert. Not explicit things, but she writes about evenings being the  best night of her life , or  last night was awful, no fun . It s pretty clear what s going on; there s a funny line I found where she describes how wonderful Albert looks in his  white, cashmere britches  with nothing on underneath! She s very frank about her admiration for the male form, which I think is rather charming. I think she always knew that these diaries would be seen. While she was writing for posterity, she also knew that her mother might read them, that her governess might read them   later she thought that Albert would be reading them, so they weren t entirely frank. I think they were slightly disingenuous in parts; there were times when she knew that they were being read and there were other moments when she was writing for herself. She probably knew that at some point they would have been read by the nation. She was certainly the first monarch to publish a bestselling book based on her journals: Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands (1868). Jenna Coleman becomes a mother in series two of 'Victoria', written by Daisy Goodwin. (  Mammoth Screen for ITV) Q: How do you go about balancing historical accuracy and making this series dramatically exciting and suitable for a TV audience? A: It s a drama, not a documentary, and I try and shape events around a dramatic structure. There are some characters I have created a dramatic story for, but Victoria and Albert s stories are pretty close. I do take liberties here and there: for instance, she doesn t have five children in four years on screen, as I felt that might get a little repetitive for viewers! However, we do see the impact of bearing all of these children. In terms of shaping the story, I get to a point where I m steeped in the history and I then I try to distil the most exciting, dramatic and truthful version that I can. Wherever possible, the drama is inspired by real events, whether they are assassination attempts, the repeal of the Corn Laws or the terrible potato famine. All the big building blocks of the series are true. I m not saying that you can watch Victoria and it s your GCSE History Victorians module done, but you d have a pretty good idea of what s going on. I hope that I ve inspired quite a lot of people to go off and find out more about the subjects. I m passionate about people becoming interested in history and pleased that it s been a by-product of this series. Q: Why do you think that this story is still so fascinating for 2017 TV audiences? A: I think people are still very interested in stories of queens; people like seeing what happens when a young woman is given power, as it s so unusual. I suppose that there is something about watching Britain at a time when it s beginning a journey to becoming a great nation. It s full of excitement and discovery. We re surrounded by monuments and reminders of the Victorian era today: the Victoria and Albert museum, our street layouts, statues, stations, railway networks, and sewers. A lot of our infrastructure is still Victorian. It s a time that still fascinates people.

        "target_summary": "ITV's \"Victoria\" gracefully introduced audiences to the early reign of the iconic monarch, tracing her remarkable journey from a teenage royal to a globally powerful woman, with its initial series deeply exploring her burgeoning romance with Prince Albert. Series two dramatically shifts focus, however, plunging the diminutive queen into the demanding realities of motherhood, where she must skillfully reconcile her new maternal role with the immense responsibilities of leading a vast empire.\n\nWriter Daisy Goodwin reveals that the second series commences in the tumultuous 1840s, mere weeks after the birth of the Princess Royal. Victoria, still only 21 and confined to her bed, chafes at the boredom and the unsettling feeling of life continuing without her—a stark awakening to the challenges of balancing her personal and public worlds. This decade, famously dubbed the \"hungry forties,\" was a period of intense political and social upheaval. Victoria and Albert navigate frequent pregnancies amidst the fervent Chartist movement, the seismic repeal of the Corn Laws (as impactful as modern-day Brexit), a devastating Irish potato famine, and the ever-present threat of war with France. This external turbulence mirrors their own deeply devoted yet often volatile marriage, marked by an intricate power struggle between husband and queen.\n\nGoodwin highlights Victoria's strikingly candid, and perhaps surprisingly modern, struggles with motherhood. Far from romanticizing the experience, Victoria viewed pregnancy as an \"invasion\" of her body, famously terming it the \"shadow side of her marriage.\" While she undoubtedly loved her children, she eschewed sentimental cooing, once remarking, \"all babies look like frogs to me.\" Her own challenging upbringing likely colored this perspective, and after the birth of her second child, Bertie, she almost certainly suffered from what we now recognize as postnatal depression—a condition tragically unacknowledged in her era. Battling through nine pregnancies over 17 years, Victoria's resilience in the face of such profound physical and mental strain is truly impressive.\n\nThe series further explores the maturation of Victoria and Albert's relationship, which, while still fueled by intense attraction, continually grapples with an inherent power imbalance. As a 19th-century husband, Albert was traditionally the \"master,\" yet Victoria commanded ultimate power and wealth as queen. Goodwin draws heavily on Victoria's extensive, albeit sometimes self-censored, diaries—a monumental 62 million words—to reveal intimate glimpses into her private thoughts on motherhood, her fraught relationship with her own mother, and her vibrant sex life with Albert, even admiring him in \"white, cashmere britches\" with nothing underneath. Though writing for posterity, Victoria was fascinatingly aware her journals might be read, blending personal expression with a public persona.\n\nGoodwin emphasizes that \"Victoria\" is a meticulously crafted drama, not a documentary, structuring events around a compelling narrative while largely adhering to significant historical \"building blocks\" like assassination attempts and major political reforms. Her aim is not to deliver a history lesson but to ignite curiosity, hoping viewers delve deeper into the endlessly fascinating Victorian era. The enduring appeal of Victoria's story, Goodwin suggests, lies in the timeless intrigue of a young woman wielding immense power, set against the backdrop of Britain's formidable rise as a global force—an era whose monumental infrastructure and unwavering confidence continue to shape and captivate us today. The series holds the tantalizing promise of exploring Victoria's extraordinary reign well into her later years, should the creative energy persist.",

Creating the Royal Flight was a most innovative action by King Edward VIII, although members of the royal family had enjoyed a passion for flying almost since the dawn of aviation. The first confirmed flight by a member of the Royal Family was when Edward, the Prince of Wales   while on a visit to Villaverta on the Italian Front on 27 September 1918   was invited to fly in the rear cockpit of a Bristol F.2B Fighter with Captain WG Barker of the RAF s Number 139 Squadron. Interestingly, the prince remained standing in the rear cockpit throughout the short flight. Shortly after the end of the First World War, Prince Albert took a flying course at Croydon and was awarded his wings on 31 July 1919. However, it was the Prince of Wales s fervent interest in aviation that led him to purchase his very own de Havilland DH.60G Gipsy Moth in September 1929 and which ultimately led to the formation of the King s Flight. Edward later took flying lessons in the aircraft and soon earned his own wings under the tutelage of one Squadron Leader Don. Later, Edward added two further de Havilland aircraft to his own private collection before the flight was moved to RAF Hendon in late 1930. Shortly after the move, the aircraft were unofficially nicknamed  The Royal Flight  by staff on the airfield, although it would be another six years before the King s Flight would be officially formed. Other Royal Air Force aircraft were allocated to  official  royal duties and the sight of members of the Royal Family travelling by air became commonplace. Over the years, the King s and Queen s Flight have operated an interesting variety of aircraft and helicopters, many of British design and manufacture. Royal visits have provided an excellent opportunity to promote British aviation. One chapter in the book is dedicated the experiences of those who flew members of the royal family during the last years of the Queen s Flight, which was finally disbanded on 31 March 1995 and merged with the RAF s Number 32 (The Royals) Squadron.

        "target_summary": "Keith Wilson's compelling work for History Extra delves into the rich and enduring relationship between the British royal family and the realm of aviation, magnificently illustrated by a collection of remarkable images. The narrative traces this aerial heritage from the very dawn of powered flight, culminating in the official formation of the King's Flight in 1936 – an innovative move for an era when passenger flying was still in its infancy.\n\nYet, royal enthusiasm for the skies predated this formal establishment by decades. As early as 1918, Edward, then Prince of Wales, undertook the first confirmed royal flight, bravely standing in the rear cockpit of a Bristol F.2B Fighter during a visit to the Italian Front. Shortly thereafter, his brother Prince Albert (the future King George VI) honed his own piloting skills, earning his wings in 1919. However, it was Edward's profound passion for aviation that truly propelled royal flying forward. In 1929, he acquired his personal de Havilland DH.60G Gipsy Moth, mastering the controls himself and quickly assembling a private fleet that, by 1930, was informally dubbed \"The Royal Flight\" by staff at RAF Hendon, foreshadowing its official recognition six years later.\n\nOver the years, the King's, and subsequently the Queen's, Flight showcased an impressive array of British-designed and manufactured aircraft, transforming royal travel into an exceptional platform for promoting the nation's aviation industry on a global stage. The dedicated pilots who flew these royal missions, such as Flt Lt Steve Hunt, have shared unique and often fond recollections of transporting the royal party across continents. The Flight’s distinguished service concluded in 1995 when it merged with the RAF’s Number 32 (The Royals) Squadron.\n\nWilson's \"Royal Flying: A Pictorial History\" expands beyond the institutional narrative, also chronicling the personal flying careers of successive generations of royals. Vivid photographic evidence captures Edward, Prince of Wales, poised in his 1918 fighter; the Duke and Duchess of York embarking on their inaugural joint flight in a de Havilland airliner in 1934; King George VI meticulously inspecting a new de Havilland Flamingo in 1940; and the rare, vibrant image of the King's personal Viking aircraft crew during a significant 1947 tour of South Africa. The passion continued with Princess Margaret exploring the cockpit of the groundbreaking Comet 1 in 1951, and Prince Philip, demonstrating characteristic vigour, learning to fly with the RAF in 1952, making his first solo flight by December of that year. From his early Chipmunk training to piloting Whirlwind helicopters, Prince Philip’s lifelong dedication to aviation inspired future royals, with Prince Charles taking to the skies in a powerful Vulcan B.2 and Prince William commencing his basic flying tuition in a Grob Tutor, continuing this remarkable aerial legacy.",

        "content": "Adapted from Philippa Gregory s bestselling novel of the same name, The White Princess centres on the marriage of Elizabeth of York and King Henry VII. This union between the rival houses of York and Lancaster was seen to bring peace after the Wars of the Roses, a series of conflicts between 1450 and 1500 that saw England riven by revolts, murderous coups, financial collapse and full-scale battles. Ad However, the series suggests that despite the union between the two houses, personal and political rifts continued to run deep. In the drama, rumours circulate that Elizabeth of York s long-lost brother Prince Richard, son of Edward IV and his queen Elizabeth Woodville, is alive and planning to take the throne.  Lizzie  is forced to choose between her new husband and a boy who could be her own blood and the rightful Yorkist king. The White Princess charts one of the most tumultuous times in British history from the point of view of the women waging the ongoing battle for the English throne. But who were the key players in this story? We explore the real characters behind the series  Elizabeth of York Jodie Comer as Elizabeth of York. (  Starz) The White Princess dramatises  Lizzie s  marriage to the first Tudor king Henry VII, her relationship with her mother the Dowager Queen Elizabeth, and her new mother-in-law, Margaret Beaufort. She may not have sought the limelight as much as some of her contemporaries, but Elizabeth of York was a Tudor of rare talent, writes Alison Weir. Portrayed by Jodie Comer in the series, Elizabeth of York played an important role in the Wars of the Roses and the early Tudor story. Alison Weir:  Born in 1466, Elizabeth was the eldest daughter of the Yorkist king Edward IV, sister of the princes in the Tower, and niece of Richard III, who had her and her siblings declared bastards so that he could claim the throne. The probable murder of her brothers in the Tower of London in 1483 meant that, in the eyes of many, Elizabeth was the rightful queen of England. Richard III himself contemplated marrying her, but in 1485 Henry Tudor, who claimed to be the heir to the House of Lancaster and had sworn to marry Elizabeth, came from France with an army and defeated Richard at the battle of Bosworth. Thus was founded the Tudor dynasty. Elizabeth was intelligent and beautiful. A Venetian report described her as  a very handsome woman of great ability, and in conduct very able,  beloved for her abundant  charity and humanity . The humanist scholar Erasmus described her in one word:  brilliant . That there was affection and tenderness between Henry and Elizabeth cannot be doubted.   here. Margaret Beaufort Michelle Fairley as Margaret Beaufort. (  Starz) She fell pregnant at 12, was widowed by the Wars of the Roses and almost died at the hands of Richard III. But, writes Michael Jones, nothing could prevent the indomitable Margaret Beaufort from engineering the rise of her son, Henry VII, to the English throne. Described by Jones as  truly one of history s great survivors,  the mother of the first Tudor king is played by Game of Thrones' Michelle Fairley in the series, and she has spent her entire adult life setting the stage for her son to become king. Michael Jones:  Margaret s father had died shortly before her first birthday and so she was brought up by her mother, Margaret Beauchamp. Her mother instilled in her a strong sense of personal destiny and family pride. Despite her young age, Margaret was bright and remarkably self-assured. Above all, she was well aware of the opportunities beckoning her. That she would go on to take full advantage of these opportunities is beyond doubt. For, in the face of huge obstacles and sometimes mortal peril, Margaret played the 15th-century game of power-politics with bravery and determination. And, on 22 August 1485, her perseverance was rewarded when her son, Henry Tudor, defeated Richard III at the battle of Bosworth to become king. Charting Margaret s role in Henry s rise to power   and the establishment of the Tudor dynasty   reveals the skill-set of one of the great political survivors of the late Middle Ages.   about Margaret Beaufort, mother of the Tudors Dowager Queen Elizabeth Essie Davis as Dowager Queen Elizabeth. (  Starz) Essie Davis plays the Dowager Queen Elizabeth in the series. Once queen of England, having been married to King Edward IV, we meet Elizabeth Woodville in her later years as the dowager queen, following the premature death of her husband and two sons. The White Princess sees Lizzie's mother plotting continuously to put the House of York back on the throne. Writing on Elizabeth Woodville s earlier years and relationship with Edward IV, late medieval and early Tudor historian Amy Licence says that at five years older than her royal husband, Elizabeth Woodville was an unlikely queen. Amy Licence:  While none could fault her personal charms, Elizabeth was considered an unacceptable choice for an English queen by most of Edward s advisors. She was a widow, a mother already, born and married into Lancastrian families, the daughter of a mere knight, a man whom Edward had formerly held in contempt. She brought no dowry or international connections, no territories or promise of diplomatic support. What she did bring was her fertility, bearing the king 10 children in addition to the two sons from her first husband, Sir John Grey. Elizabeth also brought in a model of queenship that differed vastly from that of the woman she replaced, the Lancastrian Margaret of Anjou. Elizabeth may have begun her reign as unsuitable and unpopular but in fact, she was the perfect embodiment of the beautiful, submissive, fertile queen   an archetype of medieval literature.   about the marriage of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville Henry VII Jacob Collins-Levy as Henry VII. (  Starz) Played by Jacob Collins-Levy in The White Princess, we meet the dashing and handsome Henry VII as he has finally taken the crown for himself, after defeating Richard III at the bloody battle of Bosworth in 1485. The first Tudor monarch may not win many popularity contests, writes Steven Gunn, but the king set the blueprint for a dynasty that was to make England a global power. In the series, he is resentful of the duty that requires having to marry a woman who openly despises him, and is heavily influenced by his powerful mother, Margaret Beaufort. Yet while Elizabeth and Henry s marriage was a politically driven match, there s evidence that  Henry clearly grew to love, trust and respect Elizabeth . Steven Gunn:  Henry VII is the inscrutable Tudor. Less charismatic than Henry VIII or Elizabeth, less tragic than Edward or Mary, he stands no realistic chance in a Most Famous Tudor competition. But that is no reason to forget him. We should admire Henry first for his tenacity. When he was propelled from exile to the English throne in 1485 by the sudden death of Edward IV, Richard III s seizure of the crown and the bloody battle of Bosworth, six of the last nine English kings had been deposed. And the average was getting worse: each of the last four had lost the crown; one of them, the hapless Henry VI, twice. Henry was not just a survivor but a stabiliser. He was less trusting, less generous and less relaxed than many of his subjects might have liked: he is only recorded as laughing in public once.   about the rule of Henry VII Richard III Richard III, image undated. (Photo by Apic/Getty Images) Although he died before the historical events depicted in The White Princess, Richard III still casts a significant shadow over the drama. In her original story, Gregory builds on the speculation that the king was the lover of Elizabeth of York before her marriage to Henry VII, and also suspected of murdering the two sons of the dowager queen. As such, Richard III features heavily in much of the show s action. So, who was the king and how true are the accusations against him? John Ashown Hill:  It has frequently been claimed (on the basis of reports of a letter, the original of which does not survive), that in 1485 Richard III planned to marry his niece, Elizabeth of York, eldest daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. There is no doubt that rumours to this effect were current in 1485, and we know for certain that Richard was concerned about them. That is not surprising, since his invitation to mount the throne had been based upon the conclusion that all of Edward IV s children were bastards. Obviously no logical monarch would have sought to marry a bastard niece. In fact, very clear evidence survives that proves beyond question that Richard did intend to remarry in 1485. However, his chosen bride was the Portuguese princess Joana. What s more, his diplomats in Portugal were also seeking to arrange a second marriage there   between Richard s illegitimate niece, Elizabeth, and a minor member of the Portuguese royal family!  Ad Elsewhere, Ashdown Hill also considers the charge that Richard III murdered the princes in the Tower:  There is no evidence that Edward of Westminster, Henry VI, the  princes in the Tower  or Anne Neville were murdered by anyone. Edward of Westminster was killed at the battle of Tewkesbury, and Anne Neville almost certainly died naturally. Also, if Richard III really had been a serious killer in the interests of his own ambitions, why didn t he kill Lord and Lady Stanley   and John Morton?",
        "target_summary": "Adapted from Philippa Gregory's bestselling novel, \"The White Princess\" plunges viewers into the tumultuous aftermath of England's Wars of the Roses, centering on the politically charged marriage of Elizabeth of York and King Henry VII. This union, intended to finally forge peace after decades of conflict, instead reveals that deep personal and political rifts persisted, often viewed through the eyes of the powerful women navigating this treacherous landscape.\n\nAt the heart of the drama is **Elizabeth of York**, a woman of rare talent and beauty, described as intelligent, charitable, and \"brilliant.\" Born into royalty as the eldest daughter of Edward IV, she endured the tragic loss of her brothers, the \"Princes in the Tower,\" and, though declared a bastard by her uncle Richard III, was still considered by many England's rightful queen. Her marriage to Henry Tudor, the victorious Lancastrian at Bosworth, founded the enduring Tudor dynasty, and despite its political origins, historical accounts suggest a genuine affection blossomed between them.\n\nLooming large as a formidable and \"indomitable\" force is **Margaret Beaufort**, Henry VII's mother. A true \"survivor\" who overcame early widowhood, peril from the Wars of the Roses, and the challenges of early motherhood, Margaret possessed a profound sense of destiny. From a young age, she meticulously engineered her son's ascent, playing the dangerous game of 15th-century power politics with unparalleled bravery and unwavering determination, her relentless ambition and strategic genius instrumental in establishing the Tudor reign.\n\nAdding another layer of intrigue is the **Dowager Queen Elizabeth Woodville**, mother to Elizabeth of York. Once an \"unlikely queen\" given her modest origins and Lancastrian ties, she proved a fertile and charismatic consort to Edward IV. In her later years, as a grieving widow and mother, she is depicted continuously plotting to restore the Yorkist line, embodying a relentless maternal drive for her family's legacy.\n\nThe \"dashing and handsome\" **Henry VII**, first Tudor monarch, is initially depicted as resentful of his duty to marry Elizabeth, a woman who seemingly despised him, and heavily influenced by his formidable mother. While he might not win popularity contests, Henry was a tenacious \"stabiliser\" who navigated the precarious throne with steely resolve. Despite his less charismatic public persona, evidence suggests he ultimately developed love, trust, and respect for his Yorkist queen, thus laying the foundations for England's rise to global power.\n\nThough his reign concludes before the series' primary timeline, **Richard III** casts a significant, villainous shadow. The drama draws on historical speculation, portraying him as a potential lover of Elizabeth of York and the prime suspect in the murder of her brothers, the Princes in the Tower. However, historical analyses challenge these popular accusations, pointing to his intentions to marry the Portuguese princess Joana rather than his niece Elizabeth, and finding no conclusive evidence for his involvement in the princes' deaths, thus portraying him as a more complex figure than pure villainy allows.",

        "title": "lfthryth: England s first queen",
        "content": "This article was first published in the May 2017 edition of BBC History Magazine Ad If asked to name a medieval queen of England, most would probably fasten upon Eleanor of Aquitaine, the influential wife of Henry II, made famous by Katharine Hepburn in The Lion in Winter. A few Plantagenet and Tudor enthusiasts might think of Elizabeth Woodville, the capable consort of Edward IV and grandmother to Henry VIII. One or two of the more adventurous might even fix upon Emma of Normandy, the indomitable wife of King Cnut in the early 11th century. Many would struggle to think of any at all. But very few indeed would name  lfthryth, the third wife of King Edgar (reigned 959 75) and mother of  thelred  the Unready  (r978 1013 and 1014 16). This is understandable. Beyond her outlandish name (sometimes modernised as Elfrida),  lfthryth faces a number of difficulties. For a start, our sources for her life are much scarcer than they are for her more famous successors. To this may be added the lower public profile of Anglo-Saxon history. All too often we think of the Middle Ages as starting in 1066. Before this lurks the mysterious  Dark Ages : a period filled with fascinating, semi-mythical figures such as Arthur and Merlin, but little in the way of real historical evidence. Still, it is a pity that she is not better known, for if any medieval English queen deserves to be a household name, it is  lfthryth. And for all the importance of an Eleanor or an Elizabeth, it is  lfthryth who has the honour of being the  first queen of England .  lfthryth s reign came at a decisive time in English history. The second half of the ninth century had seen the Vikings subdue the north and east of England. Only the kingdom of Wessex, south of the Thames, survived   and this only thanks to the dogged efforts of Alfred the Great (r871 99). Under Alfred s successors, the English went on the offensive, and by his grandson  thelstan s time (r924 39) most of what is now England had been brought under their control. Later kings had to fight hard to maintain these gains, but in the end they succeeded.  lfthryth herself was born in the early to mid-940s to a prominent family in the South West. Upon coming of age, she was married to  thelwold, the ealdorman of East Anglia (a royal officer, the equivalent of the later  earl ).  thelwold s family was one of the most powerful in England (his father had borne the nickname  half-king , on account of his quasi-regal standing) and in this capacity he was responsible for almost a quarter of the realm. However,  thelwold soon died under circumstances that are unclear. But rather than a setback, this proved the making of the young  lfthryth. Rival spouses In 964  lfthryth, still only in her late teens or early twenties, went on to marry King Edgar, who had himself succeeded to the throne five years earlier. Like  lfthryth, Edgar had been married before. In fact, he had two prior spouses, one of whom was still alive. Not surprisingly, there were questions as to whether this was a true marriage  till death do us part : an indissoluble union in the language of the church. Such concerns were soon put to rest, however. On the occasion of the marriage itself, Edgar granted land to his new wife   a particular honour accorded to neither of his previous consorts. In fact, this seems to have been a different kind of union from the outset. Unlike her predecessors,  lfthryth regularly appeared in government records. And, far from being there for purely decorative purposes, she seems to have influenced and guided royal policy. Before this, royal wives had been minor players. They appear only rarely in the documentary record, and when they do, they invariably bear the title  king s wife  or  king s consort  rather than  queen . Such terms emphasise the dependency of these women on their husband; queen was not yet an office in its own right. But this too was now to change. From the start,  lfthryth is styled  queen . The ruins of Corfe Castle, Dorset, England. (Alamy) The reason for this change lies in another break with tradition:  lfthryth was also the first consort of England to be crowned and consecrated. The tradition of royal consecration had developed on the continent in the early Middle Ages. At its heart lay the ritual anointing of the monarch with holy oil and investment with symbols of office (above all, the crown   hence the modern term  coronation ). The ceremony enacted and symbolised the transition from heir apparent to king, and was thought to endow the monarch with divine favour. It made him king  by the grace of God . Royal consecration had become common in England in the ninth century, but it was reserved for ruling monarchs, invariably men. That  lfthryth should be formally anointed like her husband marks an important point of departure. It indicates that, in both practical and symbolic terms, queenship was starting to become an office.  lfthryth s influence would not be owed entirely to her husband, but also to  divine grace . The partnership between  lfthryth and Edgar is visible throughout the remaining years of his reign. In the year of their marriage, they began to reform the bishopric of Winchester. This was a process that involved removing the existing clergy, who were accused of lax standards, and replacing them with monks. In future years, the two worked closely to foster similar reforms elsewhere. And when, in 973, Edgar decided to undergo a spectacular second coronation at Bath,  lfthryth was right there by his side. A succession struggle In early July 975, at the height of his powers, Edgar died at the age of no more than 32. This had not been foreseen, and a succession struggle soon erupted. This pitted  lfthryth and Edgar s son,  thelred, against Edgar s eldest son, Edward ( thelred s half-brother). Most surprising is that there was a dispute at all. Though succession rules had yet to be formalised, it was generally anticipated that the eldest son would succeed (at least in the absence of a royal brother). That some were willing to back the much younger son  thelred, who may only have been six at the time, requires some explanation. It s likely that the imposing figure of  lfthryth lay behind their decision. As queen, she had enjoyed great power and influence and was understandably hesitant to let go of this. Edward s succession posed a real threat to her. If Edward proved long-lived, there was every chance that  thelred might be cut out of the succession. Yet  lfthryth was not just power-hungry. As a consecrated queen, she may have felt that she was more legitimate than Edgar s previous wives: his only true consort. And if this were so, then  thelred was his only true offspring. It was this that seems to have been the real point of contention: was Edward a throne-worthy heir, or an illegitimate bastard? Some were clearly convinced of the latter, but in the end age trumped legitimacy and Edward was consecrated king in his father s stead. Edward s succession was a major blow to  lfthryth, and such wounds were not easily healed. Barely had Edward taken control of the realm, when he was killed at Corfe in Dorset by supporters of  thelred and  lfthryth. He had been travelling to visit the two at the time, and it is hardly surprising that suspicion has often fallen upon them. However, contemporary sources, of which there is little shortage, do not implicate them. We are probably dealing with a situation rather like that of Henry II and Thomas Becket two centuries later: one of zealous supporters seeking to do their masters a favour, and going beyond their orders. Whatever the precise circumstances, this act landed  thelred on the throne that his mother had worked so hard to secure for him. However, he was still a child (no older than 12, and perhaps only eight or nine) so there could be no question of him ruling on his own. Instead, an informal regency was established with  lfthryth and her supporters at its head. For the next six years, it was they who would rule with quiet efficiency. Only when the queen regent s chief allies,  lfhere of Mercia and Bishop  thelwold of Winchester, died in quick succession in 983 and 984, did  thelred finally take control of affairs. Initially, he distanced himself from the politics of his regents, and for the next eight or nine years  lfthryth disappears from the record entirely. She was clearly removed from court, and her policies with her. Crisis of confidence These years saw something of a youthful rebellion from the teenage  thelred, who took the opportunity to promote new favourites and attack religious houses associated with his earlier regents. Yet it was also at this juncture that the Vikings began to plague his coasts. In 991 they defeated a major English force at Maldon in Essex.  thelred suddenly suffered a crisis of confidence. As was common in the Middle Ages, the king interpreted this as a sign of divine displeasure, and set about mending his errant ways   starting with restoring his mother to favour. He welcomed  lfthryth back at court and reversed previous policies.  thelred also charged his mother with the important task of raising his children (her own grandchildren, the heirs to the throne). Reconciliation seems to have been complete. When  lfthryth died on 17 November 1001, the king was deeply moved. She was buried at Wherwell, the nunnery she had founded in Hampshire. Soon after  thelred issued an extraordinary document in favour of this centre. Like most royal enactments, the resulting text opens with a meditation on God s will. Yet unlike other documents of the era, this quotes the biblical dictum:  Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return,  then cites the fifth commandment:  Honour thy father and thy mother .  lfthryth s legacy lived on in the queens who followed her.  thelred s second wife, Emma of Normandy, cut quite the figure in future years, as did Edith, the wife of Edward the Confessor (and the sister of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England). The office of queen had been born, and had a long and bright history before it. Levi Roach is a lecturer in history at the University of Exeter and author of  thelred the Unready (Yale University Press, 2016).  lfthryth s inspiration Two women who set the template for the queen s achievements In the years before  lfthryth, the status of royal women varied significantly. The dynasty that united England in the early 10th century was that of Wessex (south of the Thames), and prevailing attitudes were drawn from there. At the time of Alfred the Great, the king s Welsh biographer, Bishop Asser, criticised the  strange  West Saxon tradition of denying royal consorts the title of queen   a custom that reportedly went back to the king Beorhtric in the early ninth century (r786 802), whose wife accidentally poisoned him! This is the stuff of legend, but whatever the real grounds, West Saxon royal women   aside from Judith, crowned queen of the West Saxons in 856   did not have a high profile. Elsewhere, matters were different. In the Midlands kingdom of Mercia, royal wives traditionally held a more active role. It is here that the most famous female figure of the 10th century is to be found:  thelfl d,  lady of the Mercians .  thelfl d was the eldest daughter of Alfred the Great. She married the Mercian nobleman  thelred, who oversaw the region on Alfred s behalf. When her husband died in 911, she took power, working with her brother, King Edward the Elder (r899 924), to conquer much of the east Midlands and East Anglia. Her political links to Wessex doubtless helped her position, but her achievement is no less impressive for this. She may have offered a model for  lfthryth, whose first husband hailed from East Anglia. Another likely inspiration was Eadgifu, wife of Edward the Elder. Little is known about Eadgifu during her husband s reign, but when her sons Edmund (r939 46) and Eadred (r946 55) ruled, she seems to have been the power behind the throne.",
        "target_summary": "While medieval queens like Eleanor of Aquitaine and Elizabeth Woodville often capture historical imagination, few recall the profoundly significant Ælfthryth, King Edgar's third wife (959–75) and mother of Æthelred the Unready. Her relative obscurity is understandable, given the scarcity of sources from the Anglo-Saxon \"Dark Ages\" that preceded the Norman Conquest of 1066. Yet, Ælfthryth truly deserves greater recognition, for she holds the singular honour of being \"the first queen of England,\" a title earned through her transformative impact on royal womanhood.\n\nBorn into a powerful family in the mid-940s, Ælfthryth's initial marriage to the influential ealdorman Æthelwold ended mysteriously, paving the way for her pivotal union with King Edgar in 964. This marriage marked an unprecedented shift in royal status. Unlike Edgar's previous consorts, who were simply \"king's wives,\" Ælfthryth was consistently styled \"queen\" from the very beginning. She transcended a merely decorative role, actively appearing in government records and influencing royal policy, signaling a profound redefinition of a royal consort's position.\n\nHer most significant departure from tradition was becoming the first English royal consort to be formally crowned and consecrated. This sacred ritual, drawing on continental practices and involving an anointing with holy oil and investment with symbols of office, had previously been reserved solely for kings. Elevating queenship into a distinct office, this ceremony bestowed upon Ælfthryth a divine legitimacy, meaning her influence stemmed not only from her husband but also from \"divine grace\"—a powerful concept that irrevocably reshaped the perception of queens in England. Her partnership with Edgar was evident in their joint efforts to implement ecclesiastical reforms and her prominent presence beside him at his grand second coronation in 973.\n\nEdgar's sudden death in 975, at just 32, plunged the kingdom into a fierce succession crisis. Ælfthryth vehemently championed her young son, Æthelred, against Edward, Edgar's elder son. Her powerful standing as a consecrated queen likely fueled her conviction that Æthelred, as the son of the \"only true consort,\" possessed greater legitimacy. Although Edward initially ascended the throne, his subsequent assassination at Corfe, shortly after taking power, cast suspicion upon Ælfthryth and her zealous supporters. While contemporary sources do not directly implicate her, it is widely believed that fervent adherents, perhaps exceeding their orders, acted to secure Æthelred's ascent.\n\nWith Æthelred, still a child, now king, Ælfthryth swiftly established an informal regency, governing with quiet efficiency for six years. Though she experienced a temporary period out of favour during Æthelred's youthful rebellion, a national crisis triggered by renewed Viking raids prompted his reconciliation with his mother. Ælfthryth returned to court, her influence restored, even undertaking the crucial responsibility of raising his children, the future heirs. Her death in 1001 deeply moved Æthelred, who honored her memory with an extraordinary document, reflecting her profound impact.\n\nÆlfthryth's legacy is undeniable. She fundamentally transformed the status of royal women, laying the groundwork for powerful successors like Emma of Normandy. By pioneering the first royal coronation and consecration for a queen, she established the independent \"office of queen,\" setting a template that would shape the long and distinguished history of English monarchy. Drawing inspiration from earlier influential figures like Æthelflæd, the \"Lady of the Mercians,\" Ælfthryth emerges from the shadows of early medieval history as a pivotal figure whose innovations irrevocably altered the course of English queenship.",

(AKG) Ad 4 May 1926: The General Strike fails to paralyse Britain To many people, the first full day of the General Strike on 4 May 1926 represented a turning point in history. After years of mounting tension between employers and unions, particularly in the coal industry, the Trades Union Congress finally ordered its members out. On that first morning, docks, factories and rail yards across the country stood empty and silent. Conservative newspapers warned that this would mark the beginning of a Bolshevik revolution. In Blackburn, one man later remembered, his family  sat in silence in the kitchen, holding their breath, waiting for the revolution to begin . Across the country, a strange sense of unreality took hold. With public transport having ground to a halt, the roads were packed.  The mill chimneys ceased to smoke and the wheels ceased to turn,  one woman in Manchester wrote afterwards.  The pavement and even the roads were crowded with pedestrians and the drivers of private cars offered lifts with surprising generosity.  Reports of fighting came from the docks, while the government deployed troops to escort food convoys. Yet the widely predicted class warfare failed to materialise, and the General Strike never evolved into a revolutionary uprising. Indeed, compared with turbulence overseas, it turned into a bit of a non-event. By the time it fizzled out nine days later, King George V   who had upbraided his Conservative ministers for their attitude to the strikers ( Try living on their wages before you judge them )   considered it a tribute to British unity.  Our dear old country can be well proud of itself,  he wrote in his diary.  It shows what a wonderful people we are.  6 May 1527: The army of the Holy Roman Emperor sacks Rome In the early 16th century, Italy was a dangerous place to live. Torn apart by endless wars between the French king, Francis I, and his bitter rival, Charles V, king of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, the peninsula had become a byword for massacres, plunder and rapine. But nothing made a greater impression on the European imagination than what happened on 6 May 1527, the day the imperial army hurled itself on Rome. The sack of Rome was never part of Charles V s plan. His troops had already beaten the French; the problem was that funds had run short   so the imperial army s commander, the Duke of Bourbon, had effectively lost control over his own men. Only by promising them loot from the capture of Rome did the duke manage to prevent a full-scale mutiny. And so it was that on 6 May, at least 20,000 imperial soldiers began their assault. Disastrously, the duke, wearing his trademark white cloak, was shot and killed almost immediately   and any semblance of discipline disappeared. What followed was an orgy of plunder and vandalism as the imperial army swept aside the feeble resistance and rampaged through the city. Inside the Vatican, the Swiss Guard made a desperate last stand as Pope Clement VII escaped to the Castel Sant Angelo. They were slaughtered where they stood, their captain cut down in full view of his watching wife. Meanwhile, imperial troops were ransacking churches, tombs and cemeteries. In all, at least 12,000 people were estimated to have been murdered.  The Germans were bad,  said one churchman.  The Italians were worse; the Spanish were the worst.  6 May 1840: The Penny Black revolutionises communications in Britain Rowland Hill had a vision. While a small boy in Kidderminster, he had watched in embarrassment as his mother scrabbled for money to pay the postman. By the 1830s, Hill, now a teacher and social reformer, was determined to push through a change that he believed would transform the Post Office into a force for progress: universal penny postage, paid in advance. By May 1840, Hill s scheme was up and running. As he explained, people would prove that they had paid by using  a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp, and covered at the back with a glutinous wash, which the bringer might, by applying a little moisture, attach to the back of the letter . He enlisted the Royal Mint s chief engraver to create a memorable image   a picture of Queen Victoria. Today we know his creation as the Penny Black. The first stamps went on sale on 1 May, and the system came into operation five days later. One schoolboy recalled that he did not  fancy making my mouth a glue pot,  while the newssheet The Town ran a saucy poem:  You must kiss our fair Queen, or her pictures, that s clear. Or the gummy medallion will never adhere. You will not kiss her hand, you will readily find But actually kiss little Vicky s behind.  The Penny Black was an instant hit. Within a week the presses were working round the clock producing 600,000 stamps a day. The stamp had become an icon, a symbol of national pride: an image of Britannia itself. The world s first adhesive postage stamp was the brainchild of teacher and social reformer Rowland Hill. (Mary Evans) 14 May 1264: Montfort crushes Henry III s hapless army at Lewes In the long list of royal catastrophes, the battle of Lewes holds an especially ignominious place. Like his father, the ill-starred John, Henry III had spent decades feuding with his barons while attempting to raise money. In particular, he found himself pitted against the ruthless Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who was determined to uphold the principles of Magna Carta and secure more power for England s magnates. Both sides had begun preparing for war in the early 1260s, but it was not until 14 May 1264 that their armies clashed in earnest. Montfort had cornered the royal army in the Sussex town of Lewes. The night before battle was joined, the barons  leader slept not a wink, preferring instead to give his time  to divine offices and prayers and exhorting his men to make sincere confessions . Montfort need not have worried. When battle commenced the following day, the royal troops  lack of discipline proved fatal. Though the king s son, the future Edward I, led a stirring cavalry charge that broke his enemy s left wing, he was unable to rally his men back to their positions. In the confusion, Montfort s men crushed the rest of the king s army. Henry himself   who was almost 50 years old   fought bravely, but to no avail. By evening, he and his son had retreated to Lewes Priory, and the following day they formally surrendered to Simon de Montfort. It was one of the most humiliating moments in Plantagenet history. 16 May 1900: Mafeking is relieved The Boer War began disastrously for Britain. The autumn of 1899 saw one defeat after another, while at Mafeking, on the border between British-held Cape Colony and the Transvaal, some 1,500 British troops were surrounded by a far larger Boer army. On 12 October the telegraph lines were cut; four days later the first Boer shells landed in the dusty little town. Yet for more than 200 days, the defenders held out. Inspired by their commander, Colonel Robert Baden-Powell, they not only laid fake landmines and mounted daring diversionary attacks, but always made time for Sunday cricket matches. In Britain, the valiant resistance of the Mafeking defenders gripped the public imagination. By May 1900, with a relief column on its way, it seemed that everybody was waiting for news of victory. And, at last, it came. Late on the evening of 16 May, the defenders heard firing to the north. At about 7.30pm, seven British cavalrymen rode into the town. As they paused, tired and dusty, a passer-by said casually:  Oh yes, I heard you were knocking about.  The main relief column arrived in Mafeking just before four o clock next morning. By then, crowds had poured into the streets, filled with unbridled joy.  One man tried to speak; then he swore; then he buried his face in his arms and sobbed,  wrote a watching reporter. But that was as nothing compared with the reaction back home: a week s worth of hysterical rejoicing ensued, complete with street parties and fireworks. The defenders of Mafeking, wrote the author FT Stevens,  carried themselves like Britons of the old breed  and because they played the game and played up well, and played to the end, and by the will of God have won, we honour them and count the country richer this day for them.  16 May 1703: Peter the Great founds his namesake city Even by the standards of Russia s colourful history, the foundation of St Petersburg makes an extraordinary story. In May 1703, the dynamic young emperor Peter the Great had cut his way through Swedish forces to the Baltic coastline. His eye was drawn to a small island at the mouth of the river Neva where Finnish fishermen had built a few wooden huts. The story goes that Peter borrowed a bayonet to cut two strips of turf, which he laid in the shape of a cross.  Here,  he proclaimed,  shall be a town.  The first stone was laid on 16 May (27 May in the Gregorian calendar.) Whether or not this story is true, Peter s ambition was astounding. The cold, marshy conditions could hardly have been less propitious, and he was still fighting the Swedes. Yet by the end of May his men had built a small log house for Peter, and by year s end they had finished a great hexagonal citadel, the Peter and Paul Fortress, which still stands today. Yet the birth of St Petersburg did not come without a horrendous cost. The Swedes launched fresh attacks each year, but the biggest problems were caused by the conditions. Draining the marshes demanded almost superhuman effort; men poured into the site from as far afield as Finland, Siberia and Ukraine. They lived in primitive, crowded, dirty hovels; many died from dysentery, scurvy or malaria. St Petersburg, men said, was a  city built on bones . But it endured. Indeed, nothing better symbolises Peter s vision than the gleaming, soaring gold spire of the Peter and Paul Cathedral. Work began on it in 1712; by the time it was completed in 1733, Peter was long dead. His city, though, lives on. This rather romantic depiction of the founding of St Petersburg was painted in 1838 by Alexei Gavrilovich Venetsianov. (Superstock) 24 May 1487: Lambert Simnel is crowned king in Dublin In the spring of 1487, Henry VII sat uneasily on his throne. It was less than two years since he had taken the crown by force at Bosworth, and he had already put down one Yorkist uprising. But then, at the end of May 1487, word reached Henry that the worst had happened. A Yorkist pretender claiming to be the young Earl of Warwick had been crowned king in Dublin, and an Irish army was on its way to England. In reality, as Henry knew perfectly well, Warwick was safely locked in the Tower of London. The imposter was a tradesman s son, 10-year-old Lambert Simnel (though this name is doubtful). He had been groomed by a Yorkist priest called Richard Symonds, who put it about that Warwick had escaped from the Tower and was now under his guidance. The priest then sailed to Ireland and presented young Simnel to the lord deputy, the Earl of Kildare, who was no fan of Henry VII. Kildare was also not a fool, and almost certainly knew that Simnel was an imposter   but the prospect of playing kingmaker was too tempting to resist. On 24 May, Simnel was paraded through the streets of Dublin. At the Priory of the Holy Trinity, later Christ Church Cathedral, he was crowned king of England with a gold circlet borrowed from a statue of the Virgin Mary. Afterwards he was carried through the streets on the back of a giant Irishman, one D Arcy of Platten. But the plot soon began to unravel. When the rebels met Henry s forces at Stoke Field in Nottinghamshire, the result was utter disaster for the Irish troops. For little Lambert Simnel, though, there was a surprisingly happy ending. Showing unexpected mercy, Henry gave him a job in his kitchens. Simnel reputedly later became a falconer, dying peacefully in his bed during the reign of Henry VIII. Lambert Simnel is depicted as the  Knight of the Golden Tulip  on a 17th-century playing card. (Bridgeman Art) 25 May 1895: Oscar Wilde is convicted Oscar Wilde s decision to launch a libel action against the Marquess of Queensberry, who had accused him of  posing somdomite [sic] , was the most unfortunate he ever made. The trial opened on 3 April 1895 and almost immediately it was obvious that Wilde was in deep trouble. When the defence announced that they had found several male prostitutes who would testify that they had had sex with Wilde, the playwright dropped the case   but, even as he left the courtroom, the authorities were drawing up a warrant for his arrest on charges of gross indecency. At Wilde s first trial, which opened on 26 April, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Three weeks later, a second trial began at the Old Bailey, prosecuted by the Liberal government s solicitor general, Sir Frank Lockwood. Wilde wrote later that Lockwood had issued an  appalling denunciation   like something out of Tacitus, like a passage in Dante, like one of Savonarola s indictments of the popes of Rome . This was an exaggeration: by the standards of the day, Lockwood s closing statement was remarkably restrained. But it is easy to understand why Wilde was so distraught. On 25 May, the foreman announced the jury s verdict: guilty. There were cries of  Shame!  from the gallery, and Wilde turned grey with horror.  It is no use for me to address you. People who can do these things must be dead to all sense of shame, and one cannot hope to produce any effect upon them. It is the worst case I have ever tried,  said Mr Justice Wills, who sentenced Wilde to two years of hard labour. It was, he added,  the severest sentence that the law allows. In my judgment it is totally inadequate for a case such as this.  Other notable May anniversaries 3 May 1849: In Dresden, Saxony, pro-democracy protesters launch the ill-fated May Uprising, often considered the last of the 1848 revolutions. After six days of pitched street battles, the revolt is put down. 12 May 1364: After winning approval from the pope, the Polish king Casimir III issues a charter for his country s first higher education institution, the Jagiellonian University (shown below)   the second-oldest university in central Europe. 15 May 1982: Attacked by Argentine Skyhawk aircraft off the coast of the Falkland Islands, the British destroyer HMS Coventry is sunk. The attack takes the lives of 20 crew. 19 May 1536: Charged with adultery, incest and treason, Henry VIII s second wife, the enigmatic Anne Boleyn, is executed at the Tower of London. 26 May 1805: Napoleon claims the title of king of Italy and is crowned with the medieval Iron Crown of Lombardy in Milan s magnificent cathedral. 30 May 1966: NASA launches the rocket carrying lunar lander Surveyor 1; three days later, it lands on the moon (pictured below). It is the first American spacecraft to land on an extra-terrestrial body, paving the way for the moon landing three years later. Ad Dominic Sandbrook is a historian and broadcaster.",
        "target_summary": "Across the annals of history, May emerges as a month punctuated by both profound shifts and dramatic upheavals, from the barbaric sack of an ancient city to the quiet launch of a communication revolution.\n\nOn **6 May 1527**, Rome suffered a catastrophic assault from an unpaid, uncontrollable imperial army. Their commander, the Duke of Bourbon, could only avert mutiny by promising his 20,000 soldiers the city's riches. The duke's immediate death in the assault shattered all discipline, unleashing an unbridled orgy of plunder and destruction. Imperial troops ravaged the city, slaughtering the Swiss Guard at the Vatican as Pope Clement VII barely escaped. Churches, tombs, and homes were desecrated, and approximately 12,000 lives extinguished, leaving an indelible scar on European memory – a testament to brutal, chaotic warfare.\n\nDecades of simmering industrial tension erupted into Britain's General Strike on **4 May 1926**, sparking fears of revolution. As docks, factories, and rail yards fell silent nationwide, conservative media warned of a Bolshevik uprising. An eerie unreality gripped the country: public transport ceased, factory chimneys stood cold, yet roads filled with pedestrians and surprising acts of generosity. Despite government troop deployments, the anticipated class warfare never materialized. After nine days, the strike quietly dissipated, becoming a \"non-event\" compared to global turmoil. King George V, who empathized with the workers, ultimately hailed it as a profound testament to British unity.\n\nThe age of modern communication dawned on **6 May 1840** with Rowland Hill's revolutionary Penny Black. Haunted by childhood postal payment woes, Hill, a visionary reformer, conceived of universal penny postage paid in advance via a small, adhesive 'bit of paper.' Adorned with Queen Victoria's portrait, the world's first postage stamp became an instant sensation. Despite initial humorous trepidation over its \"glutinous wash,\" presses soon churned out 600,000 stamps daily. More than a convenience, the Penny Black swiftly became a cherished icon and a proud symbol of British ingenuity.\n\nA pivotal, humiliating chapter in Plantagenet history unfolded on **14 May 1264**, at the Battle of Lewes. For years, King Henry III had clashed with his barons, notably the formidable Simon de Montfort, a staunch defender of Magna Carta. Cornered at Lewes, Montfort's devout preparations preceded a decisive clash where the royal army's fatal indiscipline proved its undoing. Despite a spirited cavalry charge by Prince Edward, Montfort's forces ruthlessly crushed the disarrayed king's army. Henry and Edward were forced to retreat, enduring the ultimate humiliation the following day: formal surrender to Simon de Montfort.\n\nThe enduring siege of Mafeking, a beacon of British tenacity during the disastrous early Boer War, finally broke on **16 May 1900**. For over 200 days, 1,500 troops under Colonel Robert Baden-Powell bravely withstood a vastly superior Boer force, their ingenious tactics and even Sunday cricket captivating the public. As the nation held its breath for news of relief, it arrived late on the 16th – seven dusty cavalrymen met with an understated welcome. By dawn, unbridled joy erupted in Mafeking's streets, a prelude to a week of hysterical national celebrations, hailing the defenders' resilience.\n\nOn **16 May 1703**, Russia's audacious young emperor, Peter the Great, literally broke ground for a new city. Having fought his way to the Baltic, Peter, with a legendary cut of turf on a marshy Neva island, declared, \"Here, shall be a town.\" Against all odds – ongoing war and an unforgiving environment – his ambition knew no bounds. Within months, a log house and the mighty Peter and Paul Fortress emerged. Yet, St Petersburg's birth came at horrific human cost; a \"city built on bones\" as countless laborers perished. Though Peter himself died before its gleaming gold spire rose, his magnificent city endured.\n\nHenry VII's precarious throne faced a brazen challenge on **24 May 1487**, when ten-year-old Lambert Simnel, a tradesman's son, was crowned 'king' in Dublin. This audacious Yorkist plot, orchestrated by a cunning priest, claimed Simnel was the escaped Earl of Warwick – a deception Henry knew to be false. Nevertheless, the ambitious Earl of Kildare embraced the charade. Simnel, adorned with a circlet, was paraded through Dublin. Yet, this improbable rebellion swiftly crumbled at Stoke Field. In a remarkable twist of clemency, young Simnel was spared, finding a new life first in the king's kitchens, then as a falconer.\n\nOn **25 May 1895**, Oscar Wilde plummeted from literary eminence into a public abyss, convicted of \"gross indecency.\" His tragic downfall began with an ill-fated libel suit against the Marquess of Queensberry, whose accusation of \"posing somdomite\" swiftly backfired. As the defense revealed witnesses, Wilde abandoned his case, only to be immediately arrested. After a hung jury in the first trial, a second, intensely publicized Old Bailey trial sealed his fate. The \"guilty\" verdict on May 25th plunged Wilde into horror. Justice Wills delivered a scathing condemnation, sentencing him to two years hard labor, crushing the flamboyant writer.\n\nMay's historical tapestry features other pivotal moments: The valiant Dresden May Uprising, a final gasp of the 1848 revolutions, was brutally suppressed on **3 May 1849**. Poland's academic future was forged on **12 May 1364** with the founding of the prestigious Jagiellonian University. A somber note sounds on **19 May 1536**, with the tragic execution of the enigmatic Anne Boleyn. Imperial ambition shone bright on **26 May 1805** as Napoleon claimed the Iron Crown of Italy. A cosmic leap occurred on **30 May 1966**, with America's first lunar landing via Surveyor 1. Lastly, modern conflict brought tragedy on **15 May 1982**, as HMS Coventry was lost in the Falklands War, claiming 20 lives.",

        "content": "When Charles IV of France died without a son in 1328, Charles s first cousin was chosen to succeed, becoming King Philip VI. Yet Edward III of England, as the deceased king s nearest male relation, was considered by some to have the stronger claim. When Phillip VI confiscated the duchy of Aquitaine from England in 1337, Edward III responded by pressing his claim to the French throne, beginning the Hundred Years  War. The conflict saw major developments in military strategy and technology and the final French victory at Castillon in 1453 was the first major field engagement of the war to be decided by gunfire. Here, historian David Green, author of The Hundred Years War: A People's History, shares seven lesser-known facts about the series of conflicts  Ad A Hundred Years  War? The first thing anyone usually learns about the Hundred Years  War is that it did not last 100 years. Tradition dates it from 1337 to 1453, but in some ways it is more helpful to view this longest of European wars as one phase of an even longer struggle between England and France, stretching perhaps from the Norman Conquest of 1066 until the 1904 Entente Cordiale [a series of agreements signed between Great Britain and France that marked the end of hundreds of years of intermittent conflict between the two states.] Conflict with the  ancient enemy  has shaped the identities of both countries, and memories of the war remain long on both sides of the Channel. Charles de Gaulle remarked in June 1962:  Our greatest hereditary enemy was not Germany, it was England. From the Hundred Years  War to Fashoda, she hardly ceased to struggle against us  she is not naturally inclined to wish us well.  V for Victory? The legend that the origins of the  v  sign can be found in the Hundred Years  War is, sadly, just legendary. There are no contemporary sources that suggest English archers, as an insult, raised to the French the two fingers with which they drew their longbows, nor that the French dismembered captured archers   removing those same fingers and thus preventing them from ever firing a bow again. There is, however, an account of the French  mooning  a detachment of English troops during the campaign that led to the battle of Cr cy. This so enraged the English that they launched an ill-advised attack on a well-defended position and were beaten back with heavy losses. Battle of Cr cy, 26 August 1346. Hand-coloured later. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Total war? We are often told that  total war  is a sad product of the modern, industrial age. It is, however, difficult to find any section of English or French society that was not affected by the Hundred Years  War. The peasantry in both countries, for example, were central to the war effort and suffered greatly as a consequence. Indeed, its members were targeted directly: because of the connection between taxation (paid chiefly by the peasantry) and military defence, the status of  non-combatants  became very uncertain during the war. So, by attacking taxpayers, the English also attacked French military resources. Furthermore, as the war unfolded it became a consciously  national  struggle and, consequently, there were few reasons non-combatants should be immune from its effects. This policy and its brutally sophisticated implementation are clear from a letter written in 1355 by Sir John Wingfield, who served in the retinue of Edward the Black Prince (1330 76):  | This medieval  apocalypse  left a legacy no one saw coming It seems certain that since the war against the French king began, there has never been such destruction in a region as in this raid. For the countryside and towns which have been destroyed... produced more revenue for the king of France in aid of his war than half his kingdom  as I could prove from authentic documents found in various towns in the tax-collectors  houses. Wingfield served as  governor of the prince s business  (essentially his business manager), and he wrote in the aftermath of the so-called grande chevauch e (a raid across southern France in which an army of around 6,000 soldiers destroyed 500 settlements of various sorts   villages, castles, towns, hamlets - and may have devastated up to 18,000 square kilometres of territory). The Black Prince, however, was not content merely to orchestrate and witness the destruction, he wished to determine its exact extent, and so he brought officials such as Wingfield with him to calculate the precise cost to the French treasury. The psychological cost of this sort of raiding   the fear and insecurity it surely engendered   is more difficult to measure, but as the war drew on in France the ringing of church bells might as easily mean an impending raid as a call to prayer. Rituals at the battle of Agincourt The battle of Agincourt began at about 11am on 25 October 1415 (the feast day of Saints Crispin and Crispian). It had not been a pleasant night: heavy rain had turned the ploughed field between the two armies into something approaching a quagmire. The English and French forces had deployed in the cold before dawn, and hours had passed without either side making any move. Finally, King Henry V (r1413 22) ordered an advance. But before they moved forward, a fascinating and seemingly extraordinary act took place: each man knelt   archers and men-at-arms alike   kissed the ground, and took a little earth in his mouth. This collective and yet deeply personal ritual seems to have been sacramental; a ceremony that combined elements of the Eucharist with the burial service. It served as a blessing, a purification, and a preparation for death. Throughout the Anglo-French war, battles had enormous religious and symbolic significance. Not only was victory or defeat an indication of divine judgement, but for many it might bring one decidedly closer to divine judgement of a very personal nature. The battle of Agincourt, 25 October 1415, (1910).

Shakespeare would have us believe that in 1415 the English were outnumbered at least 10-to-one. Such a number was shaped by dramatic necessity and also by various contemporary and near-contemporary English sources that suggested the French army totalled between 60,000 and 160,000 men. Such numbers are patently absurd given what we know of the possibilities of military recruitment at this time; they were grossly inflated with the aim of exaggerating the scale of Henry s victory. Recent work makes it clear that the Valois army was considerably more modest in size, perhaps 20,000 30,000 troops. And, indeed, in her 2005 account of the battle, Anne Curry argues that the French army was smaller still, numbering no more than 12,000 soldiers. By comparison, Henry commanded between 6,000 and 9,000 soldiers   the anonymous author of the Gesta Henrici Quinti (The Deeds of Henry V), who witnessed the battle, suggested he led 5,000 archers and around 1,000 men-at-arms (although the numbering is not precise). The French, therefore, outnumbered the English by two to one, but probably no more. We few, we happy few: part two Some other aspects of Shakespeare s account of the battle closely accord with contemporary accounts, and there is good reason to believe them to be accurate. When Sir Walter Hungerford (1378 1449) bemoaned the lack of archers in his company, Henry is said (again by the author of the Gesta Henrici Quinti) to have reprimanded him in a speech remarkably similar to that familiar from Shakespeare:  That is a foolish way to talk , the king said,  because by God in Heaven  I would not, even if I could, have a single man more than I do. For these I have here with me are God s people  Do you not believe that the Almighty, with these His humble few, is able to overcome the opposing arrogance of the French . Guns and gunpowder The Hundred Years  War saw some major developments in military strategy and technology. Indeed, some historians have argued that these changes amount to a  military revolution . Among such developments, the evolution of gunpowder weaponry was particularly significant. That evolutionary process was, however, a slow one. At Agincourt, for example, it appears that French artillery accounted for a solitary English archer during the battle, and in 1431 Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, fired 412 cannonballs into the town of Lagny and succeeded only in killing a chicken. Nonetheless, as the war entered its final phase such weapons were becoming increasingly effective. They played important roles in a number of Joan of Arc s battles and sieges, and the  Maid  was considered particularly adept in aiming the weapons. Then, in the late 1430s, Charles VII (1422 61) took steps to put in place a professional artillery train under the command of the Bureau brothers   John, the king s Master Gunner, and his brother, Gaspard. Thereafter, the weapons available to the French grew in number and efficiency, and they proved their worth in successive sieges. Gunpowder weapons allowed the French to eject the English from Normandy and Gascony with astonishing speed. In 1437, the castle of Castelnau-de-Cern s in Gascony was  broken down... by cannon and engines, and a great part of the walls were thrown to the ground . In some cases, as at Bourg in 1451, the mere presence of guns was sufficient to bring about an immediate surrender. Around this time, gunpowder weapons also began to be used effectively as field artillery. Formigny in 1450 (a decisive victory for the French) may have been the first battle decided by gunpowder artillery. The engagement began with a cavalry assault on the English infantry and longbowmen, which was repulsed. Soon afterwards, however, the Bureau brothers arrived with two breechloading culverins on wheeled carriages. These were capable of a high rate of fire and could outdistance the English archers. Although it required the arrival of further reinforcements to decide the battle, the artillery clearly played a telling role. This was also the case at Castillon in 1453 (a decisive French victory), the final engagement of the Hundred Years  War. This was, undoubtedly, determined by artillery, and, as a consequence, the battle marks a deeply significant point in the history of European warfare.

        "target_summary": "The Hundred Years' War, ignited in 1337 by a French succession crisis, saw Edward III of England press his claim to the French throne against Philip VI, escalating after the confiscation of Aquitaine. The protracted conflict, concluding decisively with a French victory at Castillon in 1453, profoundly reshaped military strategy and technology.\n\nThough traditionally dated from 1337 to 1453, historian David Green suggests viewing this lengthy struggle as part of an even longer, foundational rivalry between England and France, stretching from the Norman Conquest to the 1904 Entente Cordiale. This enduring competition indelibly molded the national identities of both countries, leaving a deep historical imprint vividly recalled by Charles de Gaulle in 1962, who declared England France's \"greatest hereditary enemy.\"\n\nDispelling popular myths, the \"V for victory\" sign's defiant origins are not found in medieval archers. However, the war's \"total\" nature, often mistakenly attributed solely to modern eras, deeply permeated medieval life. The conflict indiscriminately affected all societal strata, particularly the peasantry, who bore the brutal brunt of taxation and became direct military targets. Edward the Black Prince's devastating \"grande chevauchée\" in 1355, meticulously documented by Sir John Wingfield, exemplified this brutal strategy. This campaign systematically destroyed 500 settlements and vast territories, not merely to inflict damage but to precisely calculate and cripple French economic resources, sowing widespread terror through psychological warfare where the ringing of church bells might signal an impending raid as much as a call to prayer.\n\nBefore the iconic Battle of Agincourt in 1415, English soldiers performed a fascinating, deeply personal ritual: kneeling to kiss the muddy ground and taking earth into their mouths. This sacramental act, combining elements of Eucharist and burial, served as a profound blessing, purification, and preparation for inevitable death, underscoring the era's pervasive belief in divine judgment through victory or defeat.\n\nShakespeare's dramatic portrayal of Agincourt's troop numbers, claiming a staggering 10-to-one French advantage, is a powerful but ultimately inflated narrative. More accurate historical accounts suggest the French army, though still formidable, outnumbered the English by a realistic two-to-one margin. Yet, King Henry V's inspirational address, reassuring his men that God fights for His \"humble few\" against French arrogance, remarkably echoes contemporary records, highlighting the psychological power of leadership in the face of daunting odds.\n\nThe Hundred Years' War truly catalyzed a \"military revolution,\" most notably through the evolving role of gunpowder weaponry. Initially crude and comically inefficient – a cannonball might kill only a chicken or a solitary archer – these innovations gradually transformed the battlefield. Under Charles VII, a professional artillery train, expertly commanded by the Bureau brothers, became devastatingly effective. These new weapons rapidly expelled the English from Normandy and Gascony, shattering castle walls and often compelling immediate surrender through their mere presence. Gunpowder artillery proved decisive in field engagements like Formigny in 1450 and, conclusively, at Castillon in 1453, marking a pivotal and irreversible shift in the history of European warfare.",

        "title": "Why  Bad King John  was actually good",
        "content": "One might have hoped that the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta would have provided at least some oxygen to the argument that  Bad King John  was perhaps not too  Bad  after all; and   whisper it   that in some ways this traditionally most maligned of monarchs was perhaps really rather Good. Ad Instead, the anticipated tsunami of popular and learned articles collectively assert, inter alia, that King John was at once cruel and coercive, treacherous and tyrannical, pusillanimous and pitiful, lazy and lackluster. For the large part it seems that, 800 years later, opinion has broadly backed Matthew Paris, the 13th-century chronicler who alleged that John s greatest achievement was, by dying, to make yet more foul the existing foulness of Hell: John was not only Bad; he was diabolical. Popular understanding of Magna Carta has significantly stunted debate on the nature and achievement of John. Magna Carta, we are told, stands for the rule of law. Invoked by those in 17th-century England who sought to thwart the allegedly despotic tendencies of Charles I, and latterly employed by the American Revolutionaries in their making of the United States Bill of Rights in 1789, Magna Carta has become totemic of the liberties by which western societies identify themselves. Indeed, this tendency has travelled so far that Magna Carta has, according to G Hindley,  acquired an almost mystic incantatory quality . This, he claims, is partly evidenced by the fact that the government  the Magna Carta 800th anniversary website, which currently asserts that Magna Carta  is the foundation stone supporting the freedoms enjoyed today by hundreds of millions of people in more than 100 countries . These are powerful words, and it follows that if John ignored Magna Carta   which he did   then it must surely be the case that he was indeed malign. The ever-growing extent to which Magna Carta is celebrated and elevated necessarily means that, in equal and opposite degree, the reputation of John is tarnished and diminished. In this context, to argue that John was anything other than  Bad  seems inappropriate and somewhat unbelievable. However, the Magna Carta that John chose to ignore did not purport to be a constitutional document adumbrating and guaranteeing liberties to all English people. The Magna Carta of 1215 (it is important to realise that there were many reissues of Magna Carta after the reign of John, each different to the one presented to John) is better understood as a set of flawed peace terms designed to heal the incipient civil war between John and an element of rebellious barons. In order to try and bind John to their terms, the barons insisted that John accept a committee of 25 of their number empowered to police and enforce Magna Carta by seizing John s castles and assets when he was judged   by them, and against criteria put forth by them   to have transgressed. No medieval monarch could have accepted for any length of time the Magna Carta of 1215, for it clearly rendered the king a phantom of a monarch. Indeed, so extreme was this impact that it is not beyond sensible contemplation that the ambition of the rebel barons was not to obtain a lasting peace, but instead absolutely to provoke John to break the newly agreed terms so that they could seize his largesse. John did indeed overturn Magna Carta, but arguably any medieval monarch would have done the same. The Magna Carta of 1215 is not the Magna Carta of popular imagination. The Barons compelling King John to ratify Magna Carta. (The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Popular representations of events at Runnymede in June 1215 would also have us believe that leading rebel barons such as Eustace de Vesci and Robert Fitzwalter were revered freedom fighters. In fact, they are better understood as tight-knuckled, low browed feudal reactionaries kicking against John s increasingly efficacious administration. A considerable body of evidence in the form of pipe rolls, charters and letters patent indicates strongly that John was highly effective   perhaps too effective   in mobilizing the resources of his kingdom and in imposing the royal will upon the population at large. This apparently incontestable evidence shows John to have been possessed of vigour and vim, constantly on the move enforcing Angevin aspirations. Ironically, the very fact that John faced rebellion in 1215 is itself indicative of the fact that his government had bite as well as bark. Moreover, even though chronicle sources allege that the whole of the baronage was united against John, this was clearly not the case   not least because there would have been no possibility of civil war if there had not been two sides, each with the wherewithal to resist the other. Indeed, by the spring of 1215, it has been estimated that of England s 197 baronies only 39 were in active opposition to the king, with perhaps the same number acting in his support. Nor is it true that John antagonized elements of the baronage because he was lacking in martial prowess, or that the king was  Softsword , as the chroniclers assert. His reluctance to commit to pitched battles was entirely conventional in an age when all leaders preferred to avoid them   John s arch-enemy, Philip Augustus, King of France (r1180 1223) shied away from a setpiece battle at least as frequently as his protagonist. We should not mistake John s military caution for cowardice. Instead, John prosecuted siege warfare with the sort of energy, determination and success that is usually only spoken of in reference to Henry II and Richard I. Thus, we see him, for example, razing the walls and castle of Le Mans in 1200, assaulting the forces besieging Mirebeau in 1202 (having covered a distance of 80 miles in 48 hours), marching upon Montauban in 1206 and pressing the siege of Rochester castle in 1215   an event that the leading authority of castles and castle warfare in this period considers was  the greatest operation in England up to that time  (RA Brown). John was also an effective strategist. His plan to relieve the siege of Chateau-Gaillard in 1203 by arranging a simultaneous assault from land and amphibious forces has been described as  a masterpiece of ingenuity by K Norgate. Even John s much-criticised twin-pronged invasion of France in 1214 (which culminated in the disastrous battle of Bouvines on 27 July 1214) achieved its basic aim of dividing the Capetian forces. John s alleged lasciviousness and acts of cruelty have been presented as further character traits that antagonised the barons and thus prevented him from delivering strong kingship. Lusting after the wives and daughters of those men he relied upon to deliver the royal command was no doubt a problem in a world where private relationships were the stuff of high politics. Yet nearly all medieval kings took mistresses. Indeed, William the Conqueror s loyalty to his wife, Matilda, was the subject of perplexed comment. If John was indeed a  smutty minded groper  (CJ Tyerman), he remained a rake rather than a rogue. His marriage to Isabella of Angouleme when she was unlikely to have been more than 15 and quite possibly as young as nine has prompted a flood of accusations that John was a 13th-century Humbert Humbert. Yet marriage at an early age was commonplace at the time   a survey of the marriage arrangements of John s contemporaries leads to the conclusion that the Angevin king had an eye for an older women! Isabella of Angouleme, queen consort of King John. (The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Further contextual analysis also diminishes the charge that John was a perverted purveyor of acts of cruelty. The evidence does not permit John to be charged definitively with killing his nephew, Arthur, but the king nevertheless had arguably legitimate reasons to undertake such an act since Arthur (a 16-year-old boy) had put himself at the head of a rebellion  by Philip Augustus. Similarly, it is not proven that John starved Matilda de Braose and her son to death in Corfe Castle, but if he did so it was because of her refusal to offer her sons as hostages in order to trim the rebellious behaviour of their father. Yet hostage taking was part-and-parcel of medieval government, and as such it follows that they sometimes paid the ultimate price. Indeed, King Stephen was seen as weak for refusing to hang the son of Marshal when the latter broke the terms of an agreement with the king. If John is guilty of cruelty, then what of Richard I in 1191 when, following a dispute about the terms upon which Acre had been surrendered, he ordered the killing of 2,700 Muslim prisoners? What of Henry V, who during the battle of Agincourt in 1415 ordered the killing of several thousand French prisoners? What of John s father, Henry II who, having taken 22 hostages from the Welsh in 1165, ordered that the males among them   some of them sons of princes   be blinded and castrated, and that the females should have their noses and ears cut off? Medieval monarchs were expected to be fierce, and John fulfilled those expectations. The Barnwell annalist, Walter Of Coventry, concluded that John  was indeed a great prince but less than successful [and that] he met with both kinds of luck . John was certainly unlucky in that his reign coincided with probably the two most accomplished leaders of the Middle Ages   Philip Augustus and Pope Innocent III (r1198 1216)   and he was certainly unlucky in that the Angevin  empire  he had inherited in 1199 was increasingly ungovernable and assaulted by fissiparous tendencies. Yet, I argue, he was not  less than successful . John s achievement is that he held things together for as long as he did. Ad Graham Seel is head of history at St Paul s School in London.

        "target_summary": "The 800th anniversary of Magna Carta regrettably failed to rehabilitate the widely maligned King John, instead solidifying his image as \"diabolical.\" This enduring condemnation largely stems from a popular, anachronistic understanding of Magna Carta as a foundational beacon of Western liberties. Celebrated by 17th-century English rebels and American revolutionaries alike, the charter's almost mystic, incantatory quality casts John, who ignored its initial terms, as an irredeemably malign figure.\n\nHowever, a closer look reveals a more nuanced reality. The Magna Carta of 1215 was not a constitutional document guaranteeing universal freedoms, but a deeply flawed peace treaty designed to halt an incipient civil war between John and a faction of rebellious barons. Its extreme terms, which effectively made the king a \"phantom monarch\" by empowering a baronial committee to police his actions, were inherently unacceptable to any medieval ruler. John's swift repudiation, therefore, was arguably a pragmatic act, perhaps even anticipated by the barons themselves, who might have sought to provoke his transgression as justification for further rebellion.\n\nFurthermore, the rebel barons, often romanticized as \"freedom fighters,\" are more accurately depicted as \"tight-knuckled, low-browed feudal reactionaries\" resisting John's increasingly effective administration. Contrary to chroniclers' portrayals, a wealth of evidence from pipe rolls and charters indicates John was a vigorous, constantly moving monarch, highly adept at mobilizing his kingdom's resources and imposing royal will. The very existence of a rebellion, far from signifying weakness, points to a strong government that inspired opposition. Indeed, only a minority of England's barons actively opposed him in 1215, with a comparable number remaining loyal.\n\nThe myth of \"Softsword\" also unravels under scrutiny. John's military caution, often mistaken for cowardice, was a conventional strategy for the era, shared even by his formidable adversary, Philip Augustus. Instead, John excelled in siege warfare, demonstrating remarkable energy, determination, and success across numerous campaigns, including the pivotal siege of Rochester Castle. His strategic ingenuity, exemplified by his plan to relieve Chateau-Gaillard, was lauded as a \"masterpiece.\" Even his ill-fated 1214 French invasion achieved its primary goal of dividing Capetian forces.\n\nSimilarly, accusations of lasciviousness and cruelty, presented as definitive character flaws, demand historical context. Many medieval kings took mistresses, making John's alleged \"rake\" status less exceptional. His marriage to Isabella of Angouleme at a young age, while unsettling to modern sensibilities, was commonplace for the period. Charges of cruelty, such as the killing of his nephew Arthur or the starvation of Matilda de Braose, are not definitively proven, but if true, arose from the brutal political realities of the time, often involving rebellion or the refusal of crucial hostages. Judged against the actions of revered figures like Richard I or Henry V, John's ruthlessness fit within the fierce expectations of medieval kingship.\n\nUltimately, while John's reign coincided with the rise of two of the Middle Ages' most accomplished leaders and the inherent instability of his inherited Angevin \"empire,\" he was not \"less than successful.\" His true achievement lies in his remarkable tenacity, holding together a dissolving realm for as long as he did—a testament to a complex monarch whose reputation remains unduly tarnished by the enduring legend of Magna Carta.",

        "content": "Ad The execution of Anne Boleyn On the morning of 19 May 1536, Henry VIII s second wife, Anne Boleyn, became the first English queen to be publicly executed. Charged with adultery, incest and conspiring the king s death, Anne was beheaded on a scaffold erected on Tower Green, within the walls of the Tower of London. Her death, says historian Suzannah Lipscomb,  is so familiar to us that it is hard to imagine how shocking it would have been . Anne and Henry had been married for little more than three years at the time of her death. For her, Henry had left his wife of nearly 24 years and the mother of his child (the future Mary I), and broken with the Catholic Church. By the spring of 1536, however, Henry s affection had waned and he was hotly pursuing Anne s lady-in-waiting, Jane Seymour. Along with five courtiers, including Anne s brother, George, Anne was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London in early May 1536. Mark Smeaton, William Brereton, Francis Weston and Henry Norris were tried and found guilty of adultery with the queen, and of conspiring the king s death, while Anne and her brother were found guilty of high treason. By 19 May, all six convicted had been executed. Reporting on Anne s execution in 1536, Eustace Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador to Henry s court, wrote:  No one ever shewed more courage or greater readiness to meet death than she did .

Constructed overnight on 12 13 August 1961 by the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the wall s official purpose was to stop western  fascists  from entering east Germany and undermining the building of a socialist state. In reality, however, it served to prevent mass defections from east to west. Berliners awoke on 13 August to find themselves cut off from family, friends, work and in some cases even their homes   it was now impossible to get from east to west. The makeshift wall was soon replaced by a 12ft-tall, 4ft-wide reinforced concrete barrier, heavily guarded and lined with booby traps. In total at least 171 people were killed trying to get over, under or around the Berlin Wall, which stood until 9 November 1989. To find out more, click here.

Of the 2,208 people aboard ship   the largest vessel in the world at the time   only 712 survived. It took just two-and-a-half hours for the huge vessel to sink, and amid freezing temperatures many people are likely to have died within minutes of entering the water.

The fire began in the early hours of Sunday 2 September 1666, at the house of Thomas Farynor (aka Farrinor), the king's baker, in Pudding Lane, near London Bridge. Helped by a strong easterly wind coupled with dry and dusty air, the fire raged for three days, by the end of which 100,000 people had been made homeless. Officially only a handful of people died in the fire but the true toll is likely to have been much higher.

Dressed in a bright orange spacesuit and a helmet inscribed with  CCCP  painted in red (which marked him as a Soviet citizen so that he would be recognised after parachuting to safety following ejection from the spacecraft), the 27-year-old Gagarin set off with the word  Poyekhali!

A horror that shocked the world, the Salem witch trials have spawned hundreds of films, books, scholarly articles and plays, including Arthur Miller s acclaimed 1953 work The Crucible. The executed men and women were convicted on the spurious evidence of a group of young village girls who claimed to have been bewitched. Paranoia, fed by ongoing family feuds and attacks by Native Americans, developed into a wave of hysteria that quickly spread throughout colonial Massachusetts. Another 150 men, women and children were accused in the spring of 1692, and were only spared the gallows by confessing. To find out more, click here.

It claimed the lives of more than nine million soldiers and an unknown number of civilians, and, says the Imperial War Museum,  forever altered the world s social and political landscape . Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914 after weeks of tension following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo on 28 June.

Panic gripped the city as police hunted for the killer and speculation was rife as to his   or her   identity. Was Jack a doctor, a Jew, a foreigner, a butcher? Was Jack in fact Jill? One theory even linked the murders to Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Victor. Yet despite interrogating dozens of suspects the police failed to convict anyone of the murders, and to this day the killer s identity remains a mystery.

The only unplundered tomb of a pharaoh yet found in the Valley of the Kings, the tomb was filled with artefacts including statues and artwork   so many, in fact, that it took 10 years to catalogue them. The 1922 discovery, says art critic Alastair Sooke, sparked a global frenzy for ancient Egypt.  A craze for Egyptian exoticism convulsed the West, infiltrating both high and low culture across the fields of music, fine art, fashion, film and furniture design.  Carter became a worldwide celebrity, touring America in 1924 to deliver lectures about his finds. This Witness episode explores Carter s detailed record of his discovery. To listen, click here.

Within the first three seconds, says expert Stephen Walker, thousands were incinerated as the temperature at the burst-point reached 60 million degrees centigrade   10,000 times hotter than the sun s surface. The attack was followed three days later by a second atomic bomb dropped on the city of Nagasaki, which killed at least 50,000 people, although according to some estimates as many as 74,000 died. Many of the survivors suffered symptoms of radiation sickness, which include vomiting, fever, fatigue, bleeding from the gums, thinning hair, diarrhoea and, in the worst cases, death.

Just two-and-a-half years earlier, in November 1658, Cromwell had been given a state funeral at Westminster. An officer in the Roundheads (parliamentary army) at the outbreak of the Civil War in the summer of 1642, Cromwell went on to become one of the conflict s key figures and played a leading role in Charles I s trial and subsequent beheading. Following the king s execution a republic was declared, known as the Commonwealth of England. How, then, did Cromwell's body come to be dug up and symbolically executed? Witness investigates....

From the public demise of queens to humanity’s audacious leap into space, these pivotal moments continue to fascinate.\n\nIn 1536, a shocking spectacle unfolded on Tower Green as **Anne Boleyn**, Henry VIII's audacious second wife, became the first English queen publicly beheaded. Accused of treason, adultery, and incest—charges still debated by historians—her fall marked a dramatic end to a reign for which a king had famously defied Rome.\n\nJust over a century later, London faced an inferno. The **Great Fire of 1666**, sparked in a baker’s house, swept through the city for three days, devouring over 65,000 homes, including St Paul’s Cathedral, and leaving 100,000 destitute. The English Civil War also yielded a bizarre epilogue in 1661, when the body of **Oliver Cromwell**, who orchestrated Charles I’s execution and established a republic, was exhumed and symbolically \"executed\" for treason, a grim posthumous repudiation of his powerful legacy.\n\nAcross the Atlantic in 1692, the small community of Salem, Massachusetts, descended into a terrifying hysteria with the infamous **witch trials**. Nineteen innocent men and women were executed, convicted on the flimsy testimony of young girls, as paranoia and fear spread like wildfire.\n\nThe early 20th century witnessed two momentous events: the **RMS Titanic** tragically sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 after striking an iceberg, claiming over 1,500 lives and plunging the world into stunned sorrow. Then, in 1914, the assassination of an archduke ignited the **First World War**, a global conflict that ultimately claimed millions of lives and forever reshaped the geopolitical landscape.\n\nAmidst Cold War rivalries, 1961 saw humanity achieve an extraordinary feat as Soviet cosmonaut **Yuri Gagarin** became the first human to journey into space, his 108-minute orbital flight transforming him into a worldwide icon. Yet, the same year brought a stark symbol of division: the **Berlin Wall**. Erected overnight, this concrete barrier brutally separated East and West Germany, becoming a deadly frontier where at least 171 souls perished attempting to cross before its eventual collapse in 1989.\n\nThe horrors of warfare reached an unprecedented zenith in 1945 with the **bombing of Hiroshima**. The world's first atomic bomb incinerated thousands in an instant, ultimately killing an estimated 135,000 people and unleashing the devastating specter of radiation sickness, forever altering the course of conflict.\n\nBeyond political upheaval and war, history also holds enduring mysteries and grand discoveries. In 1888, London was gripped by terror as **Jack the Ripper** mutilated five prostitutes in the East End, his identity remaining a chilling enigma despite intense investigation. Simultaneously, the early 20th century brought a beacon of ancient wonder: Howard Carter’s 1922 discovery of **Tutankhamun's** intact tomb. This treasure-filled resting place, the only unplundered pharaoh's tomb ever found, sparked a global \"Egyptomania\" and offered an unparalleled glimpse into ancient Egyptian royalty.",

        "title": "Henry VIII and the scourge of papal power",
        "content": "This article was first published in the August 2011 issue of BBC History Magazine Ad Henry VIII's most striking action and his lasting legacy was his break with Rome. In the 1530s he threw off papal jurisdiction, declared himself supreme head of the church on earth under Christ and denounced the usurpation of the pope and the superstitions of his church. Of course, in many ways the church in England was already monarchical, with bishops long nominated by the crown from the monarch s circle of counsellors and diplomats. But so boldly, persistently and vigorously to proclaim the royal supremacy was something new. Henry s daughter Mary reverted to papal obedience during her brief reign. Yet following Mary s death in 1558, her half-sister, Elizabeth, pursued Henry s policy of rejecting the authority of the papacy. Since then the Church of England has remained independent. And that has hugely affected English relations with, and attitudes to, the rulers and peoples of continental Europe. Nothing any other Tudor monarch did mattered as much. Henry did not just break with Rome. He saw himself as an Old Testament prophet king, called upon by God to purify the church. And in the 1530s the monasteries were dissolved and the practice of pilgrimage   journeys to the sites of shrines of saints   was brought to an end. Both measures had immense consequences. A society with men and women who, at least in principle, turn their face from the world and devote themselves exclusively to the worship of God is qualitatively different from one which has no monks and nuns. Immense consequences Henry was also much involved in the codification of what Christians should believe. Although he had broken from Rome, dissolved monasteries and effectively abolished pilgrimage, he rejected the Lutheran doctrine of justification-by-faith-alone and remained devoted to the mass. Henry also authorised the publication and the reading in church of the Bible in English translation, a measure which over time has had immense consequences. Henry s was thus a remarkably hybrid church. Probably very few agreed fully with the king; most would have preferred to remain Catholic while a minority wholeheartedly accepted the changes but wanted much more far-reaching reform. In many ways, Henry's influence proved decisive when it fell to Queen Elizabeth to determine the church of her realm. True, the liturgy would now be in English; but the ambiguities and ambivalences of liturgy and doctrine were not unlike those of the church of Henry's later years, just when Elizabeth was growing up. A Church of England that is, uniquely, no longer Catholic but not Protestant in any full sense, is very much Henry's legacy. Henry was also a warrior king. In 1513, 1523 and in the mid-1540s he launched invasions of France and continued to claim that he was rightfully king of France. Bold in ambition, cautious in practice, he was prepared to spend a fortune, not least the windfall of the dissolved monasteries  lands, on military campaigns which achieved little, both in France and in Scotland. And he left an appalling financial legacy to those who ruled the realm in the minority of his son, Edward. Henry was a passionate builder. Few monarchs have invested so much in grand palaces and hunting lodges. The hall of Hampton Court, which he largely rebuilt in the early 1530s, testifies to his ambitions. And his extraordinary collection did not merely leave its mark on contemporary architecture. The design of Nonsuch Palace, in which Henry was closely involved, had a huge influence on the great  prodigy houses  of Elizabethan England, and is reflected in the eclectic style of Wollaton, Hardwick and Kirby halls. Henry was also much interested in painting, and attracted to England Hans Holbein, one of the greatest artists of the age. Holbein s image of Henry VIII has had an immense impact: no English king is more recognisable. And then there are Henry s six wives, a real-life soap opera that writers of fiction would be hard-pressed to surpass. First, Catherine of Aragon, loyal to the end, but repudiated by Henry after he had fallen in love with Anne Boleyn; secondly, Anne, who three years after her marriage to Henry would be executed for treasonably committing adultery; thirdly, Jane Seymour, dying soon after giving birth to Edward; next, Anne of Cleves, a marriage arranged for diplomatic reasons but annulled as soon as foreign policy allowed since Henry found her physically repellent; then Catherine Howard, much too young, and also destroyed because she had committed adultery; and finally a more harmonious marriage to Katherine Parr. Too often, the popular image of Henry VIII has been of bluff king Hal, affable and pleasure-loving. Yet there was a darker side. Henry was exceptionally skilled in attracting the devoted service of remarkably capable counsellors   Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell. He was very astute at allowing his ministers to take public responsibility for unpopular policies   from taxation to the dissolution of the monasteries. In fact, no other Tudor ruler was as successful in leaving the impression that others were responsible   so much so that many have been deceived into thinking that he was a weak man manipulated by factions. Yet that he repeatedly destroyed his closest advisers, when in his eyes they had served their turn, argues that it was indeed Henry who brought them down. When facing opposition   or simply refusal openly to comply   no other Tudor ruler was quite so ruthless as Henry. Far from being a feeble monarch open to exploitation, he was an implacable king who, by the end of the 1530s, had turned into a tyrant.

Boldly proclaiming royal supremacy and denouncing papal authority, Henry declared himself head of the church in England. This pivotal move, though briefly challenged by Mary, was steadfastly upheld by his daughter Elizabeth, creating an independent Church of England that profoundly reshaped the nation's relations with continental Europe.\n\nHenry's vision extended to purifying the church, leading to the dissolution of monasteries and the cessation of pilgrimages, measures that fundamentally altered English society. He also crucially authorized the English Bible for church reading, an act with enduring cultural impact. Despite a personal theology that remained largely devoted to the Mass and rejected Lutheran doctrines, his \"remarkably hybrid church\" set an ambiguous precedent for Elizabeth's later religious settlement, forming a unique institution neither fully Catholic nor fully Protestant.\n\nBeyond his ecclesiastical reforms, Henry was a formidable, if often unsuccessful, warrior king. He relentlessly pursued costly military campaigns in France and Scotland, often funded by the wealth seized from the dissolved monasteries, ultimately leaving a severe financial burden. A passionate patron of architecture, Henry invested heavily in magnificent palaces like Hampton Court, and his innovative designs, particularly for Nonsuch Palace, greatly influenced later Elizabethan \"prodigy houses.\" He also drew renowned artist Hans Holbein to England, whose iconic portrait immortalized the king's imposing image.\n\nHis tumultuous personal life, marked by six marriages and their dramatic ends—from the repudiated Catherine of Aragon to the executed Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, and the short-lived Jane Seymour—proved a \"real-life soap opera\" of unprecedented public intrigue. Dispelling the popular image of a jovial \"bluff King Hal,\" the article reveals a darker, more ruthless monarch. Exceptionally skilled at attracting brilliant counsellors like Wolsey and Cromwell, Henry adeptly allowed them to bear the brunt of unpopular policies, only to ruthlessly destroy them once their purpose was served, ultimately evolving into an implacable tyrant by the late 1530s.",

        "title": "The secret intimacies of Edward IV: multiple marriages and a same-sex affair?",
        "content": "My research on the story of King Richard III began in the 1990s, and focused initially upon the allegation that he was a  usurper . That was a story which was later initiated by Henry VII, who seized Richard s throne, killed him, and then blackened his reputation. But the truth is that Richard was offered the throne by the three estates of the realm on the grounds that his elder brother, Edward IV, had committed bigamy, making Edward s children by Elizabeth Widville illegitimate. (Her maiden surname is commonly spelt  Woodville , but contemporary sources suggest that Widville or Wydville were more commonly employed in the 15th century. I therefore use  Widville .) Ad The story of Edward IV s bigamy intrigued me. As a result, my initial research focused upon the true story of Eleanor Talbot   the lady who was formally acknowledged in an act of parliament of 1484 as  married  to King Edward. Although some historians have questioned Eleanor s existence, I established clearly her identity, with the support of solid evidence. A picture emerged that supported the proposition that she had a relationship with King Edward IV. For example, the king appears to have given her land. Also he sent presents to her former father-in-law, Lord Sudeley, while Eleanor was alive   though following her death he changed tack and destroyed Lord Sudeley. It was also clear that the legality of Edward IV s subsequent marriage with Elizabeth Widville had always been questioned. The legality of Edward IV s subsequent marriage with Elizabeth Widville has always been questioned, says John Ashdown-Hill. (Photo by Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images) My research on the bigamy accusations led me to investigate all the other alleged stories about Edward IV and his private life. Once I d started, it rapidly emerged that, while most biographies of the king have traditionally claimed that he was born on 28 April 1442, most of them cite no source for that assertion. This is a problem, because some historians have used this birth date to back a claim that Edward himself was illegitimate. A political story, promoted by the French government and other opponents of Edward IV after he became king of England, hinted that his mother had a love affair with an archer. As a result, it was suggested that the archer, rather than Richard Duke of York, was Edward s biological father. Some modern historians have sought to back that claim by asserting that the Duke of York was not with his wife at the time of Edward s conception. But of course, that claim is based upon Edward IV s alleged birth date. When I sought out evidence for the date in question, I discovered that actually only one 15th-century source mentions 28 April 1442. Unfortunately, that source erroneously claims that the day in question was a Monday. What s more, another source offers a different date for Edward s birth. In short, I believe we can no longer claim to know for certain precisely when Edward was born. Who was Edward s real father? The allegations of illegitimacy have, of course, thrown Edward s relationship with his theoretical father, Richard Duke of York, into question. However, letters written by the Duke of York to King Charles VII of France   attempting (and failing) to set up a prestigious marriage for Edward with one of the daughters of the king of France   indicate that the duke considered Edward to be his son. That point is proved even more clearly by the wording that the duke used. In the surviving letters, he repeatedly refers to Edward as his son and heir. In his own writing, Edward naturally addressed the duke as his father. His letters suggest that a good relationship existed between them. Same-sex relationships When the Duke of York was killed in 1460, young Edward was still unmarried   and remained so when he became king of England. Shortly after his accession, however, Edward became involved with the beautiful Eleanor Talbot, and the most likely date for their secret marriage seems to have been Monday 8 June 1461, when the itinerary of Edward IV, as published in my latest book, reveals that Edward was in the vicinity of Eleanor s Warwickshire manor houses. Eleanor had produced no children by her first husband, Sir Thomas Boteler, and she doesn t seem to have become pregnant as a result of her relationship with the king. Edward IV therefore found himself confronted by a fruitless relationship. But about 18 months after his secret marriage with Eleanor, Edward encountered one of her first cousins, who may well have shared Eleanor s good looks, and who also, it seems, attracted the king. The cousin in question was Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. A wealth of clear contemporary evidence suggests that Edward loved Henry and that the two men slept together. This is by no means the only instance of an English king having a same-sex relationship. Earlier examples involved both Richard the Lionheart and King Edward II. Although Richard I s same-sex relationship worried his father, Henry II, the intimacy took place in France, and aroused no hostile response in England. Edward II wasn t so lucky. Likewise the relationship between Edward IV and the Duke of Somerset aroused opposition in some quarters. This led to an attack on the Duke of Somerset, which finally helped to break up his relationship with the king. Thomas More s version of history erased the name of Eleanor Talbot, says historian John Ashdown-Hill. (Photo by English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Another secret marriage? Later accounts   beginning with the version of  history  written by the Tudor grandee Sir Thomas More   suggest that, around this time, Edward IV took on a relationship with another young woman, Elizabeth Lucy. More even went as far as to claim that Edward IV was believed, in some quarters, to have secretly married Elizabeth Lucy. More offers a detailed story of how the young king s mother supposedly knew of this relationship. He also asserts that Richard III s subsequent claim to the throne was based upon the premise of Edward and Lucy s marriage. More goes on to say that the claim was false   making Richard III a usurper. While the offering of the English crown to Richard III was indeed based upon evidence that Edward IV had committed bigamy, the evidence clearly shows that the alleged first (and legal) wife of the young king was not called Elizabeth Lucy. She was, in fact, Lady Eleanor Talbot. Sadly, there s not a shred of contemporary evidence that a woman called Elizabeth Lucy ever existed   let alone that she had a relationship with Edward IV. The logical conclusion is that Thomas More s allegations were simply part of the attempt made by Henry VII and his successors to ensure that the name of Eleanor Talbot was written out of history. Henry VII had initiated this process in 1485, when he repealed unquoted the 1484 act of parliament that had acknowledged Eleanor as  married  to King Edward. On that occasion, Henry VII stated specifically that his aim was  that all thinges said and remembered in the said Bill and Acte thereof maie be for ever out of remembraunce and allso forgot . However, surviving letters written in 1533 and 1534 by Eustace Chapuys, the ambassador of Emperor Charles V at the court of Henry VIII, show that Henry VII hadn t succeeded in putting the story of Eleanor s marriage to Edward IV  out of remembraunce  on the European mainland. Therefore ongoing work was required for the sake of England s new reigning dynasty. Thomas More also asserted that the king had a love affair with a  Mistress Shore . But, as in the case of Elizabeth Lucy, not a single shred of contemporary evidence exists to show that Edward IV had anything to do with Mistress Shore. Unlike Elizabeth Lucy, however, Mistress Shore definitely did exist. Her maiden name was Elizabeth Lambert. A marriage for her was arranged by her family, and her first husband was called William Shore. Unfortunately, that marriage proved difficult, and the young wife appealed to the church for its annulment. Eventually she married again. Before that, however, she had two love affairs: one with Lord Hastings, and the other with Edward IV s step-son, the Marquis of Dorset. Curiously, a number of sources prove that her first husband, William Shore, was a supporter of Edward IV, and worked with him. However, no contemporary sources ever claim that Mistress Shore had a relationship with the king. Heaps of illegitimate children? The traditional story of Edward IV s private life asserts not only that he had mistresses, but also that he produced heaps of illegitimate children. However, that too proves to be untrue. The king is recorded as only acknowledging one illegitimate child during his reign. It was a boy, but his name is unknown. Previous historians tended to assume that the boy in question was Arthur Wayte/Plantagenet, later Lord Lisle. However, the evidence clearly shows that Arthur was only finally acknowledged as a royal  bastard  many years after the death of his alleged father. So he cannot have been the illegitimate child who was accorded formal recognition by Edward IV himself. Curiously, however, one or two girls also seem to have been recognised as illegitimate daughters of Edward IV years later, during the reign of Henry VII. One possible explanation for this is that Richard III was offered the throne on the assumption that Edward s children by Elizabeth Widville were illegitimate! John Ashdown-Hill states that Richard III, the youngest brother of Edward IV, was offered the throne by the three estates of the realm on the grounds that his elder brother, Edward IV, had committed bigamy. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The power behind the throne For all the question marks hanging over her marriage to the king, Elizabeth Widville seems to have exercised a great deal of influence over Edward IV. Despite later stories that he had many love affairs, from 1464 until his death in 1483, Edward seems to have been rather fond of his wife. Elizabeth Widville was acknowledged as Edward s legal wife during his reign, and her children were also officially recognised as the heirs to the throne. However, their status was always questioned in some quarters. Even members of the royal family   including the king s own middle brother, George, Duke of Clarence   disputed their claims. One result was that George was imprisoned and executed   apparently on the orders of Elizabeth Widville herself. A contemporary report written by Italian diplomat Domenico Mancini certainly suggests that this was the case. Elizabeth s later conduct confirms that she took a strong role in politics. Following Edward IV s death, with the aid of members of her own family, she attempted a coup to enable herself to act as regent for her young son. But in 15th-century England, regency powers were always assigned to the senior living prince of the blood royal   not to the mother. Thus when Edward IV died, according to English custom, power belonged in the hands of his surviving brother: Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who would, of course, go on to become King Richard III  The late John Ashdown-Hill was a historian and the author of The Private Life of Edward IV (Amberley Publishing, November 2016).

        "target_summary": "Embarking on a quest to re-evaluate the maligned reign of Richard III, historian John Ashdown-Hill meticulously unraveled the Tudor narrative, which painted Richard as a usurper. His inquiry into Henry VII's politically motivated campaign to blacken Richard's reputation led him to the pivotal claim that Richard was, in fact, legitimately offered the throne by the three estates of the realm. This offer stemmed from the crucial grounds that his elder brother, King Edward IV, had committed bigamy, rendering his children by Elizabeth Widville illegitimate. This revelation propelled Ashdown-Hill into a deep and captivating exploration of Edward IV’s complex private life, focusing initially on Eleanor Talbot.\n\nCentral to this historical re-evaluation, Ashdown-Hill meticulously researched Eleanor Talbot, the woman formally acknowledged in a 1484 act of parliament as \"married\" to King Edward IV. Despite some historians questioning her existence, his diligent research, supported by solid evidence, not only firmly established Eleanor's identity but also unveiled compelling details of her relationship with the King. Evidence such as land grants from Edward IV and presents sent to her former father-in-law strongly supported the proposition of a profound connection, leading to the most likely date for their secret marriage: Monday, June 8, 1461. This union, predating Edward’s subsequent marriage to Elizabeth Widville, was the foundation of the bigamy accusation.\n\nAshdown-Hill's investigative journey further dismantled other long-held historical misconceptions. He meticulously challenged the widely accepted but poorly sourced birthdate of Edward IV (April 28, 1442), finding it supported by only one erroneous 15th-century source. This deconstruction consequently undermined claims of Edward's own illegitimacy, which had been propagated by French opponents linking his mother to an archer. Ashdown-Hill’s findings affirmed the Duke of York's acceptance of Edward as his legitimate son and heir, evidenced by letters planning a prestigious marriage for Edward.\n\nIn a particularly startling discovery, his research brought to light compelling contemporary evidence of King Edward IV's passionate same-sex relationship with Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. This intimate connection, not unique among English monarchs as seen with Richard the Lionheart and Edward II, stirred opposition and ultimately contributed to the breakdown of their bond.\n\nFurthermore, the research meticulously debunked long-held Tudor-era fictions, such as Edward's alleged secret marriage to Elizabeth Lucy or affairs with 'Mistress Shore.' These narratives, propagated by figures like Sir Thomas More, were revealed as deliberate fabrications designed to erase Eleanor Talbot from history and legitimize the Tudor dynasty's claim by dismissing the bigamy charge. Henry VII himself initiated this process, repealing the 1484 act acknowledging Eleanor’s marriage. The notion of Edward siring \"heaps of illegitimate children\" was also corrected, with evidence pointing to only one acknowledged illegitimate child during his reign.\n\nFinally, the study illuminates the formidable political influence of Elizabeth Widville, Edward IV's official wife. Despite later romanticized stories, Edward appears to have been fond of her from 1464 until his death. Her strong role in politics was evident through controversial actions, including her suspected orchestration of the execution of George, Duke of Clarence, and her audacious attempt at a coup for regency after Edward’s death. This complex tapestry of personal relationships, political intrigue, and historical revisionism ultimately underscored the legitimacy of Richard III's accession. Following Edward IV's passing, customary law dictated that power resided with the senior living prince of the blood royal—Richard, Duke of Gloucester—especially given the deeply questioned legality of Edward IV's second marriage and the ambiguous status of his children by Elizabeth Widville, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of this tumultuous period in English history.",

        "title": "Elizabeth I s love life: was she really a  Virgin Queen ?",
        "content": "Over the years, countless books, novels, plays and films have depicted Elizabeth I s relationships with figures such as Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester; Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, and the Duke of Anjou. In the absence of conclusive proof one way or another, the question  did they or didn t they?  will always linger. Yet what is clear is that, both at home and abroad, rumours about Elizabeth s love life   real or imagined   circulated throughout her reign. Far from being the Virgin Queen, for some hostile observers Elizabeth was the  whore  of Europe. Ad Contemporary beliefs about the  insatiable  sexual appetites of women, together with Elizabeth s failure to marry, fuelled suspicions that the queen was engaged in secret sexual liaisons. Her Catholic opponents challenged her virtue, and accused her of a  filthy lust  that had  defiled her body and the country . The king of France joked that one of the great questions of the day was  whether Queen Elizabeth was a maid or no . The courts of Europe were abuzz with gossip as to the queen of England s behaviour. From the very earliest months of her reign, rumours spread of Elizabeth s relationship with Robert Dudley, her  sweet Robin  whom she had known since childhood. Within days of her accession, Elizabeth had appointed Dudley as master of the horse   a position that guaranteed almost daily contact. The Spanish ambassador reported to the king of Spain that  Lord Robert has come so much into favour that he does whatever he likes and it is even said that Her Majesty visits him in his chamber day and night . The pair s attraction to one another was widely commented upon, and their flirtatious behaviour shocked observers. When in 1560 Robert Dudley s wife, Amy Robsart, was found with her neck broken at the bottom of a staircase, speculation was rife as to the involvement of the queen and her favourite. In the years that followed, their close relationship continued, but any lingering possibility of a future marriage was cast aside. Elizabeth s councillors were determined to secure a favourable marriage for her, both as a means of consolidating England s position in Europe and to provide an heir to succeed her. While there was no lack of suitors, including Philip II of Spain; Erik XIV of Sweden and the Archdukes Ferdinand and Charles of Austria, no one managed to win the queen s favour or the unanimous support of her council. While foreign negotiations continued, Elizabeth enjoyed the attention of young male courtiers like Thomas Heneage, Christopher Hatton and Walter Raleigh, and later Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, all of whom flirted their way into the queen s favour. But Robert Dudley remained the queen s first, and probably only love. Perhaps as a reaction to Dudley s marriage to Lettice Devereux, dowager countess of Essex in the autumn of 1578, the following year Elizabeth welcomed Francois, the duke of Anjou, brother of the king of France, to the English court to present his suit for marriage. Robert Dudley, who Elizabeth called her  sweet Robin . (  Heritage Image Partnership Ltd / Alamy) It was not an ideal match. Anjou was a 20-something tiny and pockmarked Catholic who was widely rumoured to be a transvestite. Nonetheless, Elizabeth had always longed to be wooed in person by one of her illustrious suitors, and for a time she seemed to be genuine in her affections and interest in Anjou, whom she affectionately named her  frog . After a few weeks Anjou returned to France and negotiations appeared to falter in the face of public opposition to the match, but in October 1581 Anjou returned to England. Since his previous visit, he had continued to write love letters to the queen in which he expressed his desire to be  kissing and rekissing all that Your beautiful Majesty can think of , as well as to be  in bed between the sheets in your beautiful arms . Upon his arrival in London Elizabeth once again seemed enthralled and enraptured by Anjou s presence, and on 22 November, when the court was assembled at Whitehall to celebrate the Accession Day festivities, Elizabeth declared in public that she intended to marry him. She proceeded to kiss him on the mouth and give him her ring. Yet overnight, Elizabeth apparently had second thoughts and announced the next day she would not marry Anjou.

Watch all episodes now In this five-part series, historian Tracy Borman charts the changing fortunes of the monarchy, from the bloody Norman conquest of 1066 through the upheaval of civil war in the 17th century to the reign of Elizabeth II. It is doubtful whether Elizabeth had really intended to go ahead with the marriage given the popular hostility to it, but when Anjou finally departed she made much of being grief-stricken at the loss of her lover  with whom she so unwillingly parted . With the failure of the French match, hopes that Elizabeth would marry came to an end, but as she grew old and increasingly isolated she continued to seek the attention of her male courtiers. Robert Devereux, the young earl of Essex and stepson of Robert Dudley, was Elizabeth s last great flirtation. Despite the age gap between them, the nature of the relationship was again speculated upon. He soon became master of the horse and moved into his stepfather s apartments at court. One of Essex s servants boasted that  even at night my lord is at cards or one game or another with her, that he cometh not to his own lodging till the birds sing in the morning.  But this was a different kind of relationship than the one Elizabeth had had with Dudley, and was more about the desire of an ageing woman to be made to feel young and attractive by a handsome young courtier. Yet Elizabeth was never so swept away by her emotions that she lost a keen sense of political realities. In 1601, after what was seen to be an attempted coup against her, she ordered Essex s execution. In 1603 Elizabeth, then almost 70, died unmarried and celebrated as England s great  Virgin Queen . Yet her death served only to continue speculation about her private life. In the years that followed, the questioning of Elizabeth s virginity was no longer confined to hostile Catholic discourse, and there was a growing sense that Elizabeth s private feelings had compromised the integrity of her rule. In life, Elizabeth and the ladies of the bedchamber had tenaciously defended the chastity of her body to protect her reputation and defend her crown. In death, it is surely the possibility that she was not chaste that continues to fascinate, and ensure Elizabeth s enduring popularity and appeal.

        "target_summary": "Elizabeth I, a monarch whose reign was defined by strength and political acumen, was paradoxically also the subject of relentless, often scandalous, speculation regarding her private life. Despite her enduring epithet as the \"Virgin Queen,\" contemporary observers, both at home and abroad, persistently questioned her chastity. Far from a chaste icon, hostile critics branded her the \"whore of Europe,\" their suspicions fueled by her failure to marry and prevailing beliefs about women's inherent \"insatiable\" sexual appetites. Catholic opponents eagerly challenged her virtue, accusing her of \"filthy lust\" and asserting that she had \"defiled her body and the country.\" Even the King of France openly joked about whether she was truly a maid, while European courts buzzed with gossip about her intimate conduct.\n\nFrom the very dawn of her reign, whispers centered on her childhood companion, Robert Dudley, her \"sweet Robin.\" Within days of her accession, Elizabeth elevated Dudley to Master of the Horse, ensuring their near-constant proximity. The Spanish ambassador quickly noted Dudley's immense favor, reporting that \"Lord Robert has come so much into favour that he does whatever he likes and it is even said that Her Majesty visits him in his chamber day and night.\" Their mutual attraction was overtly apparent, their flirtatious interactions often shocking observers. The mysterious death of Dudley's wife, Amy Robsart, in 1560, with a broken neck at the base of a staircase, ignited widespread speculation, implicating both the Queen and her beloved favorite in the tragedy. While their passionate bond persisted, any real prospect of marriage faded, deemed politically impossible.\n\nThroughout her reign, Elizabeth's council ceaselessly pushed for a strategic marriage, not merely to consolidate England's European standing but crucially to secure an heir. A parade of illustrious suitors — from Philip II of Spain and Erik XIV of Sweden to the Archdukes Ferdinand and Charles of Austria — vied for her hand. Yet, none could secure both the Queen's genuine affection and the unanimous endorsement of her often-divided council. Amidst these protracted foreign negotiations, Elizabeth enjoyed the devoted attention of younger, charming male courtiers such as Thomas Heneage, Christopher Hatton, and Walter Raleigh, all skillfully flirting their way into her favor. But it was Robert Dudley who remained her first, and perhaps only, true love.\n\nIn a poignant turn, perhaps spurred by Dudley's marriage to Lettice Devereux in 1578, Elizabeth, the following year, entertained the suit of Francois, Duke of Anjou, brother of the King of France. This was an unlikely match: Anjou was a youthful, diminutive, pockmarked Catholic, widely rumored to be a transvestite. Nonetheless, Elizabeth, who had long yearned for personal wooing from a grand suitor, appeared genuinely captivated by her \"frog.\" After an initial visit, Anjou returned to France amidst faltering negotiations and public opposition. However, his return in 1581, preceded by ardent love letters expressing desires for \"kissing and rekissing\" and being \"in bed between the sheets in your beautiful arms,\" rekindled Elizabeth's enchantment. On Accession Day, November 22nd, before a gathered court at Whitehall, Elizabeth dramatically declared her intention to marry Anjou, sealing it with a kiss and the bestowal of her ring. Yet, with bewildering swiftness, she rescinded her declaration the very next day, asserting she would not marry him. While likely a calculated political gesture given the intense public hostility, Elizabeth later feigned profound grief at the departure of her \"lover,\" with whom she had \"so unwillingly parted.\"\n\nWith the French match definitively abandoned, the last vestiges of hope for Elizabeth's marriage dissolved. As she aged, growing more isolated, her inclination for the attention of male courtiers endured. Robert Devereux, the youthful Earl of Essex and Dudley's stepson, became Elizabeth's final significant flirtation. Despite their considerable age gap, the intimacy of their relationship was fiercely debated. Essex, like Dudley before him, became Master of the Horse, and his servant boasted of him being with the Queen \"till the birds sing in the morning.\" This dynamic, however, diverged from her early passion for Dudley; it appeared more an older woman's desire to feel youthful and attractive, courted by a handsome young man. Yet, Elizabeth's emotions never fully eclipsed her sharp political pragmatism. In 1601, following what was perceived as an attempted coup, she decisively ordered Essex's execution.\n\nIn 1603, at nearly 70, Elizabeth died unmarried, celebrated as England's legendary \"Virgin Queen.\" But even in death, the relentless speculation about her private life persisted. Beyond the hostile Catholic narratives, a growing sense emerged that her personal feelings might have subtly compromised the integrity of her rule. In life, Elizabeth and her closest ladies fiercely defended her chastity to safeguard her reputation and crown. In death, it is precisely the tantalizing possibility that she was *not* chaste that continues to captivate, ensuring her enduring popularity and magnetic appeal across centuries.",

        "title": "Ashurbanipal 'the Great', the Lion of Assyria",
        "content": "The name Ashurbanipal can hardly be counted among the most famous when it comes to ancient leaders. Against the likes of Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra and many others, he may struggle, in the Western world at least, to get picked out of a line up. Ad Even Gareth Brereton, the curator of a British Museum exhibition about him and his often-overlooked Assyrian Empire - I am Ashurbanipal: King of the World, King of Assyria, which ran from late 2018 until early 2019 - says that he is  the greatest king you ve never heard of . In his day, Ashurbanipal was the most powerful person on Earth. As the dominant force in seventh-century-BC Mesopotamia, the crucible of civilisations, he furthered Assyria s reach beyond what had been achieved in the previous two millennia. And he used his power to build a vast library of texts from across his empire   the oldest of its kind surviving   that has bestowed a wealth of knowledge about this ancient world and its peoples. In recent years, the legacy of the Assyrian Empire has been under threat by destruction at the hands of Islamic State. With priceless items and landmarks lost, it is more pressing than ever that Ashurbanipal does not become just another forgotten king. Who was Ashubanipal? For all he did as King of Assyria, the young Ashurbanipal did not expect to take the throne. His father, Esarhaddon, appointed him crown prince in 672 BC following the death of Ashurbanipal s eldest brother. This meant skipping over the older Shamash-shum-ukin, who instead took the lesser title of King of Babylon, a major city state (and former chief power in the region) under Assyrian control. Assyrian palaces were more than residences; they were complexes from which the empire was run (Photo by   Historical Picture Archive/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) Ashurbanipal, whose name means  The god Ashur is creator of an heir , received instruction in kingship, from royal decorum and hunting to administration and training for war. He learned to fight, fire a bow, ride a horse, lead a chariot, and mastered a skill associated for centuries with being an Assyrian warrior king: lion hunting. Slaughtering lions represented a king s ability to protect his people from the dangers of the world, so hunts would be public events.  I pierced the throats of raging lions, each with a single arrow,  Ashurbanipal had written, and in stone reliefs he is seen strangling them with his bare hands. Unusually, Ashurbanipal pursued scholarly pursuits too. He could read and write   in Sumerian, Akkadian and Aramaic   and studied mathematics and the esteemed practice of oil divination. He demonstrated such intelligence and aptitude for leadership that he would assume command of the court when his father travelled. It was on the way to Egypt that Esarhaddon died, leading to Ashurbanipal becoming king in 668 BC. The succession went smoothly, thanks to a treaty imposed on Assyrian subjects compelling their allegiance, and an oath of loyalty forced on the courtiers by his grandmother, Naqi a-Zakutu. He came to the throne with the empire at its height, and continued on the expansionist path of his predecessors. The world's greatest war machine Ashurbanipal brought a swift end to an ongoing war in Egypt by defeating both the Kushites and Nubians, capturing the capital of Memphis and sacking Thebes. Egypt remained under Assyrian control for around a decade, but even when the country achieved independence again, Ashurbanipal felt no need to retaliate. As trade continued, he lost nothing. That peace allowed him to besiege the Phoenician city of Tyre, then turn his attentions to the troublemaking regions of Elam and Urartu. War and quashing rebellions were near-constant features of Ashurbanipal s reign, and while he did not lead soldiers into battle himself, preferring to stay at the capital of Nineveh, his armies conquered all. The eighth-century-BC king Tiglath-Pileser III had reformed the Assyrian army into the world s greatest war machine and, under Ashurbanipal, its infantry, cavalry, chariots and siege expertise saw the empire grow to its largest, reaching from modern-day Turkey to the Persian Gulf. What defined the military campaigns of Ashurbanipal s reign was the utter ruthlessness of both his armies and the punishments he meted out as king. Defeated peoples would be plundered, taxed and deported to the empire, where they were be put to work or inducted into the infantry. Enemy leaders were made an example of. One relief portrays a king with a dog chain through his jaw and being made to live inside a kennel, and another shows the head of an Elamite king hanging from a tree while Ashurbanipal and his wife enjoy a meal.

He followed the policy of previous kings of splitting the empire into provinces or vassal states, each with a governor, and the empire had a reliable network for communication and supplies due to miles of royal roads, like arteries pumping the lifeblood of the empire. And at the heart: Nineveh. Now near Mosul in Iraq, it had been transformed into a city of never-before-seen size and splendour, complete with the so-called  palace without rival , built by Ashurbanipal s grandfather Sennacherib. Located on the bank of the Tigris River, Nineveh boasted spectacular gardens, a permanent oasis in the desert watered by canals and monumental aqueducts. No wonder that some historians today claim Nineveh, not Babylon, as the true home of the Hanging Gardens. It was here that Ashurbanipal ruled, built a new palace and established a centre of society and culture. War and quashing rebellions were near-constant features of Ashurbanipal s reign Some 300 miles to the south on the Euphrates River sat the city of Babylon, where Ashurbanipal s  favourite brother  Shamash-shum-ukin ruled as king. He kept the peace for. 16 years, but tensions between the two brothers borne from when their father overlooked him as heir slowly mounted. Ashurbanipal managed Babylonian affairs and dictated decrees, leaving his brother as nothing more than a puppet. Resentful at his restricted powers, Shamash-shum-ukin eventually formed a coalition with several conquered peoples and rebelled in 652 BC. The resulting war ended in disaster for Shamash-shum-ukin. His allies abandoned him and the Assyrians laid siege to Babylon for two years. Those inside starved   according to one inscription, resorting to eating the  flesh of their sons and daughters    and, with defeat approaching, Shamash-shum-ukin committed suicide by setting his palace ablaze. A remorseless Ashurbanipal set about on his punishment:  The rest of those living I destroyed  and their carved up bodies I fed to dogs, to pigs, to wolves, to eagles, to birds of the heavens, to fishes of the deep.  Ashurbanipal managed Babylonian affairs, leaving his brother as a puppet In the years that followed, Ashurbanipal s wrath fell hardest on Elam. With its people divided by civil war, he saw a chance to rid himself of this defiant enemy. His armies ravaged the lands, salted the ground to prevent anything from growing, plundered palaces and temples, looted royal tombs of their bones, and killed or deported in huge numbers.  | He tried to conquer knowledge itself   instead this ancient Mesopotamian king resorted to rule with terror So eager was Ashurbanipal to demonstrate his power that he claimed to have killed a king and his son with his own sword, despite not being at the battle. A more consistent display of his ruthlessness came after sacking the city of Susa in 639 BC, when he had four Elamite leaders draw his chariot in the triumphal procession. He left Elam in ruins, having refused any rebuilding or new governor, and with a severely decreased population. The Assyrian Empire had never been stronger, and at no other time did Ashurbanipal better deserve his self-given moniker,  great king, mighty king, king of the world . Through such names, writings and the reliefs adorning the walls of his palace, he established his image as warrior and conqueror, but also scholar. His ability to read and write made him a rarity among Assyrian kings, so he would be represented with a stylus, as well as a sword, in his belt. Assyrian soldiers escort loot and captives from Babylon in this marble relief. (Photo by Ashmolean Museum/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Texts would be signed with his name, implying he wrote them himself, and he once declared:  All the art of writing of every kind, I made myself master of them all   The best of the scribal art, such works as none of the kings who went before me had ever learnt, remedies from the top of the head to the toenails, non-canonical selections, clever teachings, whatever pertains to the medical mastery of Ninurta and Gala, I wrote on tablets, checked and collated, and deposited within my palace for perusing and reading.  The library of Ashurbanipal Hungry for knowledge, Ashurbanipal began an undertaking the legacy of which would surpass his decades of military victories and territorial expansion   the building of his library. Sometimes called the first modern library in history, it constituted the most complete collection of the world s knowledge at the time. A zealous man, Ashurbanipal hoped the texts would help him better understand the gods, so sought out omens, incantations, prayers, rituals and proverbs. Yet that only made up a fraction of the library. Thousands of texts, mostly written in cuneiform on clay tablets, had been gathered or copied by scholars sent to every corner of the empire. More came in after being looted or when Ashurbanipal threatened conquered nations to send what writings they possessed. Housed at his palace in Nineveh with rooms devoted to a myriad subjects, the tablets covered history, law, geography, medicine, sciences, lexicography, literature, poetry, religion and magic to name a few. Government records would be kept in deeper recesses. When discovered in the mid-19th century, the library revealed its most important treasures, such as a nearly complete list of Assyrian rulers and the Epic of Gilgamesh, regarded as the first great epic work of literature. This includes the famous Flood Tablet, which bears a striking resemblance to the biblical story of the Flood. The excavation also uncovered the Enuma Elish, the Babylonian creation myth. The Library of Ashurbanipal ranks as one of history s most significant archaeological finds. Excavating an empire Relying on religious texts and biased historians from Greece and Rome, understanding of the Assyrians remained scant or suspect until the 19th century. But when French archaeologist Paul- mile Botta discovered the city of Dur-Sharrukin in 1843, others were inspired to seek out the lost empire. English adventurer Austen Henry Layard excavated Nimrud and Nineveh, uncovering a wealth of artefacts, reliefs and colossal stone statues of lamassu. He is also credited with the unearthing of Ashurbanipal s library in 1852, although that was actually the achievement of his Assyrian assistant, Hormuzd Rassam. The finds, and translations of the ancient cuneiform texts by George Smith, caused a sensation. Excavations have continued, on and off, ever since. But when Islamic State held the land near Mosul, Iraq, many priceless treasures were bulldozed, blown up and vandalised. Their cleansing of anything un-Islamic is a reminder of the need to preserve our knowledge of the Assyrian Empire, or risk it being lost forever. Ashurbanipal s library long outlived his empire. In fact, the downfall of the latter helped the precious texts survive. Within two decades of his death c627 BC, the cause of which remains unknown, the Assyrian Empire had collapsed. It had grown too big, with its resources too stretched to remain stable, and the loss of its talismanic leader sparked both civil war and rebellions by a number of vassal states. In 612 BC, Nineveh was besieged and destroyed. When the attackers razed the once-wondrous capital, the burning walls of the palace fell on top of the library, unintentionally baking the clay tablets and preserving them for posterity. Today, the British Museum houses more than 30,000 tablets and fragments of the Library of Ashurbanipal, as well as the iconic 30-tonne stone lamassu (winged bulls with the bearded heads of humans) and the finest examples of reliefs from Assyrian palace walls. And while its exhibition may not make Ashurbanipal as famous as other ancient personalities, it brings together more than 200 artefacts to tell the story of an empire and its last great king, as well as the struggles archaeologists face with saving sites under threat. The Neo-Assyrian Empire Ashurbanipal was the last great king of one of history s first empires, its roots stretching back nearly 2,000 years before his time. In the 14th century BC, the millenniumold state of Assyria, once the powerhouse in Mesopotamia, broke the dominion of the neighbouring Mitanni kingdom and launched campaigns of conquest. Assyria flourished, for a while. It lost much of its territory in the 12th century BC   the cause remains a mystery   before a line of powerful kings restored their lands and influence, establishing what is called the Neo-Assyrian Empire. They subdued enemies, including Babylon and Egypt, due to innovations in battle. They were among the first to utilise iron, and deployed superior tactics. Soldiers fought in pairs   one to fire a bow while the other held a body-sized shield   and mastered siege warfare. What s more, they were utterly ruthless. The words  destroyed ,  devastated  and  burned with fire  appeared often in the inscriptions of kings. Yet they were efficient administrators too. They built far-reaching infrastructure, such as royal roads, and cities like Ashur, Nimrud and Nineveh. Although their power collapsed in the seventh century BC, the Assyrians helped draw the blueprint for every empire that followed.

        "target_summary": "Ashurbanipal, a name seldom invoked alongside other titans of antiquity like Alexander or Caesar, was nevertheless the formidable last great king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, reigning in the 7th century BC as arguably the most powerful individual on Earth. His era marked the zenith of Assyrian might, extending its vast influence across Mesopotamia, the very crucible of civilization, to an unprecedented degree.\n\nHis path to the throne was unexpected, appointed crown prince after his elder brother's demise. Ashurbanipal received an extensive education, meticulously trained in both the martial arts of a warrior king—mastering lion hunting, archery, and chariot warfare—and the sophisticated strategies of governance. Uniquely for an Assyrian monarch, he was also a prodigious scholar, fluent in multiple ancient languages and learned in mathematics and divination, showcasing a rare blend of intellect and martial prowess.\n\nAscending to power in 668 BC, Ashurbanipal commanded the world's greatest war machine, rapidly crushing rebellions and expanding the empire from modern-day Turkey to the Persian Gulf. Though he ruled from the opulent capital of Nineveh, his military campaigns were defined by their relentless efficiency and the utter ruthlessness of the punishments inflicted upon defeated enemies. Foes faced plunder, deportation, and often grisly public displays of their leaders' fates, cementing the king's fearsome authority. Nineveh itself, under his rule, became a city of unparalleled grandeur, boasting magnificent palaces and lush gardens fed by monumental aqueducts, a thriving administrative and cultural heart.\n\nYet, even this mighty king faced profound internal strife. His \"favorite brother,\" Shamash-shum-ukin, relegated to a mere puppet ruler in Babylon, eventually mounted a desperate rebellion. Ashurbanipal brutally suppressed the uprising, leading to a two-year siege of Babylon, his brother's fiery suicide, and Ashurbanipal's merciless retribution upon the starving city. His wrath also fell devastatingly upon Elam, which he utterly ravaged and left in ruins.\n\nBeyond his martial exploits and fearsome reputation, Ashurbanipal cultivated an image as both a warrior and a scholar. His profound literacy and passion for knowledge led him to embark on his most enduring legacy: the creation of the Library of Ashurbanipal. This unparalleled intellectual treasure trove, often hailed as the first modern library, systematically collected thousands of cuneiform tablets from across his vast empire, covering an astonishing array of subjects from history and law to medicine, literature, and magic. His intellectual hunger sought to gather all extant knowledge, demonstrating a scholarly ambition that rivaled his thirst for conquest.\n\nWhen discovered in the mid-19th century, this remarkable library at Nineveh yielded invaluable insights into the ancient world, including the nearly complete Epic of Gilgamesh and the Babylonian creation myth. These discoveries revolutionized our understanding of ancient Mesopotamia, which had previously relied on scant and often biased accounts.\n\nIronically, Ashurbanipal's mighty empire collapsed within two decades of his death around 627 BC, its resources overstretched and its leadership fractured. However, this very destruction played a vital role in preserving his greatest legacy; when Nineveh was sacked and burned in 612 BC, the intense heat from the falling palace walls inadvertently baked the clay tablets, safeguarding them for millennia.\n\nToday, as modern conflicts continue to threaten priceless Assyrian heritage, the enduring legacy of Ashurbanipal and his empire becomes even more critical. The British Museum, housing over 30,000 tablets from his library and magnificent Assyrian reliefs, continues to tell the story of this often-overlooked yet profoundly influential king and the civilization he led, ensuring that Ashurbanipal does not become a truly forgotten figure of history.",

        "content": "Analysis of the paintings inside the tomb suggests that two teams of artists carried out the work.The most skilled one worked on the left side of the tomb, and the other worked on the right. First, the rock walls were covered with plaster, and onto this outlines of the figures were traced with red paint and then corrected with black paint.Next came the artisans, who carved reliefs into the plaster following the painted outlines. Finally, the painters brought to life the walls and ceilings through the use of color. Over time, some layers of stucco that had been applied too thickly began to peel and fall off under their own weight. Remarkably, the damage was relatively minor and the paintings, now restored, provide a unique artistic insight into how the inhabitants of pharaonic Egypt understood death and the afterlife. (How a single battle and one young pharaoh turned Egypt into a superpower) Nefertari s journey to the afterlife The artistic conventions of the day are reflected in how the tomb was painted. Royal tombs were conceived as a microcosm, a world in themselves. The ceilings symbolized the sky, and the floor was the earth the deceased would become a part of. The burial chamber where the sarcophagus of the deceased king or queen was placed represented the kingdom of Osiris, the god of the underworld. It was believed Osiris presided over the tribunal that judged the soul, determining whether the person had been righteous enough to pass into immortality.

VANNINI/ALBUM If the judgment was favorable, the deceased began their ascent to rebirth with the sun god, Re. This transition involved a challenging journey during which the soul had to demonstrate certain knowledge and make offerings to the divine beings. The phases of this passage were detailed in the Book of the Dead. Nefertari s tomb was decorated and designed to help her on this journey, guiding the queen toward a full and happy life beyond death. The underground world of Osiris Nefertari s funeral ends with the transfer of her mummy to the burial chamber. This is symbolically the domain of Osiris, the god who embodies royal figures after death while simultaneously judging whether or not they are fit to enjoy immortality. Images of Osiris decorate the four pillars that support the room: On each pillar, he appears in human form and in symbolic form as the djed symbol. The mummy of Nefertari is put inside a large pink granite sarcophagus of which the lid, although broken, has been preserved.

        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK). This journey back in time starts in southern Alberta, two hours east of Calgary, where the ground cracks open to reveal a prehistoric archive dating back some 76 million years. Here, the rolling prairie collapses into wrinkled valleys carved out by ancient glaciers, banded in orange and grey layers like the pages of a medieval book and punctuated by bizarre  hoodoos    pillars of rock wearing jaunty sandstone hats. These are Canada s Badlands   so-called because early French fur traders found them inhospitable and difficult to cross. In this treeless desert, only the hardiest vegetation survives: yellow buffalo bean flowers and tiny pincushion cacti sprout between gullies, and the aroma of sagebrush hangs on the breeze. This area may have been bad for the settlers, but it s a goldmine for palaeontologists. The scientific motherlode lies in Dinosaur Provincial Park, a 29-square-mile UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the richest fossil locations on Earth. Visitors can explore a wealth of fossils while walking along the public trails of Dinosaur Provincial Park. Photograph by Bella Falk  These layers date to between 76 and 74 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous period,  reveals geologist Jessica Glombick, the park s visitor experience team leader.  People have been searching for fossils here since the early 1900s, though of course the local Indigenous people knew about them long before that.  Close to 50 dinosaur species have been found here, including Albertosaurus, a formidable predator related to Tyrannosaurus rex, and Corythosaurus, a crested herbivore whose near-complete skeleton was unearthed after a park ranger spotted a bone poking out of a cliff. These were found alongside fossils of prehistoric turtle shells and crocodile teeth, revealing a thriving, complex ecosystem. Visitors can explore public trails and museum displays, but to see these ancient monsters up close, it s best to join a guided hike into the park s protected zone, where fossils lie strewn like shattered pottery, and you may come across a hadrosaur leg bone or ankylosaur rib lying on the ground like driftwood washed up on a beach. Walking around requires concentration: there are so many fragments, it s almost impossible not to step on something. The best discoveries end up at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, two hours north in Drumheller. This small town of about 8,000 inhabitants is known as the  Dinosaur Capital of the World , a tag worn with pride. A gold dinosaur roars on the sign, there are dinosaur models on every street and the world s largest model dinosaur, an 86ft T-rex named Tyra, towers over the town centre. But these are mere warm-ups for the headline act. As one of the world s top dinosaur museums, the Royal Tyrrell houses more than 170,000 specimens covering almost the entire history of evolution, from weird, 500-million-year-old worms found in the Canadian Rockies to a woolly mammoth and sabre-toothed cat from the last Ice Age.

In the next display, still resting in the plaster jacket in which it was lifted out of the ground, is Borealopelta, the world s best-preserved armoured dinosaur, every scale on its bony armour and even its stomach contents set in stone. The showstopping finale is the Dinosaur Hall, where more than 30 mounted skeletons roar, fight or amble in frozen motion. A Tyrannosaurus rex looms over the room, its open jaws frozen mid-snarl. Nearby, the armour-plated herbivore Euoplocephalus, its back studded with bony knobs and its tail ending in a heavy club, squares up to the predator Gorgosaurus, while a long-necked Camptosaurus struggles for life in the jaws of an Allosaurus, their bones locked in an eternal battle to the death. But for anyone who wants to get even closer to prehistory, the active palaeontological coalface can be found near the city of Grande Prairie   a short flight from Calgary or a 4.5-hour drive from either Jasper or Edmonton. Here, the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum oversees one of the most exciting active fossil sites in the world: the Pipestone Creek bone bed. Nicknamed the  River of Death , this dense deposit contains the jumbled remains of a herd of Pachyrhinosaurus, powerful herbivores that looked a bit like modern-day rhinos, but with a huge frill on the back of their heads and a bony lump on their noses instead of a horn.  We believe there may have been as many as 10,000 individuals migrating through this area,  explains curator Dr Emily Bamforth.  But about 72 million years ago, they drowned in a catastrophic flood. Later, a second flood mixed up all the bones, creating a huge Pachyrhinosaurus puzzle.  The Pipestone Creek bone bed is nicknamed the  River of Death  due to the dense concentration of fossils. Photograph by Bella Falk The team now has the laborious task of separating the confusion of fossils from the solid rock, although the museum s Palaeontologist for a Day experience lets amateurs join the work. A rattling bus journey along an unsealed track, followed by a short walk through a forest of poplars and spruce, brings you to the bone bed, where a tarpaulin is peeled back to reveal a dark patch of rock, ridged and furrowed by shapes in the stone.  That s a rib,  points Emily.  That s part of the frill. That s a toe bone. We have about 100-200 fossils per square foot here and they re all interlocked. We may never know if this is one animal or 10.  Using an awl and rock hammer, guests help chip away at the surrounding matrix, careful not to damage anything precious. It s not a job for the impatient, but the potential payoff is priceless: the chance to help uncover real dinosaurs that have been buried for millions of years, or even to discover something brand new. And it does happen   last year, the team dug up one of the largest Pachyrhinosaurus skulls ever found. Nicknamed  Big Sam , he s now undergoing a thorough clean-up in the museum s lab, and guests can watch as technicians coax his broad snout from the stone after millions of years underground. What makes Alberta s dinosaur country so exceptional isn t just the quantity of fossils, but the fact that they re still being discovered. There s a real thrill in walking across the same landscape once trodden by dinosaurs, touching the remains of a 75-million-year-old monster or watching a rib emerge under a palaeontologist s tool. And all of it far away from the excitable school tour groups and theme park rides of most other dinosaur attractions.",
        "target_summary": "Journeying into southern Alberta, two hours east of Calgary, the earth itself seems to crack open, revealing the ancient heart of Canada's Badlands. Here, rolling prairies dramatically collapse into intricately wrinkled valleys, sculpted by millennia of glacial retreat. These striking landscapes are painted in bands of orange and grey, like the aged pages of a colossal geological tome, and punctuated by whimsical 'hoodoos'—pillars of rock crowned with jaunty sandstone hats. This treeless, arid terrain, once deemed 'inhospitable' by early French traders, now beckons with its hardy flora and the lingering scent of sagebrush on the breeze.\n\nWhat was once a challenge for settlers is now a profound treasure for palaeontologists. At its heart lies Dinosaur Provincial Park, a 29-square-mile UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned as one of Earth's richest fossil beds. Within these deeply layered rock formations, dating back 76 to 74 million years to the Late Cretaceous period, a vibrant prehistoric ecosystem thrived. Early 20th-century fossil hunters, building on Indigenous knowledge, uncovered nearly 50 dinosaur species, from the formidable Albertosaurus, a relative of T-rex, to the crested Corythosaurus, alongside ancient turtles and crocodiles. Visitors can wander public trails, but for an truly immersive encounter, guided hikes delve into protected zones where fossils lie scattered like shattered pottery, offering the chance to stumble upon a hadrosaur leg bone or ankylosaur rib, weathered like driftwood.\n\nJust two hours north, the town of Drumheller proudly proclaims itself the 'Dinosaur Capital of the World,' adorned with roaring golden statues and an imposing 86-foot T-rex, Tyra, towering over the centre. These serve as a mere prelude to the main attraction: the Royal Tyrrell Museum. Esteemed as one of the globe's premier dinosaur museums, it safeguards over 170,000 specimens, charting the vast sweep of evolution from 500-million-year-old worms to Ice Age behemoths. Its galleries showcase breakthrough discoveries, like the feathered Ornithomimus, providing the first evidence of North American dinosaur beaks and feathers. A showstopping exhibit features Borealopelta, the world's best-preserved armoured dinosaur, meticulously detailed with every scale and even stomach contents preserved in stone. The grand finale unfolds in the Dinosaur Hall, where over 30 mounted skeletons are frozen in dramatic motion—a snarling T-rex, an armoured Euoplocephalus squaring off with a Gorgosaurus, and a Camptosaurus locked in eternal struggle with an Allosaurus.\n\nFor those yearning to touch the very 'coalface' of active palaeontology, a journey near Grande Prairie leads to the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum and the astounding Pipestone Creek bone bed. Nicknamed the 'River of Death,' this site is a dense, jumbled deposit believed to contain the remains of up to 10,000 Pachyrhinosaurus, rhinoceros-like herbivores that met a catastrophic flood some 72 million years ago. The resulting 'Pachyrhinosaurus puzzle' presents a laborious task for palaeontologists, with an astonishing 100-200 fossils per square foot, all intricately interlocked. Amateurs can join this painstaking work through the 'Palaeontologist for a Day' experience, chipping away at the matrix, carefully uncovering fragments of prehistoric life. The potential reward is immense: the thrilling chance to help unearth genuine dinosaurs, or even make a brand new discovery, as seen with 'Big Sam,' one of the largest Pachyrhinosaurus skulls ever found, now being meticulously cleaned in the museum lab.\n\nUltimately, Alberta's dinosaur country stands apart not just for the sheer volume of its ancient treasures, but for the ongoing thrill of discovery. It offers a rare, authentic immersion into a prehistoric world, allowing visitors to walk landscapes once trodden by giants, touch 75-million-year-old remains, and witness new discoveries emerging—all far removed from the commercialized spectacle of typical dinosaur attractions.",

        "title": "The Amazing Dinosaur Found (Accidentally) by Miners in Canada",
        "content": "Nearly six years later, I m visiting the fossil prep lab at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in the windswept badlands of Alberta. The cavernous warehouse swells with the hum of ventilation and the buzz of technicians scraping rock from bone with needle-tipped tools resembling miniature jackhammers. But my focus rests on a 2,500-pound mass of stone in the corner. At first glance the reassembled gray blocks look like a nine-foot-long sculpture of a dinosaur. A bony mosaic of armor coats its neck and back, and gray circles outline individual scales. Its neck gracefully curves to the left, as if reaching toward some tasty plant. But this is no lifelike sculpture. It s an actual dinosaur, petrified from the snout to the hips. 0:34 The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes. Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal s skull. Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward. I can count the scales on its sole. Caleb Brown, a postdoctoral researcher at the museum, grins at my astonishment.  We don t just have a skeleton,  he tells me later.  We have a dinosaur as it would have been.  For paleontologists the dinosaur s amazing level of fossilization caused by its rapid undersea burial is as rare as winning the lottery. Usually just the bones and teeth are preserved, and only rarely do minerals replace soft tissues before they rot away. There s also no guarantee that a fossil will keep its true-to-life shape. Feathered dinosaurs found in China, for example, were squished flat, and North America s  mummified  duck-billed dinosaurs, among the most complete ever found, look withered and sun dried. During its burial at sea, the nodosaur settled onto its back, pressing the dinosaur s skeleton into the armor and embossing it with the outlines of some bones. One ripple in the armor traces the animal s right shoulder blade. Paleobiologist Jakob Vinther, an expert on animal coloration from the U.K. s University of Bristol, has studied some of the world s best fossils for signs of the pigment melanin. But after four days of working on this one delicately scraping off samples smaller than flecks of grated Parmesan even he is astounded. The dinosaur is so well preserved that it  might have been walking around a couple of weeks ago,  Vinther says.  I ve never seen anything like this.  A poster for the movie Night at the Museum hangs on the wall behind Vinther. On it a dinosaur skeleton emerges from the shadows, magically brought back to life. The remarkable fossil is a newfound species (and genus) of nodosaur, a type of ankylosaur often overshadowed by its cereal box famous cousins in the subgroup Ankylosauridae. Unlike ankylosaurs, nodosaurs had no shin-splitting tail clubs, but they too wielded thorny armor to deter predators. As it lumbered across the landscape between 110 million and 112 million years ago, almost midway through the Cretaceous period, the 18-foot-long, nearly 3,000-pound behemoth was the rhinoceros of its day, a grumpy herbivore that largely kept to itself. And if something did come calling perhaps the fearsome Acrocanthosaurus the nodosaur had just the trick: two 20-inch-long spikes jutting out of its shoulders like a misplaced pair of bull s horns.",

Its neck curves gracefully, adorned with individual scales etched into the gray stone. Astonishingly, fossilized remnants of skin still cling to the bumpy armor plates of its skull, and its right forefoot, splayed upward, reveals every scale on its sole. Such breathtaking fidelity, a result of rapid undersea burial, is considered \"as rare as winning the lottery\" by paleontologists, who usually contend with squashed, withered, or merely bone-and-tooth fossils.

        "content": "(How to dig up 55 tons of dinosaur bones in the world's fiercest desert) Up until now, the prehistoric timeline has been set by the rocks in which fossils are buried. When ancient volcanoes belched out molten rock and ash, for example, the outpourings of the eruptions contained radioactive minerals like uranium. Uranium turns to lead at a constant rate over time, what is sometimes referred to as its half-life, and for decades geologists have been able to look at the ratio of uranium to lead in a rock sample to calculate just how long ago that rock must have formed. Exposed dinosaur eggshell fragments at Teel Ulaan Chaltsai, Eastern Gobi Basin. A new dating method could help paleontologists more accurately understand prehistoric ecosystems and timelines. Lindsay Zanno The problem for paleontologists is that many fossils are found in sediments that lack these radioactive timekeepers. When an expert says a dinosaur is about 75 million years old, that usually means that their fossil was found in a rock layer in close association with a rock layer that contained something like an ash bed that could be dated correctly. Or that a fossil resembles another fossil found in such association with an ash layer. If a dinosaur fossil wasn t found in a rock layer full of ash or solidified volcanic rocks, paleontologists could only roughly estimate the fossil s age. The famous, well-preserved fossils of Mongolia s Gobi Basin dinosaurs such as the famous Velociraptor fall into this category, their true age uncertain without a direct way to tell geologic time.  There are important dinosaur sites in North America and Asia that preserve eggshells and bones but these haven t been accurately dated due to lack of ash layers,  says University of Calgary paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, who was not involved in the new study. Though she cautions that  dinosaur eggshells aren t found very often,  she notes that with uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating,  when they are [found], they could help us figure out the age of fossil sites, especially in places that don t have volcanic ash layers.  (Is this a teen T. Rex ... or a totally different dinosaur?)",
        "target_summary": "Establishing prehistoric timelines has long relied on the radioactive decay of minerals embedded in ancient volcanic rocks and ash. Geologists meticulously measure the uranium-to-lead ratio in these formations to determine their age with remarkable precision. However, this established methodology faces a profound challenge: a great many invaluable dinosaur fossils are unearthed from sedimentary layers that utterly lack these radioactive \"timekeepers.\"\n\nConsequently, the ages of countless iconic finds, such as the renowned Velociraptor fossils from Mongolia's Gobi Basin, remain broadly estimated, their true chronological placement uncertain. This predicament leaves numerous significant fossil sites across continents without accurate anchors in time. Yet, a promising new avenue is emerging: the uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating of dinosaur eggshell fragments. Although dinosaur eggshells are rare discoveries, experts believe that when found, this technique could offer a much-needed direct pathway to precisely dating fossil sites, particularly those devoid of volcanic ash, thereby enriching our grasp of ancient ecosystems and their vast timelines.",

She showed it to Raymond Dart, her professor at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who had encouraged his students to bring in any interesting fossil relics. (\"Lucy's Baby\" a Born Climber, Hinting Human Ancestors Lingered in Trees) Dart was interested in amassing a collection of fossils at the university. Having brushed up against anatomists working on fossil human ancestors while studying in London, Dart was particularly excited by this primate skull because it of where it was found. The presence of such a relative in South Africa meant, Dart thought, that a  tolerably complete story  of primate evolution could  yet be wrest from our rocks.  So he turned his attention to the location of the skull s discovery, a mine near the village of Taungs, South Africa. Wondering if any other interesting fossils might emerge, Dart asked the mine manager to collect further specimens. As luck would have it, within weeks, quarry workers stumbled upon another skull that then made its way into Dart s hands.

His mind is still on the Neanderthals  demise, which he chooses not to attribute primarily to a changing climate or demographic weakness. Homo sapiens caused Neanderthals to  vanish almost instantaneously from the annals of archaeology,  Slimak says. There s no need to deny our colonialist guilt, he says, or to seek solace in the strands of Neanderthal DNA that live on inside us. Even after half a million years on the planet, the Neanderthals  creativity and isolation didn t stand a chance against Homo sapiens  hyperefficiency and social networking. This was, he has said,  a fully fledged conquest.  Back in a rice field in northeastern Laos, Eric Suzzoni is leading Fabrice Demeter s team of scientists toward a new cave several miles north of their base camp. For the past two decades, the international team has worked on a single mountain, excavating a cluster of caves that has yielded a rare trifecta of ancient human species: In addition to discovering the Denisovan molar, the team has unearthed fossils of ancient Homo sapiens in one cave and, in another, a 130,000-year-old tooth most likely from Homo erectus.  That is an incredible result, but we re also looking at just one site,  says Laura Shackelford, an American paleoanthropologist with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a National Geographic Explorer who began working with the team in Laos in 2008. Denisovan remains  have to be all over the place, and we just haven t found them yet.  The future of the distant past seems to lie in Asia, a region that Demeter calls  a blank slate compared to Europe.  It started with the astonishing discovery of two diminutive  hobbit  populations Homo floresiensis in Indonesia in 2003 and Homo luzonensis in the Philippines in 2019. But the focus has now shifted to China. Ever since the Xiahe mandible was identified in 2019, Chinese paleoanthropologists have raced to reexamine the country s vast fossil collections dusting off their  cold cases to see if they too might contain Denisovan relics. Two archaic jawbones one dug up west of Beijing, the other dredged from the Taiwan Strait are close physical matches with the mandible. If their identity is confirmed, as expected, it will mean that Denisovans ranged over all of mainland Asia perhaps centering on what is now Chinese territory. 1:21 Chinese researchers have begun to reshape long-standing assumptions about when we branched off from our fellow hominins. A recent phylogenetic study of one Chinese skull pushed back our divergence from Neanderthals and Denisovans by 300,000 years, shaking long-held beliefs about whether our common ancestor even lived in Africa. Then there s the Harbin skull. Found in 1933 by a worker in northeastern China and hidden in a well for the rest of the 20th century, the 146,000-year-old fossil could belong to a hominin relative closer to modern humans than either Neanderthals or Denisovans a tantalizing clue that inches us nearer to the identity of our common ancestor. Some scientists think the Harbin skull could represent a branch of the Denisovan family or even a completely different lineage. Local paleoanthropologists gave the lineage a distinctly Chinese label: Homo longi, or Dragon Man. (The Harbin skull was the basis for the model constructed by paleoartist John Gurche.)",
        "target_summary": "In the tranquil setting of a French garden, researcher Slimak offers a provocative reinterpretation of the Neanderthals' demise, asserting that *Homo sapiens*' \"hyperefficiency\" and \"fully fledged conquest\" led to their near-instantaneous vanishing, rather than climate change or demographic weakness. He argues for acknowledging a 'colonialist guilt' in our ancient past, dismissing comfort in shared DNA.\n\nMeanwhile, the quest for humanity's deeper origins shifts dramatically to the vibrant landscapes of Asia. In Laos, an international team led by Eric Suzzoni and Fabrice Demeter, including Laura Shackelford, is unearthing a remarkable trove of ancient human species—*Homo sapiens*, *Homo erectus*, and the elusive Denisovans—within a single mountain's caves. This rich mosaic hints at a vast, undiscovered history, with Denisovan remains believed to be spread 'all over the place.'\n\nAsia, once a 'blank slate,' is now rewriting the narrative of human evolution. Following revelations of 'hobbit' species, the spotlight has intensified on China. The landmark Xiahe mandible discovery ignited a fervent re-examination of China's extensive fossil collections for more Denisovan relics, suggesting these ancient hominins roamed across mainland Asia. Chinese researchers are not only charting Denisovan ranges but also boldly challenging long-standing assumptions about the timeline of human divergence and the exclusively African origins of our common ancestor. The enigmatic 146,000-year-old Harbin skull, dubbed 'Dragon Man' (*Homo longi*), stands as a tantalizing clue, potentially representing a new, distinct lineage closer to modern humans than Neanderthals or Denisovans, offering a profound glimpse into the unknown branches of our distant family tree.",

In fairness, I must give credit for the dramatic find to a camel a large ungainly beast who had already won my affection with his deep brown eyes. I called him George. We had hoped to reach Kenya's frontier with Ethiopia by dusk, Dr. Meave Epps and I, in our exploration last August of this vast, virtually trackless region east of Lake Rudolf. It was the second season of our survey to learn the nature and extent of the area's fossil deposits. Had we been traveling in the relative comfort of a Land-Rover, no doubt we would have dismissed a small rocky outcrop some two miles east of our course as not worth investigating. But we were already three days' tiring march inland by camel from our base camp at Koobi Fora, on Lake Rudolf's eastern shore, where we had left the rest of the expedition. George was complaining noisily; he had carried me far enough that day. And frankly, I welcomed relief from his jolting gait. \"Let's have a look at that exposure and make camp,\" I said. \"Another day to the border won't matter.\" Meave, a zoologist on our expedition's staff, offered no objection, nor did the other two members of our camel party, Nzube Mutwiwa and Kamoya Kimeu. The grayish-brown ledge of sediments, sliced open by centuries of erosion, proved far more extensive than it had first appeared. As we approached it, Nzube and Kamoya circled out in one direction, Meave and I explored the other. Almost immediately we found fossils heavy, bleached bones of ancient elephants, pigs, and other animals of the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs, two to three million years old.",

This grayish-brown ledge, sculpted by centuries of erosion, proved a rich treasure trove. Almost immediately, the team unearthed a remarkable collection of heavy, bleached fossils – the ancient remains of elephants, pigs, and other creatures from the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs, dating back two to three million years.

        "content": "In fact, the woman who appeared next to Mumler was likely Hannah Frances Green, who worked nearby as a photographer and spirit medium, and would later become his wife. Mumler hadn t properly cleaned the photographic plate before using it again, leaving a remnant of Green s image behind. But Mumler a technological whiz and amateur chemist who had already racked up a variety of patents soon realized he could make a lot of money offering ghost photographs of the deceased for $10 a sitting (more than $300 today). It was a fertile time for photography and the paranormal to collide. The first-ever photograph had been taken around 1827, of a French rooftop. A decade later, the first humans were captured in pictures. The public was captivated by this new technology s ability to show realities few had ever seen, from distant countries to wildlife and nature. At the same time, scientific discoveries like the X-ray were proving that the human eye couldn t see everything. (Visit the most haunted sites in Charleston) This print is from one of the first radiographs made by the German physicist Wilhelm Konrad R ntgen (1845-1923), who discovered the electro-magnetic rays he named \"x-rays\" in W rzburg in November 1895. X-rays primed the public for believing in things that the naked eye could not see. Wilhelm Conrad R ntgen, Welcome Collection Meanwhile, in the late 1840s, three sisters had sparked a religious fervor in a small town in upstate New York. Claiming to communicate with ghosts via strange tapping noises coming from the walls of their farmhouse, the Fox sisters became a national obsession. The public had also recently been introduced to long-distance communication in the form of the telegraph. It wasn t that far-fetched, writes Peter Manseau in his book The Apparitionists, that mediums might stretch that communication into another plane entirely: the spirit world. Spiritualism, a religious movement connecting the realms of the living and the dead, was born. Over the next few years, scientific challenges to Spiritualism arose but then the Civil War plunged the nation into a state of fear, grief, and mourning. By the time Mumler was passing around his unique photograph, the country was already a year into the conflict. Photography had become a way for families to memorialize their loved ones. Mothers had portraits taken of their sons before they left for battle, and soldiers carried photos of their families to the frontlines. Back in Boston, Mumler began experimenting in the dark room with double exposures and other tricks to give the appearance of spirit visitors. Pensive children, concerned parents, and loving husbands surfaced, often appearing to embrace the living. The appetite for spirit photography was limitless in the bereaved nation.",
        "target_summary": "In an era where the boundary between the visible and invisible seemed newly permeable, William Mumler, an amateur chemist and technological innovator, inadvertently stumbled upon a phenomenon that would define his career. A photographic plate, imperfectly cleaned, left the faint, spectral trace of Hannah Frances Green, a woman who would later become his wife. Mumler, quick to recognize the profound emotional and financial potential, began offering \"ghost photographs\"—images purporting to capture deceased loved ones—for a considerable fee.\n\nHis enterprise flourished amidst a unique confluence of societal developments. Photography itself was a marvel, barely a few decades old, enchanting a public fascinated by its ability to reveal unseen worlds and distant realities. Simultaneously, scientific breakthroughs, notably Wilhelm Röntgen’s discovery of X-rays, had demonstrated that the human eye could not perceive all existence, priming minds for the unseen. Adding to this ferment, the Spiritualist movement, ignited by the Fox sisters’ claims of communicating with spirits and bolstered by the new telegraphic technology that blurred notions of distance, had captivated the nation.\n\nThe devastating Civil War then plunged America into a profound state of grief and yearning. With families desperate to memorialize and connect with their fallen, Mumler’s darkroom became a haven. Through artful manipulation of double exposures and other techniques, he crafted poignant images of spectral figures—pensive children, comforting parents, loving spouses—appearing to embrace the living. In a nation steeped in mourning, the appetite for such tangible spiritual connection proved limitless, cementing Mumler’s place as a purveyor of solace in a sorrowful age.",

        "content": "Part of Hood s division advanced through Devil s Den, below Little Round Top, ousting Sickles s men in what a Texan fighting there called  one of the wildest, fiercest struggles of the war.  Hood was seriously wounded early on, and Brig. Gen. Evander Law took charge, leaving no brigade commander to direct the crucial attack on Vincent s men guarding Little Round Top.  Hold this ground at all costs!  Vincent told Col. Joshua Chamberlain, whose 20th Maine Infantry occupied the very end of the Union line. After withstanding repeated assaults by the 15th Alabama Infantry, Chamberlain s men scattered their foes with a bayonet charge. Heavy fighting continued elsewhere until Brig. Gen. Stephen Weed came to the aid of the mortally wounded Vincent and secured Little Round Top for the Union at the cost of his own life. July 2, 1863: War in the Wheat Field The battle raged in the Wheat Field, where Sickles s beleaguered Third Corps buckled under pressure from brigades led by Col. George  Tige  Anderson of Hood s division and Brig. Gens. Paul Semmes and Joseph Kershaw of McLaws s division. To hold the line, Meade reinforced the Third Corps with men led by Brig. Gens. James Barnes and John Caldwell. Barnes went in first but found Kershaw on his flank and pulled his forces back, obstructing Brig. Gen. Samuel Zook of Caldwell s advancing division.  If you can t get out of the way,  Zook shouted,  lie down, and we will march over you!  Passing through, Zook s troops entered the Wheat Field alongside the Irish Brigade of Col. Patrick Kelly. Attack on Meade's left A map by Robert Knox Sneden depicts John Bell Hood s troops approaching Little Round Top while others fought across Plum Run and through Devil s Den, grappling with troops led by Hobart Ward, holding the left flank of Daniel Sickles s Third Corps. After the attack began, John Sedgwick s trailing Sixth Corps arrived from the south, buttressing Meade s left as fighting spread northward to the Wheat Field and Peach Orchard and as Federals on Culp s and Cemetery Hills came under attack by Ewell s corps. Virginia Historical Society A third brigade under Col. Edward Cross joined in a bloody assault that left Cross and Zook mortally wounded but drove the Rebels into Rose s Woods. Around 6:30 p.m., Brig. Gens. William Barksdale and William Wofford of McLaws s division delivered a staggering blow at the Peach Orchard. Pouring through the gap left by the collapse of Brig. Gen. Charles Graham s brigade, Wofford s troop of Georgians drove Federals back while Barksdale s Mississippians routed the remainder of Brig. Gen. Andrew Humphrey s division along Emmitsburg Road. The tide turned when Sickles fell wounded near the Trostle House, and Hancock of the Second Corps took command. He restored order by rallying retreating units on Cemetery Ridge and bolstering them with reinforcements. After sending a brigade led by Col. George Willard to repulse Barksdale, Hancock beat back a charge led by Brig. Gen. Cadmus Wilcox, and Lee s furious attack ended in a stalemate. (Reconstruction offered a glimpse of equality for Black Americans. Why did it fail?) July 3, 1863: Pickett's Charge After two days of fighting, Lee did not give up. He ruled out another attack on Meade s left, which had been heavily reinforced. Prospects for success looked little better on Meade s right, where Confederates in Ewell s division had advanced late on July 2, breaking through at Cemetery Hill before being repulsed there, as they were at Culp s Hill. Further attacks by Ewell stood to prevent Meade from shifting forces from his right to bolster his center, along Cemetery Ridge, where Lee hoped for a decisive breakthrough. That meant advancing across open ground into the teeth of Union defenses a perilous charge entrusted to George Pickett s fresh division of 6,000 Virginians, with Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew s division advancing to their north and others following. Confederate high-water mark Pickett s Charge reaches a climax as Federals beat back surging Confederates in a painting by Peter Frederick Rothermel, who drew on eyewitness accounts. State Museum of Pennsylvania Lee s plan went awry early on July 3, when Federals attacked Culp s Hill, triggering a battle that ended inconclusively before Pickett was ready to advance. Lee still had hope that a massive artillery bombardment would impair Meade s defenses on Cemetery Ridge. At 1 p.m., Rebel gunners opened fire. For all the sound and fury, little damage was done. Many Confederate gunners overshot their targets, while Federal artillerymen limited their counterfire to conserve ammunition. When the guns fell silent, Longstreet, who had argued against the attack, signaled reluctantly for the infantry to advance.  This is a desperate thing to attempt,  said Brig. Gen. Richard Garnett of Pickett s division.  It is,  replied Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead, whose brigade followed Garnett s.  But the issue is with the Almighty, and we must leave it in his hands.  To close up with Pettigrew s division to the north, Pickett s men had to march obliquely to their left, which exposed them to deadly flanking fire. Hardest hit were Brig. Gen. James Kemper s men, who went down in droves when Vermonters led by 8 Brig. Gen. George Stannard enveloped their right flank.  Great masses of men seemed to disappear in a moment,  wrote Col. Wheelock Veazey of the 16th Vermont Infantry. All along the line, Confederate ranks crumbled under the searing impact of artillery and infantry fire. Against all odds, Armistead led a few hundred followers over the stone wall at the Angle, where the Federal line jutted forward slightly, but they were soon overpowered in hand-to-hand fighting. As Lee s battered forces withdrew, hopes for the Confederate cause receded with them.",

        "content": "Politicians and diplomats are heading to Katowice, Poland, in December for the next round of international climate negotiations. This summer s heatwave   an  unambiguous  sign of global warming, according to a recent report   will be in their minds. A major cause of that warming is two centuries of rising consumption of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas). Large-scale coal consumption began during the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century. Oil boomed from the start of the 20th. Use of all fossil fuels then expanded dramatically during the Second World War and the economic boom that followed. This expansion was one of several impacts of economic activity on the natural world that earth systems scientists define collectively as the  great acceleration . This is seen as part of the Anthropocene, a new geological epoch in which the impacts of human activity work on the same scale as great natural forces. The identification in the 1980s of global warming, perhaps the most dangerous such impact, did nothing to slow fossil fuel consumption growth. Today, the quantity of greenhouse gases pumped out by fossil fuel use in three years is about the same as that produced in the whole of the 19th century. Who has been consuming all these fossil fuels? Rather than individual households, it is more accurate to think about technological systems   car-based transport and the urban infrastructure that supports it; electricity networks; industrial systems reliant on carbon-heavy materials such as steel; and agricultural methods that soak up gas-based fertilisers   and the social and economic systems in which they are embedded. Take electric air conditioning (AC) systems, used widely in hot summers. They first appeared in large numbers before the First World War, in the US, which had pioneered the installation of urban electricity networks from the 1880s and led the way in popularising appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and radios. In the 1920s, AC was marketed aggressively, as were electric lighting and motor cars. Manufacturers, anxious to sell to schools, battled furiously against New York state regulators, who argued that fresh air from open windows would be better for pupils  health than conditioned air. Sales of AC units, like other consumer electric goods, soared again in the US in the boom that followed the Second World War. The doubts of homeowners and office managers, many of whom regarded AC as a luxury, were overridden by the construction industry, who were convinced by AC manufacturers to install it as standard. AC made urban growth and industrial production possible in the tropical climate of the US southern states, as the historian Raymond Arsenault showed in his seminal article of 1984,  The End of the Long Hot Summer . In the 1960s, AC was a major cause of the reversal of the trend of out-migration from the South to other parts of the US. By the 1980s, AC, like other energy-guzzling household technologies, was already ubiquitous in US cities and common in other rich countries. Today, such technologies are condemned as wasteful of fossil fuels. An interpretive challenge in researching and discussing the global history of fossil fuel consumption is to explain how   even after the world s governments acknowledged, at the 1992 Rio summit, the need to stop global warming   their use continued to rise. It is a common fallacy that soaring fossil fuel use in the last quarter of a century is largely about first-world consumer technologies, such as AC, being diffused across developing countries. There are small, relatively rich, corners of the global south where these are used, but their contribution to total global fuel consumption is minor. And the fundamental inequalities remain. Canada s per-head energy consumption is estimated at 450 times higher than that of the poorest African countries. US households use four times as much electricity for air conditioning alone as Nigeria s use for everything. But this is not solely about first-world consumers. Final-user technologies develop and spread as part of larger systems. AC, for example, needs a reliable electricity supply, which is beyond the reach not only of 14 per cent of the world s population, who have no electricity, but of a further 25 per cent or so who have limited or erratic supply. Furthermore, AC and other electrical appliances have become a part of life in energy-intensive cities largely built with energy-intensive materials, such as cement and steel. These cities are characterised by badly insulated buildings and energy-wasteful transport systems: these two inefficiencies consume far more fossil fuels than AC systems. During the postwar boom, when fossil fuels were cheap, technologies that used them were scarcely regulated. The 1970s  oil price shocks made for temporary improvement; much of that progress was reversed in the 1980s; the threat of global warming has stimulated little action. From plastics to construction, aviation and car travel, governments allowed (indeed, encouraged) crucial decisions to be made according to companies  profit motives. Japan   where the energy efficiency of new AC systems rose by 68 per cent in the decade to 2005, because regulators required improvements   is the exception that proves the rule, at least in regard to AC. Weak regulation is part of a larger political problem: the ideological conviction that it is market mechanisms that can and must reduce fossil fuel consumption. This belief underpinned both the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which failed to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and the 2015 Paris agreement, with its voluntary   and inadequate   targets. Governments that failed to put money into moving away from fossil fuels nevertheless oversaw hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for those fuels. Technological systems have evolved the way they have because of the social and economic systems in which they are embedded. A move away from fossil fuels requires the wholesale transformation of all these systems. Simon Pirani is the author of Burning Up: A Global History of Fossil Fuel Consumption (Pluto Press, 2018).",

Falls of Clyde, built in 1878, had been moored as a museum ship in Honolulu since the 1960s but had fallen into a poor state of repair. The Honolulu Harbour Board confirmed it had the ship towed into deep water about 25 miles offshore on Wednesday and then scuttled. The news has been met with anger and dismay by campaigners who have spent more than a decade trying to bring the ship back to its birthplace to rebuild it. Falls of Clyde was the first in a series of nine iron-hulled ships, all named after Scottish waterfalls, built in the late 19th Century by the Port Glasgow shipbuilder Russell & Co. The ship spent many years carrying various cargoes to and from the Far East and Australasia before moving to Hawaii. Hawaii Department of Transportation Falls of Clyde was towed out of Honolulu Harbour at dawn and scuttled in deep water In the early 20th Century it had steel tanks fitted and was converted into a tanker to carry paraffin to the islands, where it later became a floating fuel depot before being acquired by a museum in Honolulu. But the ship was badly damaged by a hurricane in the 1980s, the maritime section of the museum closed down and for years it has been left slowly decaying. Enthusiasts in Scotland have spent a decade trying to bring the ship home for restoration, but were unable to reach an agreement with the harbour board which wants to redevelop the quay where it was moored. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said the operation to remove the ship began at dawn on Wednesday and it was sunk about 25 miles south of the harbour. It said the vessel's name, wheel and bell were retained along with other artefacts which will be put on display. 'A day that will go down in infamy' The destruction of the historic ship has been widely criticised by maritime heritage groups both in the UK and the USA. Friends of Falls of Clyde, a group of supporters in Hawaii, described it as \"a day that will go down in infamy\". \"It is almost inconceivable that this situation has been allowed to happen,\" the group posted on social media. The group organised a farewell ceremony with bagpipers on Tuesday after learning that the ship was to be sunk the following morning. The Tall Ship Glenlee, the charity that looks after another Clydebuilt sailing vessel moored beside Glasgow's Riverside Museum, said it was \"deeply saddened\". Falls of Clyde had been one of only six surviving large sailing vessels built on the Clyde, and only two remain in the UK - Glenlee and the Cutty Sark. David O'Neill, from the Scotland based Save Falls of Clyde campaign, said he was \"horrified\" at the behaviour of the authorities in Hawaii but had become resigned to the ship meeting such a fate after years of fruitless negotiation. He first became involved in efforts to rescue the ship in 2015 when someone in Hawaii alerted him to its condition, prompting him to post an appeal on social media saying: \"Old Scottish lady needs a lift home.\" A Norwegian firm which operates heavy lift ships offered to transport Falls of Clyde back to Scotland for free, but the campaign was soon embroiled in a wrangle with the harbour board over insurance costs and other conditions. A 19th Century oil painting of Falls of Clyde when it sailed in the Far East Earlier this year Mr O'Neill said an American firm won a contract to remove the ship from the harbour and it also offered to transport it to Scotland for free. \"They didn't want to sink the ship - they had a conscience and a respect for maritime heritage,\" he said. But the deal between the firm and the harbour board fell through, and the contract went instead to another company which then carried out the scuttling. The Hawaii Department of Transportation (DOT) director Ed Sniffen said it had made the \"difficult but necessary\" decision in a bid to protect the immediate and long-term security of Honolulu Harbour. \"The port is the state's economic lifeline as 85% of goods consumed in Hawaii must be imported and 91% of those goods reach our islands through this critical facility,\" he said. \"Since 2008, the Hawaii DOT afforded ample opportunity to the Friends of Falls of Clyde and other parties interested in restoring, preserving, and/or repatriating the vessel. \"A number of well-intentioned plans and efforts were not fruitful and did not address the risk the deteriorating vessel posed to the port.\" He said that before the ship was sunk the contractor removed materials that may degrade the marine environment, including pollutants and items that could create debris. He added that the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act permit also required consideration of land-based alternatives prior to authorisation of ocean disposal but no land-based disposal options were determined to be feasible.

        "content": "Skeletons found in mass grave are ancient Roman soldiers, study finds Scientists believe the skeletons, which were found completely intact, belong to men who lived 1,700 years ago Now, researchers from several European archaeological institutions have been able to determine not only when the men lived, but also how they may have died. Mursa was conquered by the Romans during the first century BC and became a large settlement that was also an important centre for trade and craft. The male skeletons, all with various injuries, were found \"completely preserved\" during excavations in 2011 at the site of the Roman city of Mursa - modern-day Osijek - in Croatia's far east, a new research paper says. Scientists say seven skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia were most likely Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago. According to the paper, the men in the grave were aged between 36-50 years old, taller-than-average in height, and were \"robust\" individuals. Their diets were mainly vegetarian, but some had also indulged in a little meat and seafood. All showed various healed and un-healed injuries, including those caused by blunt force trauma, and there were puncture wounds on two of their torsos, which the scientists believe were likely caused by arrows or spear tips. All of the men were suffering from some kind of \"pulmonary [affecting the lungs] disease during the final days of their lives\". DNA analysis has also revealed the men had a mix of ancestry and that none appeared to be from the local area. The paper noted that the Roman Empire was a particularly violent era and that Mursa was involved in several conflicts. The researchers believe the men were likely victims of the 'Crisis of the Third Century', most probably the battle of Mursa from 260 CE, when there were \"numerous battles fought between various claimants to the throne\". The paper states that the pit the skeletons were found in would have originally been a water-well - several of which have been discovered in the area. It notes that mass burials and mass graves were \"not a customary way of interring the dead in the Roman Empire\", and were mostly used in extreme situations and mass casualty events. Given the various angles the skeletons now lie, the researchers say they were \"most probably thrown in\" the well before being covered with soil. Mursa has been of archaeological importance for years, with various ancient civilisation sites discovered in the area.",

Producer Robert \"Bumps\" Blackwell said he didn't appreciate Richard until he saw him play at the city's famous Dew Drop Inn. He said: \"That was when I begin to know and understand Richard, because all you've got to do is give Richard an audience, turn the lights on, and the show is on.\" Richard's bandmate and friend Ron Jones recalled in the Arena documentary: \"He jumped on the piano and sang, 'Awop-bop-a loo bop alop-bam-boom!' So they heard it and said, 'Wait a minute, what's that?' It was a hook that they had never heard before, but Richard had been singing that phrase for years on the Chitlin' Circuit.\" Richard's influence spanned generations and genres But if Tutti Frutti was going to be a hit record, its risqu  lyrics needed a major rewrite. Deacon John, former band leader at the Dew Drop Inn, told Arena: \"The lyrics could be interpreted as gay sex. They're not going to play that on the radio!... And everybody knew, this ain't about ice cream! But the primary reaction from the producer's point of view was, 'Hey, this sounds like a hit record.'\" Producer \"Bumps\" Blackwell said: \"I asked him did he have a grudge against making money?

So we wrote the words,'Tutti frutti, oh rooty,' and a girl named Sue and a girl named Daisy, put Richard on the piano, and in 15 minutes I think we cut two or three cuts, and it's been history ever since.\" The recording may have been unbeatable, but in the US it wasn't the biggest hit version. The man who introduced the delights of Tutti Frutti to the mainstream was Pat Boone, a squeaky-clean square who specialised in taming rock'n'roll for a mostly white audience. If he had known about the original lyrics at the time, he probably would have been appalled. Boone told Arena: \"What I wanted to sing were songs about love and happiness and all that. That was what they played on the radio back then. Rhythm and blues music was called race music. Here I am, a church-going white kid from Nashville. I knew very little of it. But then when I heard a song by Little Richard called Tutti Frutti, I just flat-out loved it and so I thought, 'I'm going to do my version of it.'\" It sold one million records.

The Peebles Hoard, which had lain undisturbed for 3,000 years before it was discovered in 2020, was acquired by National Museums Scotland (NMS) last year. It comprises more than 500 unusual bronze and organic objects and components, many \"without archaeological parallel anywhere in the world\".

Dating from between 1,000 and 800BC, it was allocated to NMS under the Treasure Trove system, with a payment made to the detectorist Mariusz Stepien who found it. NMS said the defining technological characteristic of the Bronze Age was the widespread use and production of bronze - an alloy of copper and tin that is usually a deep golden colour. However, conservation of the Peebles Hoard has revealed rare silver-coloured objects from an era when silver was unknown. Crown Copyright Hundreds of pieces were discovered by a metal detectorist in 2020 Analysis has revealed the colour is the result of high levels of tin on the surface.

The 55-year-old beat off his nearest rival, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, to emerge as the clear winner after a historic second round of counting, which included second-preference votes. Outgoing president Ranil Wikremesinghe trailed in third. It's a remarkable turnaround for a man who won just 3% of the votes in the 2019 election. Dissanayake, who contested as candidate for the National People's Power (NPP) alliance, has drawn increasing support in recent years for his anti-corruption platform and pro-poor policies   particularly in the wake of the country s worst ever economic crisis, which is still having an impact on millions. He will now inherit governance of a nation that is struggling to emerge from the shadow of that crisis, and a populace that is desperate for change. So who is president-elect Anura Kumara Dissanayake? A former Marxist Dissanayake was born on 24 November, 1968 in Galewela, a Sinhala-majority and multi-religious town in central Sri Lanka. Raised as a member of the lower middle-class, he is state school educated, has a degree in physics, and first entered politics as a student around the time when the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement was signed in 1987: an event that would lead to one of Sri Lanka s bloodiest periods. From 1987 to 1989, the Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP) - a Marxist political party with which Dissanayake would later become closely associated - spearheaded an armed revolt against the Sri Lankan government. The insurrectionist campaign, spurred by discontent among the youth of the rural lower and middle classes, precipitated a conflict marked by raids, assassinations and attacks against both political opponents and civilians which claimed thousands of lives. Dissanayake, who was elected to the JVP s central committee in 1997 and became its leader in 2008, has since apologised for the group s violence during this so-called \"season of terror\". \"A lot of things happened during the armed conflict that should not have happened,\" he said in a 2014 interview with the BBC. \"We are still shocked, and shocked that things happened at our hands that should not have happened. We are always deeply saddened and shocked about that.\" The JVP, which currently has just three seats in parliament, is part of the NPP coalition that Dissanayake now heads. Getty Images Supporters listen to Anura Kumara Dissanayake during a campaign rally on 16 September, 2024 A 'different' leader While campaigning for the presidential election, Dissanayake addressed another violent moment in Sri Lanka s recent history: the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings. On 21 April 2019, a succession of deadly blasts tore through churches and international hotels across the capital Colombo, killing at least 290 people and injuring hundreds more in what quickly became the worst attack in Sri Lanka s history. Five years later, however, investigations into how the co-ordinated attacks happened, and the security failures that led to them, have failed to provide answers. Some have accused the former government, led by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, of obstructing investigations. In a recent interview with BBC Sinhala, Dissanayake promised he would hold an investigation into the matter if elected   suggesting that authorities had avoided doing so because they were afraid of revealing \"their own responsibility\". It s just one of many unfulfilled promises from Sri Lanka s political elite, he added. \"It s not just this investigation,\" he said. \"Politicians who promised to stop corruption have engaged in corruption; those who promised to create a debt-free Sri Lanka have only worsened the debt burden; people who promised to strengthen the law have broken it. \"This is exactly why the people of this country want different leadership. We are the ones who can provide it.\" A candidate for change Dissanayake was viewed as a strong contender in the lead-up to Saturday s election, positioning himself as the candidate for change against a backdrop of simmering nationwide discontent. Former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was driven out of Sri Lanka in 2022 by mass protests sparked by the economic meltdown. Years of under-taxation, weak exports and major policy errors, combined with the Covid-19 pandemic, dried up the country s foreign exchange reserves. Public debt reached more than $83bn and inflation soared to 70%. Getty Images Sri Lanka's 2022 economic crisis saw people queueing for basic necessities. Two years later, many are still struggling Rajapaksa and his government were blamed for the crisis. And though his successor, President Wickremesinghe, introduced economic reforms that brought down inflation and strengthened the Sri Lankan rupee, people continue to feel the pinch. On a deeper level, the 2022 economic crisis and the circumstances surrounding it   including systemic corruption and political impunity   created demand for a different kind of political leadership. Dissanayake has leveraged that demand to his advantage. He has cast himself as a potential disruptor to a status quo which critics say has long rewarded corruption and cronyism among the political elite. Dissanayake has repeatedly said he plans to dissolve parliament after coming to power, in order to have a clean slate and a fresh mandate for his policies   suggesting in a recent interview with BBC Sinhala that he would do this within days of being elected. \"There is no point continuing with a parliament that is not in line with what the people want,\" he said. An advocate for the poor Among Dissanayake s policy pledges are tough anti-corruption measures, bigger welfare schemes and a promise to slash taxes. Tax hikes and welfare cuts were imposed by the current government as part of austerity measures aimed at steering the country s economy back on track   but they also left many people unable to make ends meet. Dissanayake s promise to rein in those measures appears to have galvanised support among voters, in an election where analysts predicted economic concerns would be front of mind. \"The country's soaring inflation, skyrocketing cost-of-living and poverty have left the electorate desperate for solutions to stabilise prices and improve livelihoods,\" Soumya Bhowmick, an associate fellow at India-based think tank the Observer Research Foundation, told the BBC before the election. \"With the country seeking to emerge from its economic collapse, this election serves as a crucial moment for shaping Sri Lanka s recovery trajectory and restoring both domestic and international confidence in its governance.\" Getty Images Dissanayake's pledges to cut taxes and boost welfare proved popular with voters Some onlookers, including investors and market participants, expressed concern that Dissanayake s economic policies could have an impact on fiscal targets and disrupt Sri Lanka s road to recovery. The presidential candidate tempered his messaging during campaign speeches, however, insisting that he was committed to ensuring repayment of Sri Lanka s debt. He also noted that any changes would be imposed in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has provided a buttress for the country s still-embattled economy. Many analysts think the next president's main task is building a stable economy. Athulasiri Samarakoon, senior lecturer in political science and international studies at the Open University of Sri Lanka, told the BBC that \"the most serious challenge is how to restore this economy\", including managing public expenditure and increasing public revenue generation. \"Any future government will have to work with the International Monetary Fund,\" he noted.

Now the president has given a pardon. How can people trust the judicial system now? We are now worried about our security. \"In this country, we are now being treated like slaves. I have written to the president (Mr Rajapaksa) saying he's dragging us to hell,\" Ms Premachandra, also a former MP, said. Hirunika Premachandra said it was no longer possible to trust the judicial system While convicted murderers have been pardoned, activists point out that others, like human rights lawyer Hejaz Hizbullah, have been languishing in jail for months. The former director of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Sri Lanka police, Shani Abeysekara, also spent months in jail. Mr Abeysekara was detained for about 10 months facing accusations that include falsely implicating a fellow officer, who was convicted of murder. He also headed the investigation into Duminda Silva's crime that led to his sentencing in 2016 and other alleged rights abuses during the previous Rajapaksa regime. One of the well-known cases he was following was the disappearance of a political cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda, who left home never to return in early 2010. Mr Ekneligoda was a trenchant critic of the Rajapaksas. Mr Hizbullah has been in prison for more than a year under the PTA anti-terrorism law for alleged involvement in Islamic radicalisation. \"This is an absolute lie and we are determined to prove his innocence in court,\" one of his lawyers said. The European Parliament earlier this month passed a resolution expressing concerns over Sri Lanka's human rights violations. The resolution also urged the European Commission to suspend the duty free access to Sri Lankan goods (known as GSP Plus). The suspension of duty free access will hit hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Sri Lankan exports to the EU, particularly ready-to-wear clothes. This will be a huge setback as Sri Lanka is already facing a major economic challenge due to repeated coronavirus lock downs.",

        "title": "Faith in Chains: The Hijacking of Islam by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan",
        "content": "There is a malicious paradox that still haunts humanity s conscience: one that is concealed in religious jargon that reeks of violence and revenge, in the echo of war screams and the shadow of smoke rising from the wreckage of broken lives. There are those who call themselves fighters for Islam, but assault soldiers and civilians, claim innocence and carry deadly weapons as if they were proud and honorable trophies. Organizations like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in the tribal belt of Pakistan serve as an easy example of such a group of people who violate the religious principles they claim to support. The TTP is one of the longest-lasting instances of terrorism in Pakistan that misinterprets Islam to serve a political purpose. The TTP   a group that emerged from the tribal belt following the US takeover of Afghanistan   aimed to impose its own twisted interpretation of Sharia, which not only targeted state institutions but also innocent citizens, schools, polio workers and religious minorities   actions that directly conflict with Islamic teachings. The TTP does not have political grievances or seek regional independence like many other militant groups; instead, it explicitly uses violence as a religious obligation. This makes its misuse of Islamic principles particularly significant and relevant to consider within the context of faith-based radicalization. The TTP s extremist rhetoric employs religious language to justify violence, and it remains crucial to return to the true meaning of Islam to counter these distorted terrorist ideologies. Religion was never the reason The reason behind such extremist groups is rooted in political and psychological systems and stems greatly from being uninformed and depressed. Research into poverty, conflict and development in Pakistan has shown that poverty can lead to radicalization of beliefs. Such research demonstrates that financial and social problems, rather than religious beliefs, create a prime environment for joining an extremist group. When young people are deprived of hope, education and opportunities, they become impressionable and vulnerable. This creates space for terrorists to exploit. Instead of being guided by genuine religious teachings, these youths are fed anger and resentment, dressed up as devotion to God. Through such manipulation, acts of violence are sanctified in their eyes, legitimizing revenge and sacrifice as something sacred. An Iranian study on the resurgence of the TTP shows that this group, which continues to inspire radical extremists today, did so by abandoning all principles of kindness, fairness and moderation established in Islam. They became notorious for their rigidity, rejecting any differences and excluding Muslims from their community for the slightest reasons. The current TTP has persisted in these wrongdoings and only intensified them. Their cruelty is driven by fanaticism, which disregards the mercy at the core of Islam. Authentic Islamic teachings never condone such actions Religion, according to the Holy Qur an (the central religious text of Islam) and the teachings of the founder of Islam, Prophet Muhammad, has nothing to do with violence; it is never linked to fire and bullets. In fact, in Islam, spreading fitnah   discord and strife   is considered among the gravest of evils. In the Qur an s Surah Al-Ma idah, verse 5:32, it is said clearly:  Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land, it is as if he had slain mankind entirely.  If a life is taken, it is as if a whole universe is lost. Islam holds the sanctity of life in the highest regard. But these extremist groups change the meaning of holy words, isolate parts of scripture and mislead people to support their bloodthirsty actions. While pretending to believe, terrorists work to control the community by threatening them. Terrorism only reveals the low moral values of those who commit it. They claim to seek justice, yet in reality, they just cause more destruction and ruin. In Islam, justice is not pursued through violence and guns; instead, its advocates seek justice by using respectful procedures, kindness and honesty. Several Islamic sources (like the Sirah and Hadith collections) recount that when the Prophet Muhammad faced deep persecution in Mecca, through mockery, boycott and attempts on his life, he showed restraint and entrusted justice to God. After the Muslim victory in 630 CE, known as the Conquest of Makkah, he marked his triumph not with revenge but with a general amnesty, forgiving long-standing enemies. He spoke the famous words,  Go, for you are free.  If violence is justified in the name of religion, it becomes even more dangerous because the perpetrators believe their actions carry divine approval. The Qur an, however, repeatedly stresses that peace should be the foremost goal for Muslims. If there is conflict between groups of believers, Surah Al-Hujurat, verse 49:9, advises them to find a solution.  If two groups among the believers should fight, then make a settlement between them. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the command of Allah.  This verse does not promote rebellion or terrorism. It commands one to pursue peace and justice in accordance with moral and rightful conduct. Terrorism rejects human dignity No matter the claims made, terrorism is an inhumane act that betrays the religion it purports to uphold. Supposed martyrdom achieved through killing, taking pleasure in spilling blood or committing suicide attacks are not acts of true faith; they demonstrate a lack of courage. Revenge against innocent individuals holds no honor, and hatred brings only further suffering. True strength lies in self-control, in the capacity to forgive those who deserve retribution and in helping others rather than spreading terror. The actions of groups like the TTP contradict Islamic principles rather than represent them. Every bomb detonated and bullet fired distances people from the message of peace that Islam carries. Jihad, in its true Islamic context, symbolizes  struggle  in the path of Allah, embodying the efforts to lead a virtuous life and to do better, making jihad a holy act. But instead of using the actual spiritual context, TTP has radicalized jihad by sowing chaos, confusion and suffering. Efforts should extend beyond security measures to reclaim the true perception of Islam. Communities, and especially the young, must be guided toward the religion s authentic teachings, which emphasize life over death and faith over fear. They should learn that prayer, compassion, and peace are stronger than violence, even in the face of oppression. Organizations like TTP are fueled by secrecy, lack of knowledge, fear and division. The antidote is light. Light in our minds, light in how we treat others, and the knowledge that Islam is indeed a religion of peace. Choosing mercy over revenge requires real strength; resisting hatred is far more powerful than fire. Fire doesn t match the strength of faith.

The event began in the US in the 1920s, and has been recognised in the UK throughout October since 1987, as a way of sharing, celebrating and understanding the impact of black heritage and culture. \"It's very important to know where we are coming from and where we are going,\" said Glen Crooks, who runs Glen's Kitchen out of St Pauls Learning Centre in Bristol. \"Black history should be taught all the time, not just in a month,\" he added. A free exhibition focusing on 500 years of black music in Britain will take place between 13-31 October at the centre. Glens Kitchen Glen's Kitchen in Bristol was featured on the BBC's Remarkable Places to Eat series Mr Crooks moved to England in 1967 to be with his mother after being raised by his grandmother in Jamaica. He said while growing up he was not taught about campaigners such as Martin Luther King or Paul Bogle. \"We are coming from a long, long way from slavery. As black people we've been through a lot but we still come out strong,\" he said. Elsewhere in Bristol, a pop up exhibition called Bristol Bus Boycott X, which marks 60 years of the Race Relations Act 1965, will be on show at the Vestibules under City Hall until 17 October, before moving to Sparks Bristol, Wills Memorial Building and the M Shed. Other events in Bristol can be found here. Toyin Dawudu/Wayne Campbell Wayne Campbell has photographed more than 100 protests around the world In Somerset, the powerful images of London artist Wayne Campbell's Celebration of Demonstration are being displayed at the newly-opened Shoemakers Museum in Street. Mr Campbell said he became a visual activist after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis by police officer Derek Chauvin. The event five years ago led to nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. Mr Campbell said: \"I remember being angry and upset and asking what am I supposed to do?\" He has since photographed more than 100 protests around the world. Mr Campbell said he believed \"education is key\", commenting that in rural areas \"if there are people willing to learn and understand about sections of society they weren't aware of in the past, that's great\". The photographer will be in conversation on 14 October at the Shoemakers Museum. Meanwhile, the actor and author Paterson Joseph will be at Westlands in Yeovil on 24 October speaking about his book Ten Children Who Changed The World, as part of Yeovil Literary Festival. Here are some more Black History Month events taking place in Somerset. Florence Nyasamo Florence Nyasamo said often there is too much focus on the past during Black History Month Florence Nyasamo, the founder of Lives of Colour in Cheltenham, said the month was important for celebrating the local community. Lives of Colour works with businesses, local authorities and schools advising on diversity initiatives and inclusion training. In 2024's Black History Month, the organisation launched a year-long programme of educational events, including students debating race equity and inclusivity in council decision-making. \"The focus is always in the past, Martin Luther King, Mandela, but what about the spaces we live in?,\" said Ms Nyasamo. \"What contributions are communities making? Because this is what will make this visible and why this conversation is important.\" Having moved to the UK 30 years ago from Kenya, Ms Nyasamo said the proudest moment of her life was when she helped arrange for Gloucestershire County Council to fly the pan African flag outside its office. Also during Black History Month, a new adaptation of William Shakespeare's Richard II will be performed in a Southern African Township theatre style at Swindon Arts Centre on 25 October. The play features an original score of Zimbabwean music and song. Elsewhere in Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire, libraries are promoting literature by black authors during October.

        "title": "'Paintings were suddenly seen as money': The reason art heists exploded in the 1970s",
        "content": "Acclaimed new film The Mastermind, starring Josh O'Connor, tells the story of an art robbery gone wrong. It's inspired by a wave of similar thefts during a decade known for upheaval. In May 1972, two men walked into the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts and hurried out carrying four paintings by Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso and a supposed Rembrandt (now believed to be the work of one of his students), holding a group of visiting high school students at gunpoint and shooting a security guard in the process. With the stolen artworks' worth tallying up to $2m ( 1.5m), the New York Times ranked it among \"the largest art robberies in modern times\". Some say it even inspired a far more famous crime nearby: the 1990 heist at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, in which $500m ( 370m) of art was looted, making it the costliest theft in US history full stop, with the crime remaining unsolved. The Worcester heist was orchestrated by career criminal Florian \"Al\" Monday, but the game was up after the two thieves he hired for the raid boasted about their exploits in their local bar. Within a month, the paintings were safely retrieved from a pig farm in Rhode Island and returned to the gallery. \"Ironically, Monday   before he was an art thief   had a band, and I have the 45 of his record,\" writer-director Kelly Reichardt tells the BBC. Her new film The Mastermind, which is released in the US this weekend, is loosely inspired by the chain of events that followed the Worcester robbery, as well as the wave of art heists that followed over the course of that decade. Mubi New film The Mastermind centres on middle-class art school drop-out turned robber JB (played by Josh O'Connor) (Credit: Mubi) Praised by The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw for locating \"the unglamour in the heist\", Reichardt's thoughtful art crime caper dismantles the usual rules of the glitzy, sensationalised heist movie. Blockbusters have long popularised the idea that there is something classy about this category of crime, particularly when it involves art: think, for example, of the 1999 version of The Thomas Crown Affair, in which Pierce Brosnan plays a very suave billionaire orchestrating a raid on New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.",

        "content": "Sixty years ago, anthology series Out of the Unknown premiered on the BBC. It served up serious, one-off sci-fi dramas exploring our relationship with technology, among other things. In a crowded TV landscape, few shows have carved out as distinct a niche as Black Mirror, Netflix's anthology sci-fi series comprised of individual, standalone dramas, all dealing with the dark side of modernity and technological progress. But while it may be strikingly different from anything else out there now, it's certainly not unique within TV history. In fact, you can see its roots all the way back in a classic British sci-fi show celebrating its 60th anniversary this month. Airing on the BBC between 1965 and 1971, and re-released on DVD in 2014 by the British Film Institute, Out of the Unknown was a cultural outlier. While there were various sci-fi shows on British and US TV at the time, they mostly offered escapism, such as Doctor Who (1963-89) and Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's various serials like Stingray (1964-65) and Thunderbirds (1965). Out of the Unknown's aim was more elevated: it set out to tell sci-fi tales that explored serious, adult subjects such as war, politics and technology, and mixed original scripts with adaptations of stories by celebrated authors like John Wyndham, Ray Bradbury and JG Ballard. Like the best sci-fi, it also managed to depict imagined futures while really commenting on the fears and tensions facing the world at the time of its production. BFI/ BBC One of the show's most remarkable episodes, an adaptation of EM Forster's The Machine Stops, foresaw the internet age (Credit: BFI/ BBC) In this respect and others, the parallels with Black Mirror are clear although there is an irony to this comparison. \"I have to confess I haven't seen it!\" Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker tells the BBC. \"The inspiration for Black Mirror really came from Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone, and lots of slightly odd BBC single dramas like [Nigel Kneale's] The Stone Tape and The Year of the Sex Olympics. I'm definitely riffing on work directly connected to [Out of the Unknown], yet I haven't seen it. It's interesting!\"",

        "content": "Rome has many great spectacles below street leve and the latest are the underground chambers and passageways at the Colosseum, due to open to the public from late August 2010. Rome s Colosseum (Piazza del Colosseo) just got even more interesting. The great 80,000-capacity stadium, where the masses used to bay for blood at free spectacles involving gladiators, wild beasts and those unlucky enough to get on the wrong side of the Empire, is due to open its underground passageways to the public from late August 2010. This part of the building was where the afternoon's entertainment used to cower pre-performance. It will be accessible through the back entrance once used by gladiators, with a new glass lift sinking down into the bowels of the building. The architect in charge of the project, Barbara Nazzaro, says that visitors will be able to see where the lions, tigers, bulls, ostriches and gazelles were kept in cells before being hoisted up on 80 rope-slung lifts to the ground floor. This process was a remarkable theatrical device, as the wild beasts used to appear as if out of nowhere onto the stage. Gladiators and scenery were also hoisted up in the same way. The elephants, however, were too heavy to be lifted up, so used to make their grand entrance through the main gates. This is a building that has until now been rather more impressive from the outside, but the opening of the underground sections means that visitors will be able to envisage the entertainments held here from a new, if chilling perspective. The other new section of the building that will be opening shortly is the highest part of the remaining seating, allowing spectacular views across the stadium. Rendering visits even more spookily evocative, the Colosseum is open till midnight on Saturdays from 21 August to the 23 October 2010. Rome has numerous other places where it is possible to explore underground, and perhaps nowhere sums up this multi-layered city more perfectly than St Clemente (Via di San Giovanni in Laterano). This is a 12th-Century church, lined with a shimmering apse mosaic. But it is discovering the staircase down to the next layer of history that makes this Rome's most extraordinary church. The steep staircase down leads to a 4th-Century church, decorated with fading frescoes. Yet something even more mystical and mysterious lies beneath: the next staircase down leads to a Roman house and pagan temple, complete with altar showing Mithras killing a bull. And echoing through the ancient temple is the sound of a river flowing even beneath this layer, running through a Republic-era drain. Rome's other great underground adventure lies out near the Appia Antica, to the southeast of town. Here are the catacombs, where Christians used to bury their dead, in a kind of warren-like after-dead ghetto outside the city walls. The most famous are the Catacombs of San Callisto (Via Appia Antico 110 & 126), the first official cemetery after the Roman Catholic church was founded at the end of the 2nd Century. This spider's web of narrow tunnels, complete with coffin-sized cavities, opens out into dark subterranean churches - a most evocative way to end an underground tour of Rome.

Day 2: Suzdal Drive 35km north to the enchanting village of Suzdal. The winding Kamenka River, flower-drenched meadows and dome-spotted skyline make this medieval capital a perfect fairytale setting. Peeking over the Kremlin walls are the star-spangled domes of the village's oldest church, the Nativity of the Virgin Cathedral (AD1220-onwards). A walk along the earthen ramparts reveals a veritable medieval wonderland with magnificent views of three monasteries, two convents and some thirty smaller churches. Afterwards, you can dine at the Kremlin refectory (trapeznaya), which has been serving delicious food for centuries. Day 3: Kostroma Get up early for the 173km drive to the northernmost point on the Golden Ring. Kostroma was founded in 1152, but the historic centre dates to the 18th Century, when the old wooden structures were demolished by fire. Spend the afternoon exploring the 14th Century Monastery of St Ipaty, which poses on the right bank of the Kostroma River. Exhibits are dedicated to the young boyar Mikhail Romanov, who was in exile here when he was elected tsar, thus launching the dynasty. Spend the night at the aptly named Hotel Volga, a Soviet-era establishment offering timeless river views. Day 4: Yaroslavl About 76km west, this is the namesake of Kyivan prince Yaroslav the Wise, who founded the town in 1010. His statue overlooks the town square, opposite the formidable 12th Century Monastery of the Transfiguration of the Saviour. Stroll along the banks of the Volga River and discover the myriad merchant churches, most of which date to the city's 17th Century heyday as a trading centre. Take a break to recover at an outdoor cafe along the quaint cobblestone pedestrian street ulitsa Kirova. Day 5: Rostov-Veliky Drive about 60km south along the road headed back to Moscow. Founded in 862, Rostov \"the Great\" gives the impression of a sleepy village, spread out along the shore of the Lake Nero. From the dusty streets rise the white-washed walls and shiny domes of the Kremlin, a relic of the 12th Century, when Rostov was the seat of the Grand Prince. Climb up into the fortress walls, from where you can also enter the unusual gate-churches. Keep your ears pealed for a bell concert, which the resident monks play from the belfry of the Assumption Cathedral.",

        "content": "The iconic skyscraper has the highest and best views in the city, its history is revelatory and makeovers to the lobby and observatories deserve a fresh look. It is so obvious, so clich  and so visible that visiting the Empire State Building gets, ironically, overlooked. Like the single slice meal, blue Yankee cap and yellow cab, the skyscraper is in the city s DNA, so familiar you feel as if you have been there even if you have never stepped foot on the observation deck. Or maybe you have written it off as an over-priced tourist trap, which is not entirely off-base. But as the gray monolith turns 80 years old on May 1, it is worth giving it a second   or first   try. The Empire State Building inspires the imagination, its views are the highest and best in the city, its history revelatory, and makeovers to the lobby and observatories deserve a fresh look. All you need to do is avoid the headaches and traps of a visit so that nothing detracts from the marvel. Avoiding the lines There are four famously-lengthy lines (tickets, security, elevator up, elevator down) but there are just as many ways to avoid them. You can visit during more predictably crowd-free times, particularly between the 8 am opening and the pre-lunch rush, and after midnight until the 2 am close. For other times, call ahead. I scored a lineless visit on a Wednesday just before sunset by calling 212-736-3100 and asking for the wait time. If the estimate exceeds your patience you can purchase an Express Ticket for $24 extra and get the velvet rope treatment at the front of each line. Or, for only a $2 online fee, you can at least buy and print out the normal ticket in advance and avoid the ticket line, which is often the longest. With those hurdles leapt you are free to enjoy the gleaming lobby, nearly half a block of prime Art Deco design. The illuminated celestial-meets-industrial scene of gold and aluminium leaf spheres and lines, modern by 1930s standards, had been obscured for decades by florescent lights that were modern by '60s standards. Its recreated glory, accomplished by historical architects and artisans, is classic Gotham. It left me feeling woefully underdressed without a fedora and pinstripe suit. The bar The Empire Room, an old-school-styled cocktail lounge of mohair, velvet, ebony and embossed leather that opened last year, extends that retro feel. The vibe is reminiscent of the early '60s-set television show Mad Men, though the soundtrack alternated between appropriate Harry Connick Jr tunes and mood-shattering Sade and Queen remixes. The cocktail menu includes classics such as the Ramon Gin Fizz, Waldorf and Martinique Daisy, all elaborately and proficiently executed. The bar's signature drink is a sweet, bubbly variation on the Empire State Cocktail -- gin, vermouth, Royal Combier Liqueur, lemon juice and raspberry-orange marmalade crowned tableside in a chilled martini glass with Moet & Chandon champagne. As an aside to the bartender shaking mine out, one pearl-necklaced hostess characterized the concoction as \"stupid\". And while it is an admittedly convoluted, fruity concoction Don Draper would not be caught dead sipping, the champagne was a nice addition to the classic recipe. It gave me a fizzy rush that aped the ascent of the building's dizzying height.",

        "content": "Ancient Vijayanagara, a crumbling 16th-century metropolis, is a stark contrast to the decadence of Goa s beach life. Once the hippie paradise of the sixties, Goa s beautiful beaches are now overrun with endless hawkers and techno music. Last year, the Indian state broke its own tourism record. But just beyond the tourist trappings of the tightly packed beachfront development, lie the ruins of the opulent former southern capital of the spice trade. Ancient Vijayanagara, now known as the village of Hampi, is just a day's drive from the Goan chill-out scene. It is a stark contrast to the decadence of beach life. The rice fields and coconut plantations drop away into vast expanses of arid farmland, worked by men dressed in dhoties, driving oxen in their bare feet. Granite boulders litter the landscape, in hues of gold, pink and grey, a rocky backdrop to the sprawling ruins. The entire city was ransacked in the 16th Century, leaving behind one of the most important cultural and religious monuments in the region. This crumbling metropolis was once one of the most beautiful cities in its time. Today it is one of the most impressive ruins. This is why you go to India. Where to start? Most people stay in the area known as Hampi Bazaar, which is situated beside the main temple (Virupaksha), or they venture out to the neighbouring town of Hospet. The scale of Vijayanagara is not to be underestimated (26 square km of ruins), especially in the midday heat, so it is advisable to rent a bike, motorbike or hire a rickshaw driver as you cruise from temple to temple -- although it is possible to walk. The perfect two-day exploration The best way to quickly grasp the magnitude of Hampi is to hike Mantanga hill, preferably at sunrise for the best views. Stone steps are carved into the hillside and while it is the only way to experience the full gestalt of the city, it is still hard to imagine how invading Muslims could have spent six months attacking and pillaging the once thriving capital of 500,000 people. The comparison between what must have been and what exists today is a constant part of the experience in Hampi. From there, head to the main river that cuts through the town, the Tungabhadra, to watch pilgrims and locals bathe down by the ghats. Every morning at around eight, the loveliest thing happens. The temple elephant, Lakshmi, carefully lumbers down the long stairs to the river and blesses the pilgrims with a spray of water before receiving her morning bath. It takes about an hour to scrub her down and she lays on her side, poking her trunk up out of the water and adjusting her ears to allow her handlers better access.",

        "content": "Archaeologists recently found the \"longest monument in Southeast Asia\". Get there before the crowds find it too. In the remote countryside of central Vietnam, archaeologists discovered the \"longest monument in Southeast Asia\", a wall that winds through pristine, rain-forested mountains and hill tribe villages, yet still unspoiled by the imminent arrival of busloads of tourists. Find of the century Earlier this year, Vietnam's most important archaeological discovery in a century was announced by Dr Andrew Hardy, head of the Hanoi branch of  cole fran aise d'Extr me-Orient (French School of Asian Studies) and Dr Nguyen Tien Dong, from the Institute of Archaeology (Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences). The rampart stretches 127.4 km from northern Quang Ngai Province, south into the province of Binh Dinh, and is the greatest engineering feat of the Nguyen Dynasty. The Long Wall of Quang Ngai, as it is now known, is made of alternating sections of stone and earth, is believed to have been built in 1819 as a cooperative effort between the Vietnamese and H're ethnic minority. Much like Hadrian's Wall in the United Kingdom, Quang Ngai's wall was also built along an ancient, pre-existing road, and not only provided security but also regulated trade along the route. Most of the wall is still in relatively good condition, attaining heights up 4 metres. Quang Ngai today Until now, Quang Ngai was seldom visited by tourists, apart from stops at the Son My Memorial Museum, site of the infamous wartime My Lai Massacre. The province remained politically sensitive as a result of those tragic events, and as such, travel by outsiders through the countryside was somewhat restricted. Since the initial discovery of the wall in 2005, Quang Ngai has slowly opened up. Several independent travellers have now ventured to see the wall since its existence was announced earlier this year. Quang Ngai City, the provincial capital, is a suitable base from which visitors can reach the wall. Apart from the city's only four-star hotel, Central Hotel, near the river, the city lacks anything approaching luxury accommodation. Dining is mostly street food and local specialties like ram bap (corn spring rolls), ron (tiny river clam soup) and ca bong song tra (Song Tra River mudskipper fish). As no major tour companies have offices in Quang Ngai yet, transportation consists of Mai Linh taxis (one of the few legal and reliable companies) and motorbikes for hire.",

Travel back more than 700 years ago to Acre, and sample the delights of a cosmopolitan crusader outpost before it falls to the Mamluks, and get tips on visiting the present day Israeli city. When to go The Mamluk sultan of Egypt and Syria, Baybars Bunduqdari, has agreed a truce with the Christian forces in Outremer. Act now and take advantage of our incredible peacetime offers. The Christians may have lost Jerusalem back in 1244, but Acre has become the crusaders' hip and happening capital. Acre boasts a safe harbour and markets galore, and it's a veritable melting pot of races and religions. You never know who you might meet around the next corner: assassin or merchant, Knight Templar or slave trader. The truce has been agreed for ten years and ten months, but who knows what will happen when it ends, so don't delay - book today! What to take with you A decent pair of shoes are essential if you take the overland route across Christendom, then down through Anatolia and Cilicia - though frankly that's so First Crusade. Besides, all the cities worth looting, such as Constantinople, have already been pillaged by your forefathers, so we highly recommend a sea crossing in this day and age. It's peacetime so you shouldn't need a weapon, but you might find a broadsword comforting if you can afford one - the threat of internecine war is never far away in this multicultural port. Costs and money Another good reason to book now is that your stay will be more economically viable in peacetime. Trade is thriving, with the Italian maritime republics selling arms and timber for siege engines to the Mamluks in Egypt - and the markets are overflowing with produce, meaning a lower risk of profiteering. Don't forget: during the siege of Acre by the crusaders at the end of the 12th century the price of a sack of grain rose to 100 gold pieces and many besiegers had to live on horse entrails and bark. This might be fine if you're French, but since our delicate British stomachs can't even cope with raw fruit, you'd be strongly advised to give this siege cuisine a wide berth. See Take a stroll down the vaulted streets and covered marketplaces in the Pisan and Venetian quarters and marvel at the wares: indigo from Iraq, glass from Egypt, perfume from Syria, or sugar from Acre's own factory. Smell the aromas of a thousand spices, eye the poisons on display, hear the many languages being shouted by traders. If shopping isn't your thing then head outside the walls and wander through the gardens and orchards, or take a day trip to the Springs of the Oxen, where Adam is said to have found the beasts with which to plough the earth. Why not do as the Arabs do and take a picnic?",

        "content": "As I watch him go, with his red nylon cape flapping out behind him, he looks more John Cleese than Julius Caesar, and it strikes me that many of our associations with ancient Rome are comic. But walk the path for any distance, and as the wall unfolds in front of you, it reveals a past that was also epic, poignant and strange. I d begun my walk the day before, heading east from Lanercost in Cumbria. It s my plan to walk the 40-mile stretch to Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland over four days. I set off early in the morning as a man called Maurice brings out the honesty box from his shed to set beside his bag of home-grown apples. Munching on one of Maurice s apples as I walk past the first standing remnant of the wall at Hare Hill, I find it hard to reconcile the peaceful atmosphere around me with what I know of the region s history. Ripe sloes and crab apples line the path that runs along green pasture where sheep and cattle graze happily in the soft rain. Hadrian ordered the construction of his wall in 122 AD;  to separate the Romans from the barbarians , his biographer wrote. It stretched in its heyday from coast to coast, with a pair of turrets and a  castle  or small fort every mile, and deep earthworks on either side. Larger forts, some of which predated the wall, garrisoned the troops and housed their dependants. Until antiquarians began to realise the significance of Hadrian s Wall and fought to preserve it in the 19th century, it was pillaged by locals for building material. Along its length, farmhouses that have been built out of Roman masonry still sit next to denuded sections of the wall. All the same, according to Richard Hingley, a Durham archaeologist who s writing a biography of the wall, locals never entirely forgot its importance. It helped define the border between England and Scotland. And as early as the 16th century, local landowners were collecting stones from the wall to display in their gardens. Nowadays, much of the wall is gone; sections of it are no more than dots and dashes of stonework. At the eastern edge of the route, slabs of wall turn up incongruously in Tyneside housing estates. Every now and again, you come upon a stretch that is sufficiently intact to give you a sense of what it must have been like during the centuries when it was Rome s northern frontier. Ruts cut by hundreds of years of wagon wheels can be seen in the stone gateways of forts. Here and there are stones carved by the soldiers to commemorate the completion of their work:  the cohort of Primus Pilus built this  scratched into a stone, or a phallus etched into a limestone block to propitiate a forgotten god.",

There is an old story about Lenin, set in the gilded splendour of a caf  somewhere in Central Europe, sometime in the early 20th Century. A pair of distinguished old gentlemen are discussing affairs of state over steaming cups of coffee and slices of cake.  There s talk of revolution,  says one, moustache quivering.  Any day now, they say.  \"Revolution!\" scoffs the second, cocking his thumb at the next table, where a scrawny young man with a goatee beard and flat cap is scribbling furiously in a notebook. \"And who's going to lead it - him???\" The tale is almost certainly apocryphal. But sitting in Prague's art deco Caf  Imperial, scooping the whipped cream off a v de sk  k va (Viennese coffee), it is an evocative fantasy. The future Soviet leader did visit Prague, in 1912. In fact, it was at the Prague Party Conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, held just around the corner in Hybernsk  street, that his Bolshevik faction broke away from the Mensheviks for good, with untold consequences for humanity. Unfortunately the Imperial was not built until 1914, so there goes the Lenin theory. But with its creamy tiles and Moorish mosaics, it is still a great place to sit and watch the world - and the trams - go by, though the prices are no longer revolutionary. Like many Prague coffee houses, the Caf  Imperial has undergone something of a makeover in recent years. Gone is the dark and dismal interior, the indifferent service, and - a terrible shame this - the legendary doughnut bowl, whose stale contents could once be bought and pelted at fellow patrons for exactly 1,942 Czech crowns (just over 100 dollars), a homage to an incident in the classic 1942 novel Saturnin, a sort of Czech Jeeves and Wooster. The Imperial is one of a handful of the great pre-war caf s - temples to caffeine, creativity and conversation - left in Prague. You wll find two of the most famous on the city's N rodn  street. The first, Caf  Louvre, boasts a beautifully-preserved interactive map in the marbled lobby, displaying the unfeasibly long list of caf s (160!) that served the Czech capital before war, Communism and Starbucks intervened. Each is marked with a little bulb that lights up when you press a button. Most, sadly, are long gone.

Poor boys can do very well in the running or boxing, mind you   and can then cash in on their success later on. But remember that all that victors at Olympia win is a symbolic prize of a crown of wild olive.

The celebrated stone circle standing proud on Salisbury Plain with its trademark lintel-topped sarsens has been an enduring source of fascination for millennia. The first monument there, a circular ditch and bank, was dug in c2900 BC, and a timber or stone circle erected inside it. Then, much later, in c2400 BC, the first monoliths of local rock were brought in. Over the course of the next several hundred years, stones were put up, taken down, moved around, added to, and then finally re-erected to the shape we see today. Stonehenge is undeniably a stone circle, but it's not a henge, even though it has lent its name to the group of monuments that go under that title. The concept of the 'henge' was introduced by a man called Thomas Kendrick in 1932 and technically, a henge is a circular earthen bank with a ditch inside it and one or more entrances through the bank. At Stonehenge, there is a circular bank, but it is inside a ditch, so these elements are the wrong way round. Nevertheless, stone circles and henges do appear to be connected parts of a tradition that developed in Britain from around 3000 to 2000 BC - in other words, during the later Neolithic period (when agriculture began here) and moving into the earlier Bronze Age (when we see the first use of metals, from about 2400 BC). Stone circles are often positioned within henges, sometimes in replacement for earlier timber circles, so there is a link between the two types of monument, though it's not an absolutely clear one, as Richard Bradley explains: \"Henges and stone circles are separate things that often coalesce. You've got plenty of stone circles that don't have henges, and plenty of henges that don't have stone circles. They each can pursue an independent existence but they are both different expressions of a more basic idea that special places ought to be circular, which seems quite natural to us, but large parts of Europe don't have circular monuments in prehistory.\"",
        "target_summary": "Stonehenge, the most famous of Britain's 1,000 stone circles, began with a circular ditch and bank around 2900 BC, with stones added and rearranged over centuries. Although it lent its name to 'henges,' Stonehenge is not technically one, as a true henge has a ditch inside its bank, not outside. Stone circles and henges are connected monument traditions that developed in Britain from 3000-2000 BC, both reflecting a prehistoric idea that special places should be circular.",

The 27th Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival in this north-eastern Chinese city is the biggest ever, an incredible demonstration of the same industrial-scale creativity that was on display at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. The riverfront and streets are lined with hundreds of intricate ice sculptures, including a full-size replica of a Disney castle. At night, lit by multi-coloured lasers and lanterns, the effect is magical. This year's festival also sees Harbin reclaim its past, via a frozen re-creation of the St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church. A legacy of the time before World War II when the city was home to 100,000 Russians, the church was destroyed in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. \"For my parents' generation, that sculpture brings back many memories,\" says Zhang Qingying, a local lawyer.

Both attract dense crowds each day and both are portals to alternate realms of experience. The Wieliczka salt mine is 10km from Krak w and descends 327m underground. The Auschwitz-Birkenau museum is 40km from Krak w, and descends into one of the darkest crevices of human history. Wieliczka Salt Mine The Wieliczka Salt Mine is an intricate ant-farm of passages, chambers and underground lakes, distributed over nine levels. Enormous cavities dug or discovered by miners and explorers since the 13th Century interlink to form an underground city with bulging grey boulders for clouds and bible-black tunnels for roads. Less than 1% of the mine's 300km is open for public exploration, but this tiny fraction is large enough to include restaurants, chapels and halls that regularly host balls, art exhibitions, music concerts and even soccer tournaments.

Down here, internal compasses are thrown off-course. As you clamber up and down skewed staircases and along imperceptible gradients, you lose all sense of how far you are trespassing below normal human habitation.

For centuries, King Henry VIII was mainly remembered as an obese Pope-hater with a penchant for executing anything that moved, especially if it was married to him. But the revival of interest in Tudor-era London, inspired by the success of the recent drama series The Tudors, has also transformed Henry s portly image in unexpected ways. He is now a sex symbol. Jonathan Rhys Meyers's young Henry is a suave lothario, prowling the streets of Tudor London in pursuit of his next mistress. And the city itself, portrayed in the series as a seething cesspit of murder, intrigue and passion, more than lives up to its ruler's charisma. While much has inevitably changed since Henry's reign, the outline of Tudor London is still visible within the sprawl of the modern city. The obvious place to start is at the Tower of London (www.hrp.org.uk/toweroflondon), sitting ominously on the edge of today's financial district. Previously used as a royal residence, Henry transformed it into a death-row prison. His second wife, Anne Boleyn, was executed here in 1536. Visitors can see the royal Crown Jewels and graffiti purported to have been scratched into the wall by the nine-day Queen, Lady Jane Grey, beheaded in 1554. Henry's bloodlust was matched only by his love for opulent palaces. The Thames was lined with the turrets of royal residences, from the Palace of Whitehall - whose only remaining section, the Banqueting House, is at the corner of Horse Guards Avenue (hrp.org.uk/banquetinghouse) - to Hampton Court in Richmond (www.hrp.org.uk/hamptoncourtpalace). Here, no less than five Henry VIII impersonators are on hand to show visitors around the King's Apartments, Tudor kitchens and the notoriously tricky maze. The young Henry's favourite Palace, however, was at Greenwich, where he held lavish parties and jaunting contests. The Palace was demolished in the 17th Century, but its remains continue to be found - a section of the tiled floor of the Tudor chapel was discovered in 2006. Artefacts from the Palace are on display at the \"Discover Greenwich\" visitor centre (www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org/discover-greenwich), which also offers the chance to try on a suit of Tudor armour.",

Hotel Boulderado, Boulder Unlike most historic hotels, the construction of Hotel Boulderado was not a venture of a single tycoon. It was funded by local business owners. Though privately owned today, the Boulderado maintains much of its 1909 look, with antique furniture and the original cherry wood staircase. The hotel even operates its original Otis elevator, which a staff member must manually operate between floors. Past guests include Robert Frost and Helen Keller. Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong also found rooms here in the 1960s when few Boulder hotels accepted black guests.

Historically, Portuguese, Indian, Persian and Arab traders used this port as their starting point for accessing East Africa. This jumble of merchants and explorers helped create the ethnic mix of Mombasa s population and the physical chaos of the city s layout. Here, a long stretch of Chinese-built concrete boxes; there, a mosque built by a nostalgic imam from Tunis in the style of his North African home; around the way, a series of souks, alleys and cobblestone walkways thick enough for a donkey to pass through, overhung with canvas to protect Gujarati candy merchants and Digo witch doctors from the white equatorial sun. And dominating the entire city is Fort Jesus, a castle made of coral by colonizing Portuguese. Mombasa can be dangerous to walk around after hours, but when the sun rises we recommend eating a breakfast of maharagwe (beans cooked with coconut) and chapatti bread. The ubiquitous foodstuff on the Kenyan coast is a synthesis of local and foreign ingredients. The adventure of the Kenyan coast is unfortunately matched by the ugliest sort of overdevelopment in the form of full-service Swahili-chic resorts. But smart, sustainable tourism projects exist as well, even in places chok-a-block with large hotels like popular Diani Beach. For example, the Colobus Trust (www.colobustrust.org) resembles a jungle playground, overhanging with vines and ropes, all a set piece and sanctuary for the adorable Angolan Black-and-White Colobus monkey. Further south of Diani, Kaya Kinondo (kaya-kinondo-kenya.com) is the protected kaya, or sacred forest, of the local Digo Mijikenda tribe.

Think of Sri Lanka and, aside from images of Tamil Tiger strife, it might be hard to picture anything except palm trees, azure seas and sumptuous white sand beaches. And it is true that sinking into the sands of Mirissa or Bentota, you might be tempted to do little more strenuous than ordering a Lion lager for the remainder of your stay. But if you can summon the energy to wrest yourself from its sandy southern reaches, there is more to see than sea on this stellar island, whose architectural heritage is as rich and varied as its boutique hotels  fine dining menus. The obvious first step on a Sri Lanka architectural itinerary is the 17th-century walled Galle Fort, one of seven Unesco World Heritage sites on the island, and set just steps away from those glorious beaches on the south coast. Originally founded in the 16th Century by the Portuguese, work commenced in earnest on the fort in 1663 under Dutch colonial rule, when it became the country's primary port. Its maritime significance seeped away once Sri Lanka was ceded to the British in 1796, but the fort today, comprising 36 seafront hectares, remains part of a living, working city. Admire its architecture simply by wandering the streets, before taking a trip out to examine the 19th-century frescoes at the nearby Kataluwa Purvarama Mahavihara Buddhist temple, nestled in dense forest and originally built in the 13th Century. For stunning views out over both fort and sea, return to complete a full round of the Galle Fort walls at dusk, then replenish with tasty fusion cuisine at the Galle Fort Hotel, once a gem of a merchant's mansion. Travelling upcountry to Kandy, the green hill country heart of Sri Lanka, the architectural legacy moves from colonial to religious, with Buddhist structures in abundance. Step in line with numerous pilgrims in Kandy's Unesco-rated Sacred City to visit the Dalada Maligawa, also known as the Temple of the Tooth and home to the country's most important Buddhist relic - allegedly a tooth of the Buddha. Then, to peruse the city's colonial past (it fell to the British in 1815) ramble the lanes of the British Garrison Cemetery, whose deaths, detailed on carved Victorian headstones and including sun stroke, jungle fever and rampaging elephants, paint a fascinating picture of colonial perils. Slightly farther afield, Sri Lanka's so-called \"cultural triangle\" - comprising the area bounded by Kandy, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa - hosts Sri Lanka's most celebrated archaeological and cultural sites, and four more of its Unesco World Heritage sites. Ponder civilisations long-past at Polonnaruwa, home to the ruins of a 12th-century ruler's elaborate garden city; gape at the remains of the 5th-century city of Sigiriya, built into and atop a massive granite peak. Explore the palaces and monasteries of the Sacred City of Polonnaruwa, and wander the mural-filled cave monastery of Dambulla. And even back on the south coast, hidden behind the heat and horn-honking of Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, you will also find a trove of architectural treasures, many legacies of the country's melting-pot religious heritage. Savour the century old, candy-striped Jami-Ul-Alfa Mosque, explore the 19th-century Kelaniya Raja Mahar Vihara Buddhist temple, visit the Sri Kailawasanathar Swami Devasthanam Hindu temple - the oldest in town - then look in on the shrine of St. Anthony's Church, where devotees stand in line to deposit offerings to its Technicolor shrines. Meanwhile, for something more modern, detour to the Lionel Wendt Centre to examine the contemporary art on display, then, come nightfall, see the light-dressed silhouettes of the Seema Malakaya on Beira Lake, two island pavilions designed in 1985, one filled with bronze Thai Buddhas and the other centred around a sacred bodhi tree.",

For years, I'd heard about Santiago's beauty from friends and fellow travellers who had gazed upon its towering church spires and twisting honey-coloured lanes. Yet, one of the great ironies is that many of those who had walked for weeks or even months to get there admitted that once they arrived, they shuffled alongside the masses into the cathedral to see the tomb of St James, slumped into one of the many touristy tapas bars around Rua Franco and then quickly headed home.

Two armies have glared at each other across the DMZ for more than 50 years, ever since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Established on the ceasefire line at the end of the Korean War in 1953, this is where negotiations between North and South took place. Only an armistice was signed at the end of the war, not a full peace treaty. The 4km-wide DMZ scars the land from coast to coast and divides the Korean Peninsula into two antagonistic countries. It is probably the most heavily fortified border in the world - high fences topped with barbed wire, watchtowers, an antitank wall and obstacles. Thousands of landmines line both sides of the DMZ. Seeing the military build-up on both sides, a visit here is a sobering experience.

Walk to the far end and step into North Korean territory - a strange feeling. North Korean soldiers used to peer in the windows, but recently they have kept watch from a distance.

        "content": "The Great Temple of Ramses II was rediscovered two hundred years ago, carved out of a mountain on the Niles  banks. The structure is a shrine to the pharaoh and primeval Egyptian gods. In his day, Ramses II built entire cities, but nothing would have been as awe-inspiring as the Great Temple which was stumbled across in the depths of the Egyptian desert near the border of Nubia, buried under centuries of sand. No temple has such ancient, in-built heart and soul, and none have matched its passionate, modern-day story of discovery and rescue. The Great Temple was first carved out of the mountain on the west bank of the Nile between 1274 and 1244BC, Ramses II's imposing temple was as much dedicated to the deified pharaoh himself as to the primeval Egyptian gods Ra-Horakhty, Amun and Ptah. Over the centuries both the Nile and the desert sands imperceptibly shifted, and this temple was lost to the world until 1813, when it was accidentally rediscovered by the Swiss explorer Jean-Louis Burckhardt. The four colossal statues of the pharaoh fronting the temple were like gigantic sentinels watching over the incoming traffic from the south, undoubtedly designed as a warning to the strength of the pharaoh. When the temple was discovered, nearly 200 years ago, only one of the heads was completely showing above the sand, the next head was broken off and, of the remaining two, only the crowns could be seen. Enough sand was cleared away in 1817 by Giovanni Belzoni for the temple to be entered. However, by the end of the century, plans were afoot to dam the Nile and it looked as though the Great Temple was doomed to be buried again, although on this occasion its coverage was intended to be water. As the plans for the High Dam were drawn up, worldwide attention focused on the many valuable and irreplaceable ancient monuments that would be destroyed by the waters of Lake Nasser. Between 1960 and 1980 the Unesco- Nubian Rescue Campaign gathered expertise and financing from more than 50 countries, and sent Egyptian and foreign archaeological teams to Nubia. Necropolises were excavated, all portable artefacts and relics were removed to museums and, while some temples disappeared beneath the lake, 14 were salvaged. Ten of them, including the temple complexes of Philae, Kalabsha and Abu Simbel, were dismantled stone by stone and painstakingly rebuilt on higher ground. Four others were donated to the countries that contributed to the rescue effort, including the splendid Temple of Dendur, now reconstructed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Perhaps the greatest achievement of all was the preservation of the temples at Abu Simbel. Ancient magnificence and skill met with equally impressive modern technology as, at a cost of about $40 million, Egyptian, Italian, Swedish, German and French archaeological teams cut the temples up into more than 2,000 huge blocks, weighing from 10 to 40 tonnes each, and reconstructed them inside an artificially built mountain, 210m away from the water and 65m higher than the original site. The temples were carefully oriented to face the original direction, and the landscape of their original environment was re-created on and around the concrete, dome-shaped mountain. The project took just over four years. The temples of Abu Simbel were officially reopened in 1968 while the sacred site they had occupied for more than 3,000 years disappeared beneath Lake Nasser. A plaque to the right of the temple entrance eloquently describes this achievement: \"Through this restoration of the past, we have indeed helped to build the future of mankind.\" In October every year, the first rays of the rising sun reach across the Nile, penetrate the temple and move along the hypostyle hall, through the vestibule and into the sanctuary, where they illuminate the somewhat mutilated figures of Ra-Horakhty, Ramses II and Amun. Ptah is never illuminated. Before the temple was moved, this would occur one day earlier. The article 'Abu Simbel: The great temple of Egypt' was published in partnership with Lonely Planet.",

The Dubai Museum is a must-see attraction in Dubai, not only for the ancient building in which it is housed, but also for its engaging exhibits. The museum's collection vividly charts Dubai's rapid progress from a tiny pre-oil fishing and pearling village - and one of the world's first free-trade ports - through to the Arabian metropolis it is today. A couple of hours spent here before exploring the rest of Dubai really help give a sense of the city's speed of evolution. Housed in the majestic Al-Fahidi Fort, built to defend Dubai Creek around 1787, it is the oldest building in the area. The structure is made from sea rocks and gypsum, and served as both residence to Dubai's rulers and the seat of government until 1971, when it became a museum. Its manageable size and entertaining exhibits give you a quick and comprehensive introduction to Dubai's history, culture and traditions. Apart from the kitsch dioramas and disturbingly lifelike mannequins, highlights include finds from the Al-Qusais archaeological site dating back to between 2500 BC and 500 BC. Visitors enjoy posing with the disconcertingly lifelike mannequins in the museum's whimsical dioramas. Leading the Bedouin's beloved beast of burden seems to be the most popular photo opportunity, but try to resist playing Indiana Jones with the safari-suited archaeologists. The long-suffering guards have given up trying to stop people posing for photos with the kitsch mannequins - so fire away. In the fort's courtyard are several small wooden boats and traditional barasti (palm-leaf) houses, including the primitive Al Kaimah, and the summerhouse Al Areesh with traditional wind-tower (barajeel) \"air conditioning\". Step inside and test it out - you'll really notice the difference if visiting on a balmy day. Within the fort's walls are fascinating weapon displays featuring beautiful old silver khanjars (curved daggers) with camel-bone decoration, and swords inscribed with calligraphy. You will also find exhibits on traditional Emirati dances and musical instruments. Don't miss the shekhlelah, a skirt hung with goat's hooves that makes music when you shake your hips. The real treats are found in the underground museum exhibits beneath the fort, featuring a multimedia presentation on Dubai's extraordinary development through the series of dioramas brought to life by excellent use of audio and hologram-like video projections. The vivid scenes represent life in the souq, Islam, education, social life, architecture, costumes and jewellery, the desert and oasis, water and survival, and the popular \"underwater\" sea exhibition.

        "title": "Helmut Schmidt: Germany s Anglophile Chancellor",
        "content": "On 5 July 1957 the Bundestag voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Treaties of Rome, which are still at the heart of today s European Union. Not all Germany s parliamentarians played along. The young Helmut Schmidt   a brash, chain-smoking Social Democrat from Hamburg   refused to support the Treaties, largely because of British non-participation.  Much as I was convinced of the necessity of European integration , he later reflected,  I then thought   that the EEC could never be successful in the absence of British experience and pragmatism.  At the time, Schmidt   who later became West German chancellor from 1974 to 1982   reflected the views of many continental politicians who looked for British help and leadership in the rebuilding of Europe. Born in 1918 and growing up in the port city of Hamburg, Schmidt had been exposed to British life and culture from an early age: his first trip abroad had been a three-week school exchange to Manchester in July 1932. In the immediate postwar years, Schmidt s political socialisation was decisively furthered by the British regional commissioner in Hamburg, Sir Vaughan Berry, who frequently initiated informal Anglo-German tea parties with politically interested young locals. Such contacts were part of the reason why Schmidt soon acquired a reputation as an unabashed  Atlanticist , who prioritised the Federal Republic s links to the Anglo-American world over Franco-German relations. On the eve of Schmidt s election in May 1974, the British Foreign Office predicted golden times for the British-German relationship, hoping that Schmidt s Germany might align itself more closely with Britain rather than France. Such hopes were misguided. During his eight years in office, Schmidt developed an exceptionally close partnership with the French President Val ry Giscard d Estaing, which resulted in major European initiatives, such as the creation of the European Council and the European Monetary System. Britain, by contrast, often seemed aloof from and dejected by this revitalised Franco-German axis, as Schmidt clashed heavily and repeatedly with his British counterparts, such as Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher, over key issues of EC politics. In later years, he appeared scornful about Britain s supposedly destructive role in the European politics of the 1970s, explaining Wilson s and Thatcher s sceptical attitude towards the EC through a more general British Euroscepticism, allegedly ingrained in British history and culture.  The Queen, the Commonwealth and the special relationship with the US is much more important than Europe , he asserted in one of his last interviews in December 2013, exclaiming that de Gaulle had been  right  in vetoing British membership during the 1960s. What changed? Yet, the real story of the British-German relationship during Schmidt s years in office is more complicated than his clich -laden recollections suggest. At the heart of Schmidt s frequent clashes with his British counterparts was not a seemingly eternal British aversion to all things European, as Schmidt would have it. The history of British-German relations under Schmidt is not one of unilateral obstructionism, but one of mutual misperceptions and misunderstandings, which can be explained by the two countries  different paths towards the European integration process after 1945. Gold Conference of Finance Ministers of the EEC countries: the UK s Denis Healey, West Germany s Helmut Schmidt and the Nethertlands  Wim Duisenberg, by Rob Mieremet, 22 April 1974. Nationaal Archief. Public Domain. Many of the deeper reasons behind the frequent bilateral clashes over Europe in the 1970s can be found in the decades prior to Schmidt s chancellorship. His initial Anglophilia was certainly sincere. In the early 1960s, he even wrote a couple of highly polemical newspaper articles in which he criticised the French and German governments for pushing ahead with the European integration process without British involvement:  Hitler also underestimated England , one headline read. As Schmidt rose through Germany s political ranks in the 1960s, however, he started to approach the European question from a more strategic angle, which made him realise the paramount importance of France to the European project. Much like Konrad Adenauer, West Germany s first chancellor, Schmidt now argued that his country s exposed geostrategic location at the centre of Europe and its unique historical burden made it a strategic necessity to embed its postwar foreign policy firmly into a multilateral European framework, thereby making Germany s political and economic resurgence palatable to its neighbours. The relationship with France, Schmidt came to believe, was the foundation for Germany s postwar rehabilitation. By the mid-1960s, Schmidt had therefore reversed his position on British EC membership almost completely.  Given its particular interests and its resulting tight bonds to France , he wrote at the time of Britain s second EC application in 1967, German simply could not  act as a battering ram and immediately open up the door to the EC for the English by exercising pressure on Paris . But it was a position determined by Schmidt s calculating head rather than his Anglophile heart: the EC was imaginable without Britain; it was unimaginable without France. A difficult role to define The British perspective on postwar European integration was rather different. In the 1950s, British reactions to the various integration initiatives contemplated on the continent had ranged from indifference to hostility: perhaps for them, but definitely not for us. Instead, Britain s postwar strategy was based on consolidating and maintaining the country s global role: not without reason, when roughly half of its trade was still conducted with the Commonwealth. Confronted with the country s postwar decline and facing the realities of a rapidly emerging European trading bloc on the continent, however, Britain s political leaders soon changed their minds and applied twice for EEC membership: under Harold Macmillan in 1961-3 and Harold Wilson in 1967. But these applications were driven largely by negative motivations: if you can t beat them, join them. The subsequent vetoes by de Gaulle added insult to injury, leaving Britain without a progressive European policy for much of the 1960s. When Britain eventually joined the EC in January 1973, it therefore had to define its role in an institutional framework that had already consolidated itself and to accept rules and mechanisms that often seemed ill-suited to Britain s interests and preferences. By the time of Schmidt s election in May 1974, then, British and German attitudes towards the EC had evolved very differently over two decades. For 1970s Germany, EC membership had come to signify the country s postwar political and economic rehabilitation; for Britain, by contrast, it seemed to symbolise the country s postwar decline and transformation into a medium-sized European power. It did not help that Britain joined the EC on the eve of a global economic crisis, with rapidly rising food prices and double-digit inflation dominating much of Britain s first decade inside the EC. Membership was not the economic panacea various governments had portrayed it to be. Helmut Schmidt, 9 July 1982. Nationaal Archief. Public Domain. These factors pointed to future problems for the British-German relationship under Schmidt. He may have wrapped his personal attachment to the European integration process in less idealistic language than most, but he had nonetheless become firmly attached to the EC as the major strategic framework for Germany s postwar rehabilitation. That is why he reacted strongly whenever he felt the EC s cohesion or past achievements were under threat. British leaders, by contrast, lacked a comparably powerful imperative for EC membership. They approached the issue from a much more transactional and, at times, openly antagonistic angle   even if it meant prolonged crises with their European partners. Take Wilson s  renegotiation & referendum  ploy in 1974-5, for example. From Wilson s perspective, it was a clever strategy to appease the formidable anti-EC wing of his Labour Party while, in the long run, ensuring Britain s continuing membership. To Schmidt, however, Wilson s approach seemed like a cynical prioritisation of narrow party political interests at the expense of his European partners. That is why he ganged up with Giscard to ensure that the renegotiations amounted to some cosmetic changes only. Wilson s strategy paid off domestically, as the 1975 referendum result testifies. But the price was a fundamental deterioration of German trust in Britain s commitment to Europe. Margaret Thatcher s resolute attempts to reduce Britain s disproportionately high contributions to the EC budget reveals similar dynamics. For Thatcher, the budget issue was a major obstacle that had to be solved first, if Britain was to play a full and active role inside the EC, whereas Schmidt regarded her single-minded pursuit of the budget question as a fundamental challenge to the EC s principles and foundations. This is why Thatcher s attempts to get Schmidt on her side backfired so dramatically, even though Germany would also probably have gained from any major reform of the EC s financing structures. Schmidt, however, saw Germany s high budget contributions as a short-term economic price for a long-term strategic gain: the EC s political cohesion and stability. It was a logic that worked well from a German perspective; it failed to convince many British observers. Thatcher moves closer The irony is that Thatcher s first years in office saw Britain move closer to Europe than ever before. At the same time that the prime minister was demanding  her money back  in Brussels, she also worked tirelessly behind the scenes to foster joint European positions within the transatlantic alliance against the background of the so-called  second  Cold War. In the major transatlantic crises over NATO s dual-track decision, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Siberian gas pipeline project, Thatcher frequently defended European viewpoints in Washington   much to the dismay of her American counterpart Ronald Reagan. But it was the Iron Lady who usually caught the headlines in Germany and who stands tall as the supreme embodiment of British Euroscepticism, even today. The frequent fights between Schmidt and his British rivals did not therefore signify a more general British aversion to all things European, as Schmidt would suggest so frequently in later years. Indeed, Britain had played a vital and proactive role in the reconstruction of Europe ever since the late 1940s, as its role in the establishment of the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) and NATO testifies. The reason why intra-EC tensions have nonetheless come to dominate perceptions of the British-German relationship after 1945 can again be found in the particular historical context of postwar Europe. For most Germans of Schmidt s generation, the European project exerted a strong emotional pull that stretched far beyond the concrete advantages of a customs union: it offered a unique opportunity to rehabilitate and reinvent postwar Germany within a European framework and to distance itself from the horrors of the recent past. Wilson and Thatcher, by contrast, may have concluded rationally that EC membership was in Britain s national interest, but they lacked any comparative emotive and personal attachment to the European project. The EC therefore remained only one of many possible arenas for European cooperation in 1970s Britain   and not one that suited the country particularly well. For most Germans, however, the EC had by that time become the only framework for European cooperation. Any criticisms of its institutions and policies were almost inevitably interpreted as more general attacks on the very principles of European cooperation and solidarity. This is the big European misunderstanding that lies at the heart of British-German relations under Schmidt. Today s European Union bears rather little resemblance to the EC of the 1970s. Nonetheless, some of the key dynamics tearing Britain and Germany apart in the 1970s can still be witnessed in contemporary debates over  Brexit : Britain is still ill at ease with many of the EU s most basic institutional characteristics and principles, whereas Germany seems anxious to preserve the EU s substance and cohesion, even at significant cost. It is thus tempting to read Schmidt s journey as merely one episode of a much longer history where the European integration process has acquired an importance for Germany which   for various reasons   has never been replicated in Britain. Yet Schmidt s story also shows that these different British and German perspectives were the result of the specific historical context of the immediate postwar decades and that they centred primarily on the concrete mechanisms and dynamics of the European Community in the 1970s. They should not be treated as evidence of an allegedly eternal British Euroscepticism, deeply rooted in British culture and history, contrary to Schmidt s musings in later years.

Perhaps it is a coincidence, but in the spring of 1848   four years after Samuel Morse tapped out those first words in code and sent them out into the silence   the dead started tapping out messages to the living too. It happened in upstate New York where the Fox family had recently moved. Their farmhouse was said to be haunted; a spirit was heard knocking in the night. The two youngest daughters, Catherine and Margaretta, both adolescents, discovered that if they asked questions the spirit would knock in reply. It revealed itself to belong to a 31-year-old man. Neighbours came to listen. Someone had the idea of reciting the alphabet to help the spirit speak.  One Tuesday night, at twelve o clock , the girls  mother recalled him revealing, he  was murdered by having its throat cut with a butcher knife . Spiritualism, and with it the ritual of the s ance, was born. It was a  spiritual telegraph , a friend said. The fame of the Fox sisters spread.

By the late 1860s there were some 11 million spiritualists in the US alone. Fame took its toll on the Fox sisters, however. In 1888 Margaretta, widowed and alcoholic, gave an interview to the New York Herald.  Is it all a trick?  the journalist asked.  Absolutely , Margaretta replied.  Spirits, is he not easily fooled?  As a child, she explained, she learned to make the sounds using the joints in her feet. A sense of sadness pervades the interview.  The spirits will not come back , she said of the dead.

        "content": "The Portuguese pioneered trans-Atlantic slavery, trafficking more people than any other nation and continuing to do so decades after Britain s abolition of the trade in 1807. Yet the country s first, long-promised, memorial to victims of slavery   Angolan artist Kiluanji Kia Henda s  Plantation   Prosperity and Nightmare    only materialised in Lisbon in 2021. As is the case in other countries with a shameful history of involvement with the slave trade, discussions of that history can be contentious.  Those who question the narrative are called  woke  and face arguments such as  it was the British Empire that was racist, not ours , explained historian Pedro Cardim in 2023. The question  what about Portugal?  has likewise been posed by those seeking to decentre Britain s own history of participation in the slave trade. These two books from historians immersed in the lusophone colonial world bookend the beginning and end of Portuguese involvements in the Atlantic slave trade. In The Heretic of Cacheu Toby Green explores the minutiae of everyday interactions among Portuguese slave traders, mixed-heritage middle-women, and African chiefdoms in a town where trans-Atlantic slave-trading was taking off in the early 17th century. In Worlds of Unfreedom, Roquinaldo Ferreira develops a similarly fine-grained account of Portuguese traffickers  relationships with Africans at a time when abolitionism was threatening the economic dominance of all those complicit in that trade. Green s story is centred on the arrest and Inquisitorial trial for heresy of Crispina Peres, a woman of Portuguese and Bainuk descent, who was married to the former captain-general of Cacheu in today s Guinea-Bissau, in the mid-1600s. Like most of the town s elite, Peres both owned domestic slaves and traded captives to the Portuguese  market . The latter were obtained primarily by armed groups known as gampisas in the interior, and by Bijag  islanders who lived on the offshore archipelago and raided mainland communities. Local and more distant African polities   the Bainuk, Pepel, Flouk, Mandinga, Jolof, and Ser er   variously avoided, resisted, or profited from the Atlantic trade networks. One of Green s key insights is how tenuous the boundary was between the different forms of slavery in Cacheu. Societies in West Africa had long practised a domestic form of enslavement for war captives and those born into slavery. These captives survived within the owner s household in relationships of dependency, subject always to their caprice. But the slavery introduced by the Portuguese was different. It entailed the reduction of captives to the status of commodity for export. Green writes that Peres had  a clear understanding of the hatred that underlay her daily interactions  with the enslaved in her household, but exploited their  terrible fear of being sold into Atlantic trafficking . Household slavery in Cacheu was at least preferable to the Middle Passage. The town s social hierarchy rested on free people s attempts to mark their free status and enslaved peoples  efforts to demonstrate their value to local owners and avoid being sold to the traffickers. Green describes life in Cacheu in far more detail than historians of local colonial societies usually manage thanks largely to the Inquisition records of witnesses  interrogation for Peres  trial in Lisbon in 1665. They included some of Peres  own household slaves. One of them, Sabasti o Rodrigues Barraza, claimed that he had denounced Peres because he had been promised his freedom by her accusers. These included two of Peres  major commercial rivals and the main instigator, the disgraced priest Luis Rodrigues, who had himself been arrested by the Inquisition for soliciting women in the confession booth. Together these men conspired to denounce Peres for the  use of African healing and knowledge  which, they knew, would be interpreted in Lisbon as an assault on empire. Her real crime, Green argues, was her challenge to these Portuguese men s dominance of the local slave trading economy. Having spent three years in the Inquisitorial jail, Peres died soon after her return to Cacheu in 1668. Ferreira s account takes place two centuries later and more than 2,000 miles south in Angola, the main source of captives for the by-then illicit slave trade. As the Portuguese historian Jo o Pedro Marques has suggested, the imperial authorities adopted a gradualist approach after British abolition in 1807, partly as a  cautious guarantee  to Portugal s domestic antislavery campaigners, and partly to assuage pressure from abroad. The loss of Brazil as the main source of demand for Portuguese trafficking after 1822 meant that the empire had less to lose from enforcing abolition and more to gain by taking some of the initiative back from Britain. Enforcing abolition of the Atlantic trade also enabled Portugal to retain captive labour within its African colonies. Like the British and French, the Portuguese were intent by the mid-19th century on extracting Africa s raw materials. They learned from the British how to use antislavery initiatives to pursue this new post-slavery project, invading the Kongo kingdom and taking control of the Bembe copper mines in 1856 on the pretext of suppressing slavery before the British could do so. Their  antislavery  military expedition conveniently carried mining equipment. Abolition thus became  a tool for the creation of new forms of unfreedom . As one French official explained, referring to the British practice of forcing Africans  liberated  from slave ships to work elsewhere in its empire,  England herself gives us an example , the only difference being that the  French bought their captives on land and the English seized theirs at sea and forced them to emigrate . The Portuguese justified the removal of African men and women from Angola to work on the coffee plantations of S o Tom  and Pr ncipe by invoking the British example of forcing  apprentices  from Sierra Leone to work on Caribbean sugar plantations. Both authors take great care to emphasise the agency of African people. Ferreira tells the intriguing story of Eufrazina, an enslaved African woman whom the Luanda businesswoman and slave trader Dona Ana Joaquina sent as envoy to negotiate a treaty with the powerful Lunda Kingdom. Anticipating the supply of captives for the Atlantic trade drying up, Joaquina hoped to initiate and monopolise a new trade in wax, ivory, and captives purely for the local market. British officials praised her for leading  the only attempt to give capital a more wholesome direction  by developing sugar production using locally enslaved African labour. But both books are obliged, ultimately, to recognise the limited ability of their African protagonists to challenge a highly militarised and increasingly rich and powerful Europe. At both the beginning and the end of slavery, West Africa s economies were reoriented around European demands, first for the extraction of captives, and then for the exploitation of land and labour in situ. In the meantime, between the 1650s and the 1850s, mixed-race elites had more power in the Portuguese slave-trading entrep ts than one might expect. In 1836, Benguela s Portuguese governor lamented that:  Every time that elections have taken place ... those elected have always been either blacks or mixed-race individuals [pardos], and whites have been excluded.  The resistance that Portugal encountered from these groups as it abolished its slave trade and developed as a territorial colonial power is a key part of the region s history, as Ferreira s book shows. Together these painstakingly researched studies recreate a world in which slavery was a significant but widely disavowed part of everyday life.

        "title": "El General simo  by Giles Tremlett book review",
        "content": "The bloody victor of the Spanish Civil War continues to evoke controversy. When, in 2011, Spain s Royal Academy of History, under the supervision of a former Franco loyalist, published a dictionary describing Franco as  authoritarian, but not a dictator , the backlash raged for years. The past quarter-century of Spanish public life has been shaped by so-called  memory wars  in which both the intransigent left and right have politicised attempts to identify the mass graves of republican dead and unveil the convenient silence ( pact of oblivion ) which overlay the latter two-thirds of Spain s 20th century. Franco s regime has been presented as authoritarian (Juan Linz), genocidal (Helen Graham), and fascistic in inception (Paul Preston). The regime s apologists presented the personal rule of Western Europe s last dictator as developmentalist, providential, even as an  organic democracy . In this biography, Giles Tremlett describes Franco as  a giant dam, determined to control the flow of Spanish history . However, 50 years after his death in November 1975,  what surprises is not the size of the dam that was opened after he died, but the ideological emptiness that lay behind it . Mediocre, incurious, and obsequious towards his Axis patrons, Franco had none of the charisma of Mussolini or Mao, nor any of the avuncular qualities of the sister regime of Salazar in Portugal. It is faint praise to rate him less fanatically murderous than Adolf Hitler, or less tyrannically ruthless than Joseph Stalin (even though Franco possessed as much internal power as Europe s bloodiest totalitarians). Tremlett s Franco is a cautious, ambitious, and unthinkingly authoritarian man, youthfully brave in Spanish Morocco, callously attritional in middle age leading the rebels to victory in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), and vindictive and shifty in the grey areas of politics thereafter. Unrivalled at dividing and ruling allies and enemies alike, he was also prone to delusions which only his peculiar luck prevented from unravelling his regime at home and abroad. Tremlett explains Franco s formative years without imposing 21st-century psychology on the patriarchal norms and family hypocrisies of 1890s Spain. He was born to a doting mother and a wayward (later estranged) father in Ferrol, a Galician port city where the navy was everything in a Spain where it was nothing. Franco s childhood was forged by the upheavals of the turn of the century. The loss of Spain s major colonies in the war of 1898 fired up a generation of army officers determined to restore national honour in new campaigns to extend Spanish control over the northern part of Morocco. Like so many of his generation, Franco believed in ill-focused national  regeneration    and in the responsibility of the army to achieve it. As a young officer Franco excelled. Despite his social awkwardness, he married into a higher social rank in 1917. His subordinates and officer comrades respected his battlefield bravery and at 31 Franco became Europe s youngest general since Napoleon. The Second Republic (1931-36) alienated his naturally conservative and Catholic instincts. But unlike other leading army plotters (Sanjurjo, Mola, Queipo de Llano, et al.) Franco was politically malleable. He was neither too monarchical, nor too Carlist, nor too fascist, nor too republican: these factors as much as his command of elite troops in Spanish Morocco made him General simo ten weeks into the Civil War. In addition to his clever operations marching on Madrid in October 1936 and his direct diplomacy with Hitler, Franco was a soldier s soldier who divided right-wingers the least. But neither his allies nor his enemies imagined that the five-feet-four-inch Galician would remain in power for half a century. After the victory of 1939 Tremlett takes us into the well-trodden ground of postwar Spain. Believing until incredibly late in the Second World War that an Axis victory was likely, Franco was too slow in reverting from non-belligerent to neutral status. He aggravated his regime s postwar isolation by imposing self-defeating economic autarky and indulging the corruption of his subordinates. Another 50-or-so pages on the post-1939 era would have improved Tremlett s analysis. More could have been made of the ravages of the developmentalist frenzy of the 1940s and 1950s, including hydrology, irrigation, and resettlement schemes. The diplomatic context is largely Eurocentric: not much is made of Franco s unusually good relations with the Arab world, or the integrist links with Latin America. The economic impact of world trade and tourism is better handled. Once liberalisation finally improved the economy after 1959 Franco s regime took the credit, in a similar way to the post-Cold War Chinese Communist Party after the horrors of Maoism. Youth revolt, European cultural norms, and the defection of the Catholic Church all frayed the dictatorship in its final years. But the failure of internal and external opposition to unite, combined with the dreary apoliticism which the regime had drummed into the masses, meant that Franco died a natural death in November 1975   a remarkable achievement for one of Europe s nastiest dictators. Given Franco s remarkable agency throughout his reign, one is given to ponder the  what ifs  implicit in Tremlett s account. What if Franco s stomach wound in 1916 had proved fatal? What if his feet had stayed cold in the army plot of 1936? What if he had joined the Axis in 1940 and suffered Allied invasion as a consequence? Or, even more radically, what if he had dared to break with the Axis in the final weeks of the 1945 campaign in Western Europe and declared war on the Nazis, thereby accruing to his regime something of the cheap economic and geostrategic benefits that the left-authoritarian C rdenas regime of Mexico enjoyed in its symbolic war with Japan? In a biography as agentic as Tremlett s, one is given to wonder about Spanish history s many glaring counterfactuals.

        "title": "Chernobyl Children  by Melanie Arndt review",
        "content": "The explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on 26 April 1986 was an environmental catastrophe. The radioactive fallout contaminated territory that was home to seven million people, including three million children. It also reached Western Europe, causing an international scandal. And still, the Soviet authorities attempted to do what they always did when it came to major accidents: hush it up. For three years the state concealed the truth about the scale of the disaster from its citizens and the world. All this changed because of the children, as Melanie Arndt reveals in her book. Why, many asked, if the radiation levels supposedly posed no danger, were some children from contaminated areas being evacuated to other parts of the country? In the charged political atmosphere of the late 1980s, when glasnost turned from a slogan into actual policy, the authorities yielded to mounting public pressure. In February 1989 two main Belarusian newspapers were the first to print maps showing the extent of the radioactive contamination. Pravda followed suit six weeks later (an unprecedented reversal of the Soviet press hierarchy). The censorship ban on Chernobyl collapsed two months after that. The revelations made clear that the children living in contaminated areas needed urgent help. Initially, all eyes turned to the state, which had long boasted that it provided Soviet children with the happiest childhood in the world. As it turned out, the state could do precious little. With the economy in free fall, it had few resources available to offer the medical care required. Local authorities in Belarus and Ukraine increasingly felt abandoned by Moscow. The regime s failure to protect the children contributed to its spiralling loss of legitimacy. Caught between public anger and its own impotence, the Soviet government openly appealed for international help. In March 1990 Cuba received its first group of 139 children. Only recently itself the recipient of Soviet aid, Cuba covered all the expenses and Fidel Castro personally welcomed the children at the airport. Cuba would go on to host more than 20,000 children over the following two decades. Charity had been a dirty word in Soviet ideology, but the environmental crisis coupled with economic collapse forced a rethink. Numerous initiatives sprang up to fill the vacuum left by the dying regime, paving the way from socialist to civil society. Before that first group arrived in Cuba, a non-state initiative in Belarus had organised the first recuperative trip abroad, sending a group of children from the Belarusian village of Stralichava to India in December 1989. Many more trips to Europe, Canada, and the US would follow. Through her detailed account of this organisation, registered in November 1990 as the Belarusian Charitable Foundation for the Children of Chernobyl, Arndt traces how civil society helped turn  the Soviet Chernobyl children  into the  children of the whole world . The Belarusian Charitable Foundation was just one of several organisations that collectively sent more than one million Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Russian children abroad. While historians have shown how Chernobyl animated anti-Soviet opposition in Ukraine, Arndt s book reminds us how central the trauma has been in Belarus. Around 70 per cent of the radioactive contamination landed there, not least because the authorities in Moscow ordered that the  dirty  clouds be made to rain over Belarus in order to protect Russian and Ukrainian cities. As Arndt argues, civil society cannot exist outside of politics. Suspicious of state authority, the foundation believed that their project would have more than just health benefits for the children it sent abroad. It would help democratise Belarus, where authoritarianism returned after the election of Aliaksandr Lukashenka in 1994. His regime harassed the foundation precisely because it saw its activities in the same political light. In 1997 the KGB investigated it for four months on charges of financial irregularities and funding the opposition. After nearly 25 difficult years, the foundation ended its work in 2014. But politics also shaped the Western response, on which all efforts to help Belarusian children hinged. Civil societies across the Atlantic (Arndt s main focus) were galvanised into action, but their motivations were a tangled knot of personal agendas and politics. These were exciting times, as ordinary Americans suddenly gained an opportunity to pursue citizens  diplomacy with the former  evil empire . Despite the book s title, this is mostly a story about adults: state organisations failing to fulfil their obligations, civil society rising on the ruins of socialism, transnational humanitarian networks forming in the wake of the Cold War. Only in the final chapter do the children take centre stage, alongside their Belarusian chaperones and American hosts. It seems a pity that this essential part of the story is relegated to the finale. It is clear from the interviews and the study by two Belarusian social psychologists on which Arndt relies that the experience burst open the children s horizons. One participant remembers West Germany as  an explosion, a shock, nothing but positive emotions . Perhaps Lukashenka was right to worry. After all, the generation of former Chernobyl children challenged his regime in unprecedented mass protests that swept Belarus in 2020. The regime s botched handling of another health-related disaster, the Covid-19 pandemic, combined with anger over fraudulent elections to produce a perfect storm. But unlike Gorbachev in 1991, Lukashenka survived by resorting to brutal repression, which continues to this day. Another generation of Belarusian children now lives in the shadow of Chernobyl, but there are no transnational humanitarian networks left to offer them respite. State repression has wiped out Belarusian civil society and depleted the medical profession. The regime s collusion in Russia s war on Ukraine has sealed Belarus  isolation from the West.

        "content": "After two decades and an estimated cost of $1bn, the Grand Egyptian Museum opens its doors to the public on Tuesday. After two decades and an estimated cost of $1bn, the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) opened its doors to the public on Tuesday, just a few days after the official opening ceremony on Saturday. Regarded as the world s largest archaeological facility for a single civilisation, the museum is located 2km (1.2 miles) from the pyramids of Giza and 8km (5 miles) from the capital, Cairo. The complex spans nearly 500,000sq metres (5,381,900sq ft) and will house more than 100,000 ancient artefacts from the 30 dynasties of ancient Egypt. Some of the main attractions include the 3,200-year-old, 11.36-metre (37ft) statue of King Ramses II, the complete collection of Tutankhamun s treasures and a 4,500-year-old boat, one of the oldest intact ships in the world, belonging to Khufu, the pharaoh renowned for building the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Grand Egyptian Museum s design The museum has been called the  fourth pyramid  of the Giza Plateau, which is home to three pyramids about 4,500 years old: the Great Pyramid of Giza (built for Pharaoh Khufu), the Pyramid of Khafre (built for Pharaoh Khafre) and the Pyramid of Menkaure (built for Pharaoh Menkaure). Visitors can view the pyramids from inside the museum, which is designed in the shape of a chamfered triangle, echoing the geometry of the pyramids. The museum s north and south walls are aligned with the Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure. The design, created by the Irish architecture firm Heneghan Peng, uses sand-coloured concrete and translucent alabaster stone while the museum s main facade is made of frosted glass panels. The complex was announced in 1992, but construction did not begin until 2005 and was delayed by political turmoil after the 2011 Arab Spring and the COVID-19 pandemic. Some areas of the museum had a soft launch in 2024. The museum complex includes the main building, a conference centre, a courtyard, a Nile Valley park, the Khufu Boat Museum and a conservation centre. A look inside the museum Upon entering the museum, visitors are greeted by the 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II, which weighs about 83 tonnes.  From 1954 to 2006, the statue stood in Ramses Square in front of Cairo s main train station before being relocated to its new location near the museum. To facilitate the move, the statue was transported upright and in one piece on a specially designed 128-wheel vehicle, covering a distance of 30km (19 miles) and necessitating temporary road closures. Beyond the entrance is the six-storey grand staircase, lined with about 60 artefacts, including statues that honour deities, sarcophagi that hold the deceased, columns showcasing ancient architectural artistry,, and stelae inscribed with significant texts. The museum boasts 12 main permanent exhibition halls, which opened last year and are organised by both era (ranging from prehistory through the Greco-Roman period) and theme (including society, kingship and belief). The Tutankhamun gallery Among the museum s most prominent and largest exhibition spaces is the Tutankhamun Gallery, a 7,500sq-metre (80,000sq-ft) space that features more than 5,000 artefacts unearthed from the tomb of Tutankhamun, the boy king who ascended to the throne at about nine years old and ruled during the Eighteenth Dynasty nearly 3,400 years ago. Despite his brief reign, which ended with his unexpected death at about 18 or 19 years old, Tutankhamun is one of the most famous pharaohs, largely due to the discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922 in the Valley of the Kings on the west side of the Nile opposite the city of Luxor. Visitors can see his golden mask, throne, sarcophagus, chariots and jewellery, all presented to re-create the atmosphere of his royal burial chamber. One of the world s largest museums The Grand Egyptian Museum has about 45,000sq metres (484,000sq ft) of exhibition space, making it the sixth largest museum in the world by display area. The Louvre in Paris tops the list with 72,735sq metres, followed by the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia (66,842sq metres), the National Museum of China in Beijing (65,000sq metres), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City (58,820sq metres) and the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain (47,700sq metres). Tourism is a major source of foreign currency for Egypt. In 2024, a record 15.7 million tourists visited Egypt, and the travel and tourism sector contributed roughly 8 percent of the country s gross domestic product, according to official figures.",

        "title": "Mona Lisa to the Nazis: Robbed often, why latest Louvre theft is different",
        "content": "Experts say jewels stolen in heists from the iconic Parisian museum are harder to recover than stolen paintings, as they can be quickly broken down. The band of robbers who broke into the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning and stole eight Napoleonic pieces of priceless jewellery in a four-minute heist were just the latest in a long line of daring thieves who have targeted the iconic museum. The robbers used a truck-mounted ladder to reach the gilded Galerie d Apollon (Apollo s Gallery) on the second floor before taking an angle grinder to a window to access the French crown jewels. The heist took place at 9:30am (07:30 GMT), half an hour after the museum opened to visitors for the day. The robbers are still at large and the Louvre is currently closed. A ninth item they stole   the crown belonging to Empress Eugenie, Napoleon III s wife   was recovered nearby after it was dropped by the group, the French Ministry of the Interior said. The Louvre was a royal palace for more than two centuries. It opened as a public museum in 1793 during the French Revolution. The revolution had made totems of monarchical history especially vulnerable to looters, and the Louvre, besides giving everyday French people a glimpse of these precious items, sought to protect the legacy they represented, for future generations. That did not completely stop thieves, however. Over time, there have been several attempts to steal valuable items from the Louvre   often successful. 1911: The Mona Lisa is stolen On August 21, 1911, Leonardo da Vinci s Mona Lisa was stolen in what was deemed the  heist of the century . At the time, the Mona Lisa was one of Italian painter da Vinci s lesser-known works and had been on display since 1797. Many now say it was the theft itself that propelled the painting to its modern fame. At the time, the painting was hanging on a wall in a room called the  Salon Carre .  The heist was carried out by Vincenzo Peruggia, a 29-year-old Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre. He entered the museum completely unchallenged on the evening of August 20, clad in his old museum uniform. Peruggia hid in a storage closet overnight and, in the morning, when the museum was closed and almost empty, emerged from the closet. He simply removed the painting from the wall and wrapped it in a white sheet. As he made to leave the museum, he found the stairwell door to the courtyard locked. But instead of being suspicious, a Louvre plumber helped Peruggia to unlock the door, mistaking him for a colleague. Museum security was rather less robust back then, and paintings would often be removed for maintenance or to be photographed. Hence, no one batted an eye at the absence of the da Vinci painting for more than a day. Concern over its absence was eventually raised by a visiting artist, who came to the Salon Carre to paint. When the Louvre guards could not find the painting, police were alerted. What followed was an extensive manhunt and media frenzy. The police did not initially find many leads. Avant garde poet Guillaume Apollinaire was arrested and questioned due to his links to earlier thefts from the Louvre. Apollinaire, who was cleared of suspicion, pointed to his friend, a young Pablo Picasso, who was also questioned by the police. Picasso was cleared of suspicion in the theft of the Mona Lisa, but in a grand twist, it was revealed he had previously acquired Iberian statue heads which had been stolen from the Louvre. He returned these to the Louvre to avoid any further trouble. Rumours and speculation mounted about the painting s possible whereabouts, with many believing it was smuggled abroad. But, the whole time, the Mona Lisa was actually in Peruggia s one-bedroom apartment in Paris. It was finally recovered in 1913 when Peruggia attempted to sell it to a gallery in Italy. He believed the sale had been successful when an art dealer he was in touch with invited him to Italy for a potential sale to a gallery, and he took the painting with him. Instead of buying the painting, however, the gallery turned Peruggia in. He was arrested in his hotel room in Florence. The Mona Lisa was returned to the Louvre in 1914, and Peruggia was charged with the theft. He said he had been motivated by national pride to steal the painting, claiming the painting had been looted from Italy. The painting was actually completed in France by Da Vinci and sold to the French royal family. 1940s: The Nazis attempt to loot the Louvre In 1940, the Nazis invaded France amid World War II and appeared poised to loot a section of the Louvre.  However, as a preemptive move, Jacques Jaujard, the director of France s national museums, ordered more than 1,800 cases containing Louvre masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa, to be moved to the French countryside. This prevented a large-scale cultural loss when the Nazis marched into a largely empty museum. However, the Nazis did steal many pieces of Jewish artwork while occupying France. Many of these have been returned to France, and the Louvre began displaying them in 2018 in an attempt to reunite the stolen pieces with their original owners. 1960s to 1990s: More robberies In 1966, five pieces of antique, handmade jewellery were stolen from John F Kennedy International Airport in New York. The jewellery was en route back to Paris from the United States, having been loaned by the Louvre for a museum display in Richmond, Virginia. Detectives later recovered the jewellery in a grocery bag, and three men were arrested for receiving stolen property. In 1990, Pierre Auguste Renoir s Portrait of a Seated Woman was cut from its frame and stolen from the third floor of the Louvre. At the same time, the museum discovered that some small jewellery items were also missing   and may have been for some time.  The disappearance of these objects, which are not of great value and are often seen on the market, is certainly quite old,  the then-director of museums in France said, according to The New York Times. It is unclear whether these items were ever recovered. What s different this time? This week s jewellery heist is distinctive because previous high-profile robberies in the Louvre have largely been of paintings.  A jewellery theft is a very different thing to consider because of the high intrinsic value of the object stolen,  American art historian Noah Charney told Al Jazeera. Paintings have a non-intrinsic value, which is value assigned to them due to their cultural significance, he explained.  A painting doesn t have a high intrinsic value because it s usually made of panel and pigment, and canvas and nothing more. Whereas jewellery has a high intrinsic value because if you break down what was stolen and sell the components, the value is still significant.  With jewels, the cultural heritage value, which provides the majority of its value, is not something that the thieves are likely to take into consideration,  Charney added. Does this make stolen jewels harder to trace? Yes. Collections of jewels can be broken down, recut and sold in a way that does not link them to the intact stolen items, making them almost impossible to trace   yet very valuable. They do not even need to be on the black market if the jewels are recut significantly enough that they are not identifiable.  The only hope that police have, and we understand this from how past cases have played out, is if they offer a reward for the recovery of all the jewels intact that is higher than the value of the component parts of the jewellery,  Charney said. Such a move might buy the police a bit more time to track down the items and catch those responsible as the thieves ponder their next move.   Otherwise, I m afraid there s not much hope that these will be recovered and they would likely have been cut down within hours of the theft,  he said.",
        "target_summary": "Robbers recently stole eight Napoleonic jewelry pieces from the Louvre Museum's Galerie d'Apollon, accessing it with a truck-mounted ladder and an angle grinder, although one item was recovered nearby. Experts state that stolen jewels are harder to recover than paintings due to their high intrinsic value, allowing them to be quickly broken down, recut, and sold without being traceable. While the Louvre has a long history of thefts, including the 1911 Mona Lisa heist, this recent incident is distinctive because previous high-profile robberies primarily targeted paintings rather than high-value jewelry.",

        "content": "Beneath William & Mary s Robert M. Gates Hall, archaeologists this summer uncovered a remarkable find: the near-complete 18th-century foundation of the Williamsburg Bray School. The Bray School, one of the oldest known institutions in North America dedicated to the education of enslaved and free Black children, operated on the site from 1760 to 1765. Its foundations were thought to be only partially intact. Researchers also discovered a previously undocumented cellar, layered with centuries of artifacts. The discoveries provide a new portal into the site s past, providing a more complete story of the Williamsburg Bray School, its scholars and their impact. Archaeologists from the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research work at the dig site beneath Gates Hall. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research)  As the United States prepares to mark its 250th anniversary, William & Mary is embracing its role as a steward of the nation s origin stories   and as a catalyst for their expansion,  said W&M President Katherine A. Rowe.  The discovery of this cellar is thrilling,  Rowe added.  The roots of our city and university entwine here. Every layer of history that it reveals gives us new insights into our early republic, from the Williamsburg Bray School through the generations that followed, up through the early 20th century.  Layered with history The foundation and cellar discoveries were first made early this spring by Colonial Williamsburg Foundation (CWF) archaeologists conducting preliminary investigations for the Gates Hall renovation project. The W&M Real Estate Foundation is managing the renovation and expansion on behalf of the W&M Foundation. Since the spring, the W&M Center for Archaeological Research (the Center), under the leadership of Elizabeth J. Monroe and David Lewes, has expanded the excavation and led artifact recovery. The cellar is sizeable: approximately 36 by 18 feet. Two distinct levels are emerging. The Center team has exposed the bottom of the cellar almost eighteen inches higher than the previous depth found by the CWF team.  It looks like the cellar was a partial cellar, and had different floor levels potentially,  said Center Project Archaeologist Tom Higgins.  It s not a brick-lined cellar   it was probably dug soon after the foundations were laid.  In addition to the foundation and cellar, their work is revealing a rich archaeological story that stretches from the 18th century to the mid-20th century: jewelry, slate pencil fragments, sherds of pottery and vases, buttons   the stuff of everyday life, the ephemera of history. 19th and 20th century artifacts recovered from the cellar layers found beneath Gates Hall. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research) Each excavated layer reveals more discoveries. Among the recovered items are fragments of colonoware pottery   handmade ceramics often associated with sites of enslavement and Indigenous communities   as well as sherds of Greek Revival ceramics, glass, and decorative items linked to the women who lived in Brown Hall during the early 1900s. Before it was moved down Prince George Street in 1930, the original Williamsburg Bray School building housed Methodist women attending William & Mary from 1924-1930. These students were among the first generations of women to attend college in the U.S. The significance of these discoveries is amplified by the site s connection to the Williamsburg Bray School. Archaeologists found this sherd of glass containing a depiction of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, war and the arts. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research) A favorite recovery of the team is a sherd of glass depicting Minerva, Roman goddess of wisdom, justice, war and the arts. The Minerva sherd juxtaposes with a piece of late 19th century or early 20th century flatware, painted with a Greek meandros pattern.  We know that the girls at Brown Hall were furnishing their dorms,  Michele L. Brumfield, senior researcher at the Center, said.  So maybe they were bringing in things like this.  The team is careful not to draw too many conclusions from what they are finding   yet.  It s early days,  Monroe added. Once bagged and labeled, artifacts will travel to the lab at the Center for further study. Spaces of engagement Plans are underway to incorporate the archaeological discoveries, as well as photographs and other documents, into a permanent exhibit inside Gates Hall. The exhibit will be co-curated with members of the Williamsburg Bray School Descendant Community and other stakeholders. Their stories   once lost to the recesses of the cellar   will enlighten students and visitors. Other artifacts will be lent to The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, where they will join additional items connected to the site for display at the Colin G. and Nancy N. Campbell Archaeology Center, scheduled to open in 2026. One of the recovered artifacts appears to be a pin with tiny inlaid shells dating to the early 20th-century. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research) At Gates Hall, the intention is to outline the foundation of the original Bray School on the floor and, if possible, excavate a portion for display in the exhibit   reminders of the lives lived on the site. The renovation at Gates Hall, made possible by a $30 million gift from an anonymous alumna, represents William & Mary s commitment to addressing 21st-century challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration. The building will house the Global Research Institute, the Institute for Integrative Conservation and the Whole of Government Center of Excellence. Ann Marie Stock, presidential liaison for Strategic Cultural Partnerships, leads these collaborative efforts. She envisions a portal which will shed light on those who traversed the site over centuries:  foragers and farmers, singers and soldiers, clerks and clergy, dancers, drummers, weavers, writers, teachers, learners, and so many others, all belonged to this community through the years.

What else are we about to learn? We are not done understanding the history of the Williamsburg Bray School, the history of Black education. We are not done learning the history of this area, and we are certainly not done learning the history of this country.  Danny Devlin, Strategic Cultural Partnerships",

        "content": "New discoveries by a UCF researcher and her team at the ancient Mesopotamian site of Kurd Qaburstan, including clay tablets with ancient cuneiform writing, a game board and large structural remains, may provide a wealth of knowledge about this Middle Bronze Age city and shed light on the more hidden history of Mesopotamia. The clay tablets are the first of their kind found in the region and are still being interpreted. Early findings indicate they provide a greater insight about the people who lived there and the significantly consequential events they encountered. One of three clay cuneiform tablets discovered at the Middle Bronze Age site of Kurd Qaburstan in northeast Iraq. It was found in a debris-filled corridor in the lower town palace. Early interpretations of this tablet suggests dramatic events and possibly ancient warfare. (Photo courtesy of Tiffany Earley-Spadoni) Tiffany Earley-Spadoni, an associate professor of history at UCF, and a team of researchers have been carefully uncovering culturally significant Middle Bronze Age (1800 BCE) discoveries at Mesopotamian site of Kurd Qaburstan, which is situated in the Erbil region in northeast Iraq. A significant portion of human development and history may be traced back to the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia, in and around present-day Iraq. The study of these new tablets could reveal important details about the city s connections with its neighbors during the Middle Bronze Age and its historical significance. For example, by studying people s names, word choice and writing styles, scholars may better understand literacy in the region and the city s cultural identity, Earley-Spadoni says in her fieldwork summary. Hidden History The Middle Bronze Age in northern Iraq is poorly understood due to limited prior research and the inherent biases of the available historical sources, she says.  We hope to find even more historical records that will help us tell the story of [the city] from the perspective of its own people rather than relying only on accounts written by their enemies,  Earley-Spadoni says.  While we know a great deal about the development of writing in southern Iraq, far less is known about literacy in northern Mesopotamian cities, especially near Erbil where Kurd Qaburstan is located.  Mesopotamia, with its dense network of ancient cities in the fertile plains along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers near the Persian Gulf, is often regarded as the birthplace of urban civilization. These cities, preserved as towering tells, mounds formed by centuries of accumulated cultural debris, have captivated scholars for generations.  We know quite a bit about Mesopotamian cities in the south, and that s considered the traditional heartland of cities,  Earley-Spadoni says.  When people think about where cities first arose, they imagine cities in southern Iraq, like Uruk. We seek to fill in this gap in the scholarship by investigating a large urban site, one of the few that s ever been investigated in northern Iraq.  New Areas Uncovered, New Questions Raised Earley-Spadoni and researchers have been working in two primary areas: the northwest residential neighborhoods and a newly discovered administrative complex identified as a lower town palace, which was theorized to exist based on findings made in 2022. Researchers used technologies such as magnetometry, which allows researchers to peer through the ground to see architectural plans, to help excavate the site. The research is valuable its own right and helps shed light on regional history and worldwide heritage, she says.  The focus of the research is the organization of ancient cities, and it s specifically the organization of Kurd Qaburstan,  Earley-Spadoni says.  You may have heard of King Hammurabi, who erected the famous law code. So, this is about that same time almost 4,000 years ago. We decided that this would be an interesting place to investigate what it was like to be an everyday person at a city during the Middle Bronze Age, which has been an understudied topic. People like to excavate palaces and temples, and very few residential areas have been excavated.  Excavations in the palace revealed monumental architecture, human remains and evidence of destruction, suggesting a significant historical event. The complex, identified through geophysical surveys, is being excavated to establish its characteristics and better understand its function.

(Photo courtesy of Tiffany Earley-Spadoni) In the northwest neighborhoods, exterior courtyards, clay drainpipes, and household refuse were uncovered. Excavated pottery included everyday items such as cups, plates, bowls and storage jars. Some of the pottery was surprisingly well-decorated and carefully made, hinting that private wealth may have been more common than expected, Earley-Spadoni says in her fieldwork summary report. Animal bones found with the pottery suggest that residents enjoyed a varied diet, including domesticated meat and wild game. This level of variety of diet is unexpected for non-elite populations in Mesopotamian cities, based on limited current evidence. These findings may challenge ideas about sharp divisions between elite and non-elite lifestyles in ancient cities. The material culture and dietary practices reflect a community where some people lived relatively well and suggests that further research and analysis is needed to answer lingering questions, Earley-Spadoni says.  We re studying this ancient city to learn very specific things about the ancient inhabitants,  she says.  First, to what degree did they plan their environment, or was it just the result of an organic process? We also want to know how social inequality worked in this ancient city. Were there very poor people and very rich people? Or was there possibly a middle class?  Broken pieces of storage jars marked with a special identifier symbol from the lower town palace. (Photo courtesy of Tiffany-Earley-Spadoni) Encouraging Findings and a Promising Future The city s historical importance could be even greater if it is identified as Qabra, a major regional center referenced in Old Babylonian monuments like the famed Stele of Dadusha, according to Earley-Spadoni. There are many clues that give credence to the theory that Kurd Qaburstan was the prominent city of Qabra that has been referenced in Old Babylonian steles   or ancient monumental slabs. One such clue is that there are ample signs pointing to Kurd Qaburstan serving as a major regional administrative hub, she says.  Kurd Qaburstan is believed to be ancient Qabra, an important regional center mentioned in the records of other city-states,  Earley-Spadoni says.  The presence of writing, monumental architecture, and other administrative artifacts in the lower town palace further supports this identification since the site must have been an important city of its time.  The tablets are still being interpreted but there are some early encouraging findings that help illuminate the greater identity of the people of Kurd Qaburstan and the era they inhabited, she says.  The first of the three tablets was discovered in a trash-filled deposit along with building rubble and human remains,  she says.  Its context suggests dramatic events, possibly evidence of ancient warfare. We hope our work in 2025 will tell us more about this story.  The research and excavation efforts are funded through the U.S. National Science Foundation and in partnership with the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The work occurred from May to July 2024, with previous work conducted from 2013 to 2023 by a team from Johns Hopkins University that included Earley-Spadoni. Tiffany Earley-Spadoni has extensively studied Mesopotamian history and her efforts to excavate the site at Kurd Qaburstan have continued since 2013.

        "title": "Are we at a turning point in world history? | David Motadel",
        "content": "In 1919, at the height of a global crisis that resulted from the turmoil of the Russian Revolution, the devastation of the first world war, and the collapse of Europe s great continental empires, the Irish writer William Butler Yeats penned his famed warning to humanity, mourning the end of the old world:  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.  His words were recently invoked by Joe Biden, addressing the United Nations general assembly. Today, just as then, he warned, the world is facing a critical historical juncture:  I truly believe we are at another inflection point in world history where the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come.  The then president took the opportunity to offer some historical reflections. He recalled the global upheaval of the early 1970s, when he was first elected senator, at the height of the cold war, with wars raging from the Middle East to Vietnam, and a crisis simmering at home:  Back then, we were living through an inflection point, a moment of tension and uncertainty.  Throughout the 20th century, humankind had resolved major watershed crises. Today, with escalating wars from eastern Europe to the Middle East and with deepening divisions in our societies, it was time again, he urged, for concerted action. It was not the first time that Biden had historicized our time as an  inflection point  in world history. It has, in fact, become one of his signature political concepts, invoked in various speeches.  I ve said many times, we are at an inflection point,  he declared in his last foreign policy speech last week.  The post cold-war era is over. A new era has begun.  Many agree. The talk of  inflection points  has been echoed across the global political arena, as world leaders, among them the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, have adopted it to warn about the current geopolitical moment. The world today   marked by the global surge of autocratic powers and anti-democratic forces, the territorial conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Taiwan, the climate crisis, and a new unpredictable industrial revolution fueled by artificial intelligence   appears to be at a historic watershed. It is a moment that historian Adam Tooze dubbed as a  polycrisis . The phenomenon is not new, of course. Throughout history, the world has been rocked by major crises   political turmoil, wars and the downfall of great powers   which appeared earth-shattering at the time. And, routinely, contemporaries have declared them historical  turning points . The most striking of such events in modern history is the French Revolution, which fundamentally challenged the world s old monarchical order.  In two minutes the work of centuries was overturned,  the French revolutionary and writer Louis-S bastien Mercer celebrated in 1789.  Palaces and houses destroyed, churches overturned, their vaults torn asunder.  Even the critics of the revolutionary upheaval did not try to deny its profound historical significance.  The French Revolution is the most astonishing thing that hitherto happened in the world,  the conservative commentator Edmund Burke acknowledged in 1790.  Everything seems out of nature in this strange chaos of levity and ferocity and all sorts of crimes jumbled together.  In his lectures on the philosophy of history, given at the University of Berlin between 1822 and 1831, only a few decades after the storming of the Bastille, GWF Hegel noted that the significance of the French Revolution, with its  external expansion , had been  world historical . The turmoil of the revolutionary era, contemporaries agreed, was a critical historical juncture. Disillusionment followed. The turbulence of 1848 in Europe (and beyond) was also widely considered an inflection point. Revolutionaries across the continent celebrated that it was ushering in a new era of national awakening. Similarly, the years of the first world war were seen by contemporaries as a turning point of humanity. Woodrow Wilson considered it as a struggle that would  make the world safe for democracy ; HG Wells called it  the war to end war . After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Lenin claimed that the time had come for revolutionaries across  all countries and nations throughout the world  to change the course of history. Major mistakes made at that moment, from the ill-fated Versailles treaty to the ill-conceived League of Nations, paved the way for the next catastrophe. The second world war was routinely understood by wartime leaders as an inflection point, the  finest hour , that would be decisive in the triumph of democracy over tyranny. The end of the war, with the creation of the UN, Bretton Woods, Nato, and the European Coal and Steel Community, was hailed as a new era in the west, paving the way to prosperity. Likewise, the fall of the Berlin Wall seemed to spell the  end of history . Francis Fukuyama pondered whether the fundamental transformations of the time, which had engulfed  many regions in the world , would affect  world history . The triumph of liberalism was soon challenged by a global Islamist resurgence, an autocratic China and a revanchist Russia. The attacks of September 11 were seen by many contemporaries as another turning point.  For America, 9/11 was more than a tragedy,  George Bush remarked.  It changed the way we look at the world.  More generally, turning points or inflection points are major events in history that profoundly reshape our lives. One central characteristic of them is their irreversibility, as, afterwards, it seems impossible to return to the status quo ante. Unsurprisingly, political leaders, past and present, have also routinely invoked them, with some urgency, as ways to mobilize support for their cause. This has also allowed them to give their own time (and themselves, as actors or witnesses) historical significance. The major transformations and changes ... in history are always processes which evolve over decades and then become visible through certain events, or turning points Overall, inflection points, past and present, need to be taken seriously. Major moments in history have had irreversible consequences. Yet, we should be cautious not to obsess too much about the events as such. In fact, the fixation on turning points risks overlooking their deeper causes. To understand them, we need to take a sober look at the underlying structural transformations that produce them. In the end,  turning points  are always, at best, merely optical markers on the surface, the  crests of foam that the tides of history carry on their strong backs , as the historian Fernand Braudel put it. The major transformations and changes, the tectonic shifts, in history are always processes which evolve over decades and then become visible through certain events, or turning points. Historians have long studied historical turning points. This has involved questions about the significance or insignificance of certain events. It has also, more importantly, involved criticism of the search for (and the very idea of) turning points, based on the old controversy over the importance of  events  (and sudden changes) versus  structures  (and slow changes over time) in history. Historians have traditionally tended to look at earth-shattering events   wars, crises, revolutions, diplomatic deals   and the deeds of powerful individuals. This research reached its peak in the  great man  history of the 19th-century historicism centered on the German historian Leopold von Ranke. The concentration on great  events  provoked some criticism at the time, voiced by a wide range of scholars, most notably the historian Karl Lamprecht, economist Gustav Schmoller and sociologist Max Weber, who pointed to the importance of deeper social, economic and political transformations in shaping history, and the pitfalls of the idea of turning points. One of the most prominent of the critics was Karl Marx, who in his 1852 essay The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte memorablly declared:  Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past.  The most crushing criticism of the focus on events as turning points in history, however, came from the scholars of the French Annales school, such as Marc Bloch, Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel, who were interested in the deeper material and mental structures below the surface of events. In his 1949 magnum opus The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, Braudel, who coined term  structural history , explored the history of the Mediterranean on three levels: first, the history of the natural environment   geographical and geological conditions   which barely change over time; second, the social, economic and political structures, which slowly evolve, shaped by the natural environment; and third and least importantly, the events caused by human action, shaped by the conditions created by the first two levels. While environmental transformations and changes in social, economic and political structures must be studied over long periods, across generations, centuries, even millennia   the longue dur e   events can be studied within frameworks of days, weeks or years   the courte dur e. Braudel expressed deep mistrust about any fixation on dramatic short-term events   turning points   in conventional history writing. At first sight, he agreed, the past looks like a series of individual events. Yet, great political events and military defeats are actually much less significant on closer look. Sudden historical breaks are almost impossible. A focus on the surface, he warned, obscures the political, economic, social structures that make them possible. Indeed, there are many examples of turning points that turned out to be less momentous when studied as mere expressions of structural transformations. The year 1789 is impossible to understand without taking into account the deeper intellectual transformations, most notably the shifting ideas about society and the state rooted in the Enlightenment, and the profound material changes which led to tensions between nobility, clergy and commoners. Similarly, the moment of 1914 cannot be understood without considering the structures of international affairs, including secret diplomacy, and the rise of nationalism in the long 19th century. The turning point of 1989, likewise, was caused by the deepening economic stagnation of the Soviet Union, generational changes in Eastern Bloc leadership, and global ideological shifts. To understand September 11, we need to be aware of the long history of nativism, Islamism and anti-westernism in the global south. And so on. In all these cases, we need to grasp the underlying conditions if we are to understand the turning points they produced. Histories of great power politics, most notably Paul Kennedy s masterly Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, have long alluded to the deeper natural, economic and military structures that have created war and peace. To be sure, the focus on structures did, in turn, provoke some criticism. Some historians have argued that an idea of history in which individuals are prisoners of structural laws does not leave much room for human agency. Also, we, as humans and readers, prefer narratives involving human agency   stories of heroes and antiheroes   and dramatic events. Looking for (or reading about) deeper structures is far less enjoyable. It is therefore unsurprising that history books on turning points   wars and global crises   continue to rank at the top of our bestseller lists. There are now even books on specific years declared historical turning points by their authors: 1917, 1979 and so on. Some of them do show that the study of turning points can also take into account deeper causes. One of the most striking is Ian Kershaw s Fateful Choices on the inflection points of the second world war, such as Britain s decision to fight Nazi Germany, Hitler s invasion of the Soviet Union and Japan s attack on Pearl Harbor, which carefully addresses the structural conditions and constraints under which wartime leaders operated. Indeed, events and structures are not mutually exclusive. We should, in every case, acknowledge the relevance of both. As historian Reinhart Koselleck once noted:  The processual character of modern history cannot be comprehended other than through the reciprocal explanation of events through structures, and vice versa.  Structural economic, social and political conditions shape events. But on some junctures, events, such a political revolutions or major wars, can profoundly shape structures. The rare occasion when an event gains structural significance constitutes a historical inflection point. Today, world leaders are right to warn that we are facing such a historical inflection point, a global crisis. Yet, to fully understand it, to resolve it, we must not ignore its deeper structural causes, which often reach back to the end of the cold war and beyond. Among them are the resurgence of nationalism, cultural nativism and revanchism, now shaping political cultures around the world; unchecked neoliberal excess and exploitation, creating unsustainable inequalities; and the erosion of a rules-based international order, undermined by both liberal and illiberal powers over the last decades   all fueling wars and dividing societies. Noticing that we are at an inflection point is not enough. To overcome it, we need to tackle these underlying structural problems, which inevitably will be a slow process, not a dramatic deed. History is a long game.",
        "target_summary": "World leaders, including Joe Biden, frequently describe the present global crisis as a historical \"inflection point,\" defining these as major, irreversible events that profoundly reshape societies. While many past eras were also perceived as turning points, historians caution that such events are often surface manifestations of deeper, slow-moving structural transformations rather than standalone breaks. Ultimately, true historical inflection points occur when an event gains structural significance, and resolving contemporary crises requires understanding and addressing their underlying, long-term structural causes.",

        "title": "Nuremberg Trials",
        "content": "Defendants, Nuremberg Trials US Army (Public Domain) The Nuremberg trials (1945-6), held in N rnberg (Nuremberg), Germany, were a series of trials involving the senior surviving Nazis to hold them accountable for waging war and committing war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Second World War (1939-45). 22 Nazis were tried, with 19 found guilty and sentenced to either death by hanging or lengthy prison terms. The first Nuremberg trials were conducted from November 1945 to October 1946, and then, a second phase, which involved a much larger number of defendants, was conducted from November 1946 to April 1949. The Nuremberg trials were the first in history where the victors in a war sought to make senior figures from the losing side accountable for their actions. The trials were filmed and contributed greatly to our understanding of how WWII was conducted and revealed both the irrefutable evidence for and enormous scale of such atrocities as the Holocaust. The first month of the trials, the initial proceedings only, were hosted in the Supreme Court Building in Berlin, but they moved on 20 November to the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg. The Palace of Justice was selected because it had been the heart of Nazi show trials against enemies of the Third Reich, the city was the home of the Nuremberg Rally, the infamous annual Nazi Party congress, and the complex had the practical advantage of an adjoining prison where the defendants were detained. Remove Ads  The International Military Tribunal At the close of WWII, the victorious Allies of France, Britain, the United States, and the USSR, as agreed by their respective leaders at a conference in Moscow back in October 1943, jointly formed an International Military Tribunal (IMT) to bring German Nazi war criminals to justice. There were some calls to have judges from neutral nations head the IMT, but the allied leaders were determined to be directly involved in getting their pound of flesh. The idea of the trials was supported by a number of other nations besides the four main powers. The legacy of the Nuremberg trials included raising awareness of the victims of Nazism & establishing a legal framework to prosecute war criminals. The panel that would decide the fate of the defendants brought before the IMT consisted of one judge and one prosecutor from each of the four nations mentioned above. The judging panel was presided over by the British judge Lord Justice Geoffrey Lawrence, described by one American lawyer as \"like God...Hollywood would have cast him\" (MacDonald, 23). The chief Soviet judge was I. T. Nikitchenko, the French lead judge was Henri Donnedieu de Vabres, and the US judge was Francis B. Biddle. The legal proceedings followed the common law practice applied in the United States and Britain. Translators worked in the courtroom, and everyone present had access to a set of headphones. There was a large screen to show the court relevant film clips and statistical information. 250 journalists attended the court sessions, and the whole proceedings were filmed and sound recorded. Remove Ads  Nuremberg Trials Judges U.S. Army (CC BY-NC-SA) In the closing stages of the war, Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), Joseph Goebbels (1897-1945), and Heinrich Himmler (1900-1945) had all committed suicide, but there remained 24 senior Nazi figures whom the Allies were determined to bring to justice. The group was selected not only for their individual roles but also as representatives of particular Nazi institutions. Before the trials could begin, Robert Ley (1890-1945), head of the German Labour Front, committed suicide, and Gustav Krupp (1870-1950), an industrialist who had used forced labour, was considered too physically frail to stand trial. The 22 remaining defendants faced four charges, as expressed in the Oxford Companion to World War II, they were: Count 1: Contributing to a common plan or conspiracy to wage war Contributing to a common plan or conspiracy to wage war Count 2: Crimes against peace Crimes against peace Count 3: War crimes (e.g. violations of the Geneva Convention such as the abuse and murder of prisoners of war, use of prisoners for labour, destruction of private property, and devastation of property and places with no military justification) War crimes (e.g. violations of the Geneva Convention such as the abuse and murder of prisoners of war, use of prisoners for labour, destruction of private property, and devastation of property and places with no military justification) Count 4: Crimes against humanity (e.g. the murder of civilian populations, use of slave labour, the forced deportation of civilians, and the persecution of specific social, political, religious, and racial groups) Counts 1 and 2 proved problematic to define, and therefore it was difficult to find the defendants either innocent or guilty of them. This is hardly surprising considering the debate amongst historians ever since as to why and how WWII started and how far one should go back exactly in order to discover the causes of WWII, causes which could be attributed in some cases to both the victors and losers. The court essentially considered counts 1 and 2 as involving actions such as breaking international treaties and invading and occupying free countries. Much easier to establish were cases of counts 3 and 4, although even here there was the added complication that the victors had themselves been guilty of what would today be called war crimes, for example, the Allied bombing of Germany, submarine attacks on unarmed vessels, and the Katyn Forest massacre of Polish prisoners of war by USSR forces. Certain facts were taken as given, such as that Hitler had fully intended to start a world war. In addition, such Nazi organisations as the Gestapo (secret police), the SS (Schutzstaffel), and SA (Sturmabteilung) were condemned as criminal organisations. Remove Ads  Palace of Justice, Nuremberg US Army (Public Domain) The judges not only benefitted from the cross-examination of the defendants but also the testimony of around 360 witnesses (including both victims of and members of the Nazi regime) and a huge quantity of incriminating documents, official and otherwise, including indisputable photographs, sound recordings, and films, such as those taken at concentration and death camps. As noted by Dr Robert Kempner, a lawyer who had fled the Nazi regime: One of the biggest helps to us was the German bureaucratic sense   they kept everything and they even made publications and films and lot of material had been discovered by our Allied search teams. Some of the people like General Governor Frank of Poland was so anxious to show his friend Hitler after the war what he has done that he kept diaries, volumes and volumes and volumes. In fact he had written his own indictment. (Holmes, 593) It is important to note, however, that the documentation for Nuremberg was compiled in order to support the legal case that the defendants were guilty of one or more of the four counts (and not to create a comprehensive reconstruction of past events as, say, a historian would do). There was, too, a degree of negotiation between the various national judges regarding particular defendants   the USSR judge, for example, wanted Rudolf Hess hanged while his fellow judges preferred a prison sentence   but there was a conscious effort on all parties to deliberate with as much fairness as possible given the seriousness of the trials and the world's scrutiny of them. To this end, the defendants were collectively represented by a legal counsel, Otto Kranzenb hler, and permitted individual lawyers to present their defence.

G ring was by far the most charismatic of those on trial, and he eloquently justified his past actions, although, in the process, he did no more than reveal his total lack of conscience for the gravity of them. According to Speer, G ring told him he was convinced the \"victors would undoubtedly kill him but that within fifty years his remains would be laid in a marble sarcophagus and he would be celebrated by the German people as a national hero and martyr\" (Speer, 681). Those who had belonged to the army or navy remained adamant that they should not be on trial at all since they were obeying military orders. Similarly, the civilians believed their actions, no matter how despicable, had been covered by the oath of loyalty they had once been obliged to swear to Hitler. Others pointed out that those in government should not be judged by standards usually applied to private individuals. Another argument of defence was that the victors had no legal right to put the losers on trial in the first place. Some, like Rosenberg and Streicher, were, in any case, completely unrepentant of their past actions. Dr Franz Blaha Giving Evidence at Nuremberg Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The simplistic, brutal thinking, or rather lack of thinking, of SS men like Kaltenbrunner and Frank was self-evident. Frick refused to testify at all during his trial. Speer cleverly tried to distance himself from his simpler and more notorious colleagues, constructing for himself a case that suggested he had merely been sucked into Nazism by Hitler's powerful personality. Indeed, Speer was one of the few to accept his guilt (although he is now known to have lied about his lack of knowledge of the Holocaust), or at least accept his part in what he described as a \"collective responsibility\" (Dear, 808) for the war and its consequences. Finally, Hess seemed on the fringes of lunacy, although he was not clinically diagnosed as insane. Hess annoyed G ring, his immediate neighbour in the dock, with his constant fidgeting and odd bursts of laughter. All in all, the 22 men looked rather pathetic in their civilian suits. Speer noted the effect of the absence of costume: \"For years I had been accustomed to seeing all these defendants in magnificent uniforms, either unapproachable or jovially expansive. The whole scene now seemed unreal; sometimes I imagined I was dreaming\" (678). The public and press were also surprised by how ordinary these arch-criminals looked. The novelist Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966) noted that only Kaltenbrunner looked anything like a criminal. Remove Ads  Each defendant was tried in turn, and even those who were cockiest at the beginning, such as G ring, were effectively silenced by the overwhelming mass of evidence against them. Indeed, the evidence was often so horrific and so repetitive that some journalists questioned the necessity of presenting it in such a methodical manner. Ultimately, through the course of the trial, the majority of the defendants themselves realised, if they had not done so already, that they had no defence against the charges brought before them. Final Sentences The defendants finally heard their fate on 1 October 1946. G ring committed suicide by swallowing a potassium cyanide pill a few hours before he was to be hanged. G ring's body was cremated, and his ashes were thrown in the ordinary rubbish. Those others who had been sentenced to death were hanged two weeks later on 16 October in the prison at Nuremberg. As a soldier, Keitel asked to be shot, but his request was denied. The bodies of the hanged men were cremated, and their ashes were scattered on the estuary of the Isar River. Those given prison terms at Spandau Prison in Berlin served various lengths of those terms, depending on their health. The last prisoner was Rudolph Hess, who committed suicide at the age of 93. Corpse of Joachim von Ribbentrop US Army (Public Domain) Subsequent Proceedings From November 1946 to April 1949, a further 185 Nazi war criminals faced trials organised by the United States military. These trials, conducted alone by the US authorities, are known as the US Nuremberg Military Tribunals. The majority of the defendants faced charges related to the inhuman treatment of, medical experimentation upon, and murder of civilians in Nazi concentration camps and the exploitation of civilians as labourers in industry. Of these defendants, 131 were found guilty, with 24 receiving the death sentence and the rest given prison terms. There were other post-WWII trials of war criminals, notably the Far East war crime trials, which dealt with Japanese war criminals, and trials in specific countries, particularly in Poland and the USSR. Germany conducted several denazification trials. There were also some reversals of earlier verdicts. Schacht was sentenced to eight years of hard labour (but only served two), while Alfred Jodl was exonerated by a German denazification court in 1953. By 1949, \"the Allies had convicted 5,025 people\" (Hite, 341). Many Nazi war criminals escaped capture, but the search for them went on, and some were ultimately brought to justice, often decades later. Such a figure, one of the chief administrators of the Holocaust, was Adolf Eichmann (1906-1962), apprehended in Argentina in 1960, tried in Israel, and then hanged. The legacy of the Nuremberg trials and those which followed included raising awareness of the victims of Nazism and establishing a framework on which international laws could be agreed upon. These laws could be used to hold leaders responsible for their actions and act as a deterrent to war crimes being committed. The Nuremberg trials provided a precedent, for example, for the trial of war criminals following the conflicts in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.",

        "title": "War of Jenkins' Ear: How One Man's Ear Started a Colonial War Between Empires",
        "content": "Battle of Cartagena de Indias, 1741 Unknown Artist (Copyright) The War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748) was a colonial conflict fought between Great Britain and Spain, primarily in the Caribbean and off the coast of South America. Looking to protect its interests in the West Indies, Britain provoked a war with Spain, one of its biggest colonial rivals, citing the mistreatment of one Captain Robert Jenkins, who was detained   and allegedly mutilated   by Spanish coast guards as they searched his ship for smuggled goods. In 1739, British Vice Admiral Edward Vernon sailed a fleet into the Caribbean, where he won some victories before his eventual defeat at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1741. After that climactic battle, the war fizzled out as the British soon had their hands full with other conflicts, such as the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748) in Europe and King George's War (1744-1748) in North America. Background Since the conclusion of Queen Anne's War (1702-1713), the European colonial powers in North America had enjoyed a relative period of peace. This was largely the work of Sir Robert Walpole, the leading British politician of the day, who became prime minister in 1721. Walpole and his Whig government believed that the British Empire would profit more from avoiding wars, both on the continent and overseas. Without the burdensome cost of military upkeep, Walpole was able to lower taxes while simultaneously working to pay off the national debt, with a sinking fund. Though many celebrated this pacifist policy, it was opposed by the Tories in Parliament, who feared that a non-combative Britain would soon fall behind its rivals, particularly in the Americas. The French, for example, were steadily expanding their influence in the West Indies, growing rich off their sugar plantations there. Should French meddling in the region go unopposed, then France would surely dominate the lucrative West Indies trade, at the expense of Britain's imperial interests. For these reasons, the Tories demanded a show of military force before it was too late. Remove Ads  Spain's overseas empire was not as powerful as it once was & was viewed by the British as bloated, decadent, & ripe for the taking. But even the hawkish Tories were aware that a direct war with France could lead to a long and costly struggle. Instead, they decided to assert their influence in the West Indies by picking on another target they deemed to be weaker: Spain. For centuries, the Spanish had dominated commerce in the West Indies with a trade network connected by four major ports: Veracruz, Portobelo, Cartagena de Indias, and Havana. But Spain's overseas empire was not as powerful as it once was and was viewed by the British as bloated, decadent, and ripe for the taking. Britain's hostility towards Spain was also fueled by an anti-Catholic, anti-Spanish stereotype called the 'Black Legend', in which Spaniards were painted as cruel and greedy brutes. For these reasons, the Tories clamored for a war with Spain, both to assert British dominance in the West Indies and to send a message to France by beating up its weaker ally. The Spanish, for their part, were not blind to Britain's expansionist desires and spent the period of peace watching the other colonial power with unease. Their suspicions seemed confirmed when, in 1732, the British founded a new colony, Georgia, right on the doorstep of Spanish Florida, increasing tensions on the mainland as well. Amidst all these rising tensions, Britain and Spain continued to trade in the West Indies. However, Spanish ports often imposed high tariffs on their goods, leading to an increase in smuggling. British smugglers would load up on Caribbean goods, particularly sugar, and take them to the Thirteen Colonies, where these luxuries were always in high demand. To crack down on such practices, the Spanish coast guard often patrolled the Caribbean Sea, stopping and searching any British vessel suspected of carrying contraband. Remove Ads  Map of Spanish Main & West Indies c.1720 Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) On 9 April 1731, a Spanish coast guard ship stopped one such vessel, the Rebecca, which had taken on quantities of sugar in Jamaica and was now bound for London. As the Spanish sailors searched the Rebecca, they detained its crew, including the captain, Robert Jenkins. Jenkins, according to his own disposition and some other accounts, was tied to the ship's mast with a rope around his neck and was hoisted into the air three times. The Spanish captain then sliced Jenkins's left ear with his cutlass, which was then torn off by another Spanish sailor. After threatening to treat King George II of Great Britain (reign 1727-1760) in the same manner, the Spaniards then left the Rebecca, returned to their own ship, and sailed off. The Rebecca continued on to London, where the one-eared Jenkins proceeded to tell his story to all who would listen. The story made some traction and was reported in several newspapers   including the Pennsylvania Gazette, edited by an up-and-coming Benjamin Franklin   but the scandal did not fully break until 1738. That year, Jenkins was granted an audience with the Privy Council and even appeared before King George II himself. According to one   likely apocryphal   version of events, Jenkins presented the king with his severed ear pickled in a jar as proof of his sorrowful mistreatment. Jenkins' tale outraged the British public, seeming to confirm their 'Black Legend' prejudices regarding Spanish cruelty. The Tories gained ground in Parliament, politicizing the incident to paint Walpole's Whig government as weak. In March 1739, Parliament passed a vote formally asking the king to seek redress from Spain, on behalf of both Jenkins and other British merchants who claimed to have been similarly mistreated. After Spain refused Britain's demands for restitution, George II declared war on 15 June 1739, an act that was ratified by Parliament four months later. Remove Ads  Vernon Arrives in the West Indies Shortly after the declaration of war, on 20 July 1739, British Vice Admiral Edward Vernon set sail for the West Indies with a fleet of Royal Navy warships. He arrived at Antigua in early October and immediately set about disrupting Spanish trade in the region. At the end of the month, he dispatched three ships under Captain Thomas Waterhouse to attack the Spanish port of La Guira in present-day Venezuela and to burn all the Spanish ships in the harbor. Aware that he could not simply blast his way into the port, Waterhouse decided to use deception to gain entry and ordered his vessels to hoist the Spanish flag. The Spaniards, however, had long been expecting an attack and were not fooled by the ruse. As soon as Waterhouse's three ships came within range of their port guns, the Spanish opened fire. The British ships took heavy damage and were forced to withdraw, limping back to Jamaica for repairs. Despite this setback, Vernon was undeterred. On 20 November, he sailed to Portobelo (in present-day Panama) with six ships of the line and captured it in under 24 hours. The British occupied Portobelo for three weeks, destroying its fortifications and seizing the two 20-gun coast guard ships in its harbor as prizes. Capture of Portobelo Samuel Scott (Public Domain) The victory at Portobelo was lauded across the British Empire; the capture of a major Spanish port was seen as a great success. Vernon was promoted to admiral, and the Walpole government was pressured into providing additional resources for the war effort. In the spring of 1740, Vernon looked to keep the momentum going by attacking another of the major Spanish ports, Cartagena de Indias, in present-day Colombia. Cartagena, if captured, would be an even more impressive prize than Portobelo. The city itself was heavily fortified and home to over 10,000 people. Its harbor, considered by some observers to be among the finest in the world, was where the Spanish galleons came to take on great quantities of gold and silver from the mines of Peru. Its capture, therefore, would greatly weaken Spain's hold on the West Indies trade. On 13 March 1740, Vernon arrived outside Cartagena with several ships of the line, 3 bomb vessels, 2 fire ships, and multiple transports carrying infantry. After spending a few days reconnoitering the position of the nearest Spanish fleet, Vernon ordered his bomb ships to begin bombarding the city. The Spanish, who had set up a temporary shore battery, returned fire and were able to prevent transport vessels carrying 400 British soldiers from landing. Vernon, finding the city's defenses stronger than anticipated, soon withdrew. His plans frustrated by the guns of Cartagena, Vernon sought to regain his mojo with another easy victory. On 22 March, he attacked the fortress of San Lorenzo on the Chagres River in Panama. His bomb ships pounded the fortress into submission, and the British admiral accepted the Spanish commander's surrender two days later. Like they had done at Portobelo, the British spent the next few weeks destroying San Lorenzo's fortifications and seizing guns, boats, and anything else of military value. Emboldened by this success, Vernon returned to Cartagena de Indias on 3 May, only to find that the Spanish had not been idle in his absence. A new viceroy, Sebasti n de Eslava y Lazaga, had arrived from Spain along with hundreds of seasoned reinforcements, boosting the port city's garrison to somewhere between 3 to 4,000 men (the defenders included 600 Indigenous archers). Having anticipated Vernon's coming, the Spanish arrayed six of their own ships of the line in the harbor to oppose him. This unexpected readiness gave Vernon pause. Rather than roll the dice on a battle and risk throwing away his earlier gains, he decided to once again withdraw to more thoroughly prepare for an attack. He would spend the next half year building an expedition force, one of the largest that a European power had yet deployed in the Americas. Remove Ads  Battle of Cartagena de Indias As many as 18,000 men died during the 67 days Vernon spent outside Cartagena's walls, most of them from disease. By the end of the year, Vernon had organized a military expedition worthy of Cartagena de Indias' strong defenses. He had put together a fleet of 124 ships, including 29 ships of the line, 22 frigates, several bomb ships, fire ships, and hospital ships, and over 80 transport vessels. The army component of the expedition consisted of 12,000 men, including two regiments of British regular infantry as well as 6,000 royal marines. This number also included four battalions of colonial troops   3,600 men in total   who had been raised in the Thirteen Colonies. Under the competent leadership of Governor Alexander Spotswood of Virginia, these colonial soldiers were set to rendezvous with Vernon's fleet in Jamaica before the entire force completed its journey to Cartagena. But no sooner had Vernon laid out his grand plans than dire complications arose. In June 1740, Governor Spotswood died in Annapolis, depriving the colonial battalions of their leader. Six months later, Lord Cathcart, who had been slotted to serve as commander-in-chief of the expedition's land forces, also fell ill and died while crossing the Atlantic from London. To make matters worse, as the expedition gathered in Jamaica, the ships' crews and the soldiers aboard the transports began to suffer from diseases like scurvy, typhus, and dysentery. By January 1741, sickness had already killed 500 men and incapacitated 1,500 more. After forcing 300 enslaved Africans into service to replace his dead sailors, Vernon raised anchor, and his formidable fleet set sail for Cartagena de Indias. The Spaniards, meanwhile, were readying themselves to meet this threat. In charge of the city's defense was Admiral Blas de Lezo, a man who was already a veritable legend on the high seas; having lost an arm, a leg, and an eye in previous battles, he was known as Patapalo, or 'Pegleg', and Mediohombre, or 'Half-man' (at least, he was referred to as such in later sources; there is scant evidence he was known by these nicknames in his own lifetime). Aware that he was heavily outnumbered, de Lezo hoped to hold out long enough to wear the British down through attrition, betting that, unused to the tropical diseases, their numbers would quickly dwindle. On 13 March 1741, the British expedition arrived outside Cartagena. With Lord Cathcart dead, there was no central army commander, and Vernon often found himself bickering with the army officers. Still, the British commanders agreed that any attack from the ocean would be impossible, as Cartagena's walls were too strong. Instead, they would have to gain entry through a narrow, deep-water channel called Boca Chica and assault the city's outer defenses from there. This channel, however, was well-defended by two bastions: Fort San Jose on one side and Fort San Luis on the other. Blas de Lezo Unknown Artist (CC BY) For the next several weeks, Vernon directed all his firepower on Fort San Luis. Eventually, the British made a breach in its walls and landed their infantry and royal marines in preparation for an assault. On 5 April, the British attacked Fort San Luis by both land and sea. But when the British regulars poured in through the breach, they found the Spanish defenders gone; de Lezo had pulled his men back to the inner fortification of Castillo San Felipe de Barajas the previous night. Though the British had seized control of the city's outer fortifications, it had taken them a month to do so   with more men falling sick and dying every day, they were running out of time. In his desperation to conclude the siege, Vernon drew up a plan for a risky frontal assault on Castillo San Felipe. In the early morning hours of 20 April, 2,000 British and colonial soldiers under Colonel John Grant attempted to storm the fort with ladders. They ran right into the waiting muskets of 1,000 Spanish soldiers, who de Lezo had entrenched below the walls of the fort proper. Repeated volleys of the Spanish muskets stopped the British assault in its tracks, a situation made worse when Cartagena's cannons began to open fire. Once the British began to waver, the Spanish leapt from their trenches and drove them back with a spirited bayonet charge. Remove Ads  By the time the battle was over, the British had lost 600 men, including Colonel Grant, who was killed. Vernon saw the writing on the wall and realized he had neither the time nor the men for another attack. On 9 May, he lifted the siege and returned to Jamaica. As many as 18,000 of his men died during the 67 days he spent outside Cartagena's walls, most of them from disease. The Spanish lost less than 2,000. Of the colonial troops who had served under Vernon, barely 300 survived to return to the Thirteen Colonies. One of these was Lawrence Washington, the elder half-brother of George Washington, future first president of the United States. Lawrence had been sufficiently impressed with his commanding admiral to name his property in Virginia 'Mount Vernon' in his honor. Vernon himself had reached the zenith of his military career. After lackluster success in 1742, he was recalled to Britain. The Walpole government, too, could not survive the disaster of the Cartagena expedition, and Walpole resigned as prime minister in 1742. Thus, the Spanish victory at Cartagena marked the most important moment of the war, not only thwarting Britain's expansionist ambitions but also shaking up its government. Edward Vernon Thomas Gainsborough (Public Domain) War in Florida & Georgia As Vernon was grappling with the Spaniards in the West Indies, warfare also broke out in North America, between the British colony of Georgia and Spanish Florida. Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1739, Major General James Oglethorpe, the founder of Georgia, was instructed by King George II to  annoy the subjects of Spain in the best manner  (quoted by APUSH). Heeding this royal decree, Oglethorpe led 200 men into Florida in December, seizing forts Picolata and San Francisco de Pupo, both situated west of St. Augustine. In May 1740, Oglethorpe returned to Florida with 1,200 men, including Georgia militia and Indigenous allies from the Creek, Chickasaw, and Uchee nations. They laid siege to St. Augustine itself, but due to logistical difficulties, they were forced to lift the siege in July. Oglethorpe returned to Georgia, where he built a fort on the Frederica River in preparation for the inevitable Spanish counterattack. Such an attack would manifest in the spring of 1742 when Manuel de Montiano, governor of Florida, led 4,000 men into Georgia. On 18 July 1742, the Spanish were advancing along the road to Fort Frederica when they encountered a contingent of Georgia rangers and Native American warriors. Taken by surprise, the Spanish were soon driven back. Oglethorpe took advantage of this small victory by leading the rest of his men out of the fort in pursuit of the retreating Spanish. That same day, he caught up with them, and the two forces clashed at the Battle of Bloody Marsh. Familiar with the terrain, Oglethorpe's Georgia militia and Native American warriors took cover in the dense vegetation, giving them clear shots at the Spanish troops who remained out in the open. When his men started running low on ammunition, Montiano ordered a retreat and ultimately withdrew back into Florida. In March 1743, Oglethorpe led yet another raid into Florida with the goal of capturing St. Augustine. However, he once again met with failure and retreated back into Georgia. This marked the end of the fighting along the Georgia-Florida border for the remainder of the war. End of War By and large, Vernon's failed assault on Cartagena de Indias marked the end of the war. Shortly after that, the War of Jenkins' Ear   as the conflict would come to be called   would be overshadowed by other wars breaking out all over the world. In Europe, Britain had been drawn into the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740, and in 1744, it would face off with France in North America in King George's War. Though Britain and Spain remained at war, the subsequent battles were more associated with these other conflicts, except for minor privateer actions in the West Indies. It was not until 1748 that the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended all these wars. The treaty stipulated that the situation in the West Indies return to the way it had been before the war, and that British smuggling in the region cease. Thus, the War of Jenkins' Ear was effectively a Spanish victory.",
        "target_summary": "The War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748) was a colonial conflict between Great Britain and Spain, provoked by Britain over the alleged mistreatment of Captain Robert Jenkins and a desire to assert dominance in the West Indies. British Vice Admiral Edward Vernon initially won victories but suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1741, losing thousands of men mostly to disease. Following this major setback, the war largely subsided as Britain focused on other conflicts, concluding in 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which effectively resulted in a Spanish victory.",

        "title": "Florentine Codex: An Encyclopedia of Life in 16th-Century Mexico",
        "content": "Florentine Codex Bernardino de Sahag n (CC BY-NC-ND) The Florentine Codex is an encyclopedic accounting of life in 16th-century Mexico and an invaluable resource for understanding the exchange between European and Indigenous cultures during the Spanish conquest. Emerging from a time of societal upheaval, the codex was written as an attempt to record the culture and beliefs of the Aztec peoples of Mexico in the areas surrounding the once great city of Tenochtitlan. The work covers a broad array of topics, including religion, everyday life, native flora and fauna, and Indigenous perspectives on the conquest itself. Written at a time when Spanish authorities had been and still were actively undermining Aztec culture and beliefs, the Florentine Codex represents an attempt to document and preserve a past and people being systematically censored. It is the product of many minds in collaboration, written in two different languages by numerous scribes and illuminated by a number of artists employing a uniquely syncretic style of illustration, all of which comes together to create a multifaceted depiction of the culture, language, and history of Aztec civilization immediately following the fall of the empire. Remove Ads  Contents The Florentine Codex was completed sometime between the fall of 1575 and the spring of 1577 after nearly 30 years in the making. Composed of 12 illuminated books with a total of 2,446 pages and 2,472 illustrations, it is widely attributed to a Franciscan friar known as Fray Bernardino de Sahag n (1499-1590). Though the modern title of the codex comes from the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, where it is housed today, scholars do not know what the original title was at the time of its completion. Sahag n himself referred to the text variously in his native Spanish as doze libros ( \"twelve books\"), obra (\"work\"), and, perhaps most expansively, Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva Espa a (\"General History of the Things of New Spain\"). While the codex certainly contains history, its scope is greater than even that title might suggest. The contents of the Florentine Codex are summarized below: Book 1: Prologue and the Gods Book 2: Ceremonies of the Aztec Calendar Book 3: Origin of the Gods and Mythology Book 4: Astrology and Divinatory Practices Book 5: Omens Book 6: Rhetoric and Moral Philosophy Book 7: Natural Philosophy and Celestial Phenomena (Sun, Moon, and Stars) Book 8: Lords of Tenochtitlan, Tlaltelolco, Tetzcoco, and Huexotla, Education and Customs of These Lords Book 9: Merchants, Craftsmen, and Artisans Book 10: The People, Occupations, and Anatomy Book 11: Earthly Things, Natural History Book 12: Conquest of Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco from the Indigenous Perspective The folios of this impressive work include text in two languages: Spanish, the language of the intended audience of the codex, and Nahuatl, the language of the Indigenous peoples of Mexico. While the text is bilingual, neither language represents a translation of the other. Instead, the texts exist in parallel, the Spanish frequently interpreting, abbreviating, adding to, or omitting information from the content of the Indigenous language. For this reason, modern scholars have stressed the need to read the two texts in conjunction rather than one on behalf of the other: Though the entries can be read side by side, their meanings are not always in harmony. There is an ebb and flow in the presence of the Spanish and Nahuatl texts; sometimes there is less written in one language than the other, sometimes one is absent from a folio altogether, and even when they are both present, readers might find inconsistencies in their tone, meaning, or content. Remove Ads  The images in the Florentine Codex integrate artistic elements from native traditions with the conventions of European traditional styles. Alongside the two languages, the Florentine Codex is punctuated with illustrations. The images in the codex include both decorations and compositions; many are painted in vivid color, while others are rendered only in ink outline, but all of them were illustrated by native artists over the course of years. In the 16th century, images were efficient and impactful ways of conveying information across linguistic and ideological barriers and became a common means of communicating messages in the early colonial world. Painted cloths, wall art, prints, banners, and other means of pictorial expression became tools for religious, political, and social communication, especially in the early days when only a few individuals could translate between Nahuatl and Spanish, much less the other languages spoken in Mesoamerica at the time. The images in the Florentine Codex represent an entirely separate mode of communication, and one with which both cultures would have been intimately familiar, though in different ways. In the Nahuatl language, Indigenous painter-writers were known as tlacuiloque (singular tlacuilo), and were heirs to an artistic tradition that stretched back centuries before the European colonization of the Americas. Created by such skilled artisans, the images in the Florentine Codex are stylistic adaptations, integrating artistic elements from native traditions with the format and conventions of the European traditional styles, particularly the convention that favored formal isolation of subjects within the layout of the page. While the presentation of the images is generally more European in style, there are several examples of Aztec artistic conventions in the Florentine Codex. These include the use of curling symbols called \"speech scrolls\" to indicate a speaking individual in a static image, and the practice of depicting seashells on the edges of tendrils of water. Both of these stylistic elements appear in the image of Chalchiuhtlicue from the Codex Borbonicus, which was created by Aztec priests and preserves many pre-Hispanic modes of pictorial representation. Remove Ads  Chalchiuhtlicue Unknown Artist (Public Domain) While the texts address audiences in the languages of two cultures, the images of the Florentine Codex represent the clearest examples of the cultural syncretism at play in 16th-century Mexico: Such a work could have been produced only in Mesoamerica, where the introduction of the Roman alphabet and European art style made sense to people who had been writing and painting with ink and natural colors for centuries. It is among the rare first manuscripts to represent indigenous cultures that involved indigenous people. (Peterson & Terraciano, 13) Sahag n's Collaborators While Fray Bernardino de Sahag n is considered the author of the Florentine Codex, it was actually a product of a substantial collaborative effort and featured the contributions of people from Mexico's Indigenous communities as its primary content. That being said, the codex would have been impossible without Sahag n, whose role included writing, coordinating, editing, and translating, in addition to proposing the actual idea of and advocating for the project itself. Considering the extensive subject matter and sheer volume of scribal and artistic labor involved, one man, even one as ambitious as Sahag n, could not have accomplished the ambition of this project alone. Sahag n was a teacher and missionary absolutely dedicated to the conversion of the native people of Mexico to Catholic Christianity. He believed that in order to accomplish his goal, he had to understand the belief systems, culture, and language that had preceded the colonial influence of Spain. After all, missionaries could not ideologically eclipse a religion they could not recognize and could not convey Christianity without sharing a common language with their prospective converts. But Sahag n and his peers in the church had come to Mexico after the conquest and had little to no knowledge of Aztec civilization. In order to accomplish his ultimate evangelical aim, Sahag n had to rely on information from those he sought to convert. Remove Ads  Aztec Musicians Madman2001 (Public Domain) Beyond just content, Sahag n needed help with the recording process. The nearly 2,500-page Florentine Codex was drafted multiple times over the course of three decades through the concerted efforts of a number of steady-handed and literate men. These men were intellectuals, born in Mexico to Indigenous parents and then educated at colleges  and staffed by the Spanish church. They, like Sahag n himself, were fluent in Nahuatl, Spanish, and Latin, and were instrumental in the creation of the codex, a process that occurred largely in the later years of Sahag n's life, when age rendered the friar incapable of writing anything himself with his own trembling hands. Though he was certainly the author of the prologues and parts of the Spanish text, those sections represent less than half of the content of the Florentine Codex. Creating the Codex From 1559 to 1565, Sahag n and his collaborators collected what would become the Florentine Codex in conversation with elders in the settlements of Tepepulco and Tlatelolco. During his time in Tepepulco, Sahag n worked with local authorities to assemble a group of approximately twelve elders. These elders had all lived through the cataclysmic arrival of Hern n Cort s and his forces and could offer their knowledge of the pre-Hispanic Aztec culture to Sahag n's project. After the friar and his team of scribal scholars recorded their spoken testimony, the elders offered images representing what they had said. As mentioned above, Aztec tlacuiloque had kept history and culture in pictorial records long before the advent of the Roman alphabet in Mexico. After three years in Tepepulco, Sahag n and his nascent codex were transferred to Tlatelolco, where he once again presented his intentions and requested leaders from among the native peoples. With about ten more elders, all of whom were capable and knowledgeable in Nahuatl and the preconquest customs of the Aztecs, Sahag n and his team proceeded to expand on, clarify, and revise the work. Remove Ads  Map of the Aztec Empire, c. 1427 1521 Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) When the friar concluded his interviews in Tlatelolco around 1565, his collaboration had produced what is known today as the C dices Matritenses or Madrid Codices, an early draft of the Florentine Codex. Like its later iteration, the Madrid Codices are written in Spanish and Nahuatl, but unlike the Florentine Codex, the 1565 draft is not illustrated and includes three columns of text. The left columns, written in Spanish, encompass Sahag n's notes on the same subjects addressed in the central columns, all of which were written in Nahuatl on specific topics. The columns furthest to the right, which do not appear in the Florentine Codex, articulated Sahag n's lexical notes on the Nahuatl language. The friar had planned to include the third column in the Florentine Codex as well, but a lack of time and support, in Sahag n's own estimation, prevented his culminating work from being the linguistic resource he had intended it to be. At this point, Sahag n describes editing, dividing the content into twelve books and sorting the text into specific chapters and paragraphs. He writes: The Mexicans corrected and added many things to the twelve books as they were being copied anew, in such a way that the first sieve through which my works were strained was that of Tepepulco; the second, that of Tlatelolco; the third, that of Mexico. (Book 2, folios 1v-2r, translated by Garc a Garagarza) Among the hands and minds that sieved his works, the friar mentions a few by name. Though it does not represent a complete list of his Indigenous collaborators, Sahag n mentions Mart n Jacobita, who was director of the colegio of Tlatelolco, Antonio Valeriano, who was a native of Azcapotzalco, and two natives of Cuauhtitlan named Alonso Vegerano and Pedro de San Buenaventura, all of whom were experts in Latin, Spanish, and Nahuatl. In his list of scribes, he includes Diego de Grado and Bonifacio Maximiliano, both natives of Tlatelolco, and Mateo Severino from Xochimilco. Peterson and Terraciano assert that there were many other unnamed collaborators from the communities surrounding Lake Texcoco that contributed to the final product. Sahag n ultimately delivered a book containing far more than was necessary to convert the native population to Christianity. He created a vehicle through which Nahuatl authors and artists of the 16th century can still be heard and seen today. Aztec Agriculture Peter Isotalo (Public Domain) Sahag n's Goals In his prologue to Book 1, Sahag n articulates multiple aims for the practical use of the Florentine Codex. The first of his goals naturally centers on his role in converting the native population. Likening the work of missionaries to physicians tasked with diagnosing and treating illnesses, he claims that as physicians care for the body, priests and confessors are meant to minister to the souls of those whom they aim to convert to Christianity. In order to accomplish that task, he asserts that it was necessary to record accurate accounts of the language and beliefs of the Indigenous peoples of Mexico before the Spanish conquest. These linguistic and anthropological endeavors become the other stated goals of the codex. Sahag n makes it clear that one of his goals is to demonstrate the worth of the peoples who had suffered devastation at the hands of Cort s. The presence of so much Nahuatl language in the codex represents the scope of Sahag n's dedication to this goal. By 1540, well before initiating the project that would become the Florentine Codex, he had already authored a number of sermons in Nahuatl, enough to be delivered at all of the saints' days and Sundays of the year. He had tailored these to the Indigenous people, both the nobility and the lower classes, not just in their language but according to the aptitude he recognized in them at the time. As he learned more, the friar would find that their capacity not only exceeded his expectations but evoked in him a profound respect for their way of life, which would inform and enhance his convictions in his anthropological aim. While it is not clear exactly when this sentiment formed for Sahag n, he makes it clear that one of his goals is to demonstrate the worth of the peoples who had suffered devastation at the hands of Cort s and his forces. Early in the Florentine Codex, Sahag n quotes an Old Testament prophecy attributed to Jeremiah, asserting the similarities between the prophetic portents and the fate of the Indigenous peoples in the conquest of Mexico: Love History?

This people shall destroy you, and your women and children, and everything that you possess; and they shall destroy all your towns and buildings.\" This, to the letter, has happened to these Indians at the hands of the Spaniards. They were so utterly trampled upon and destroyed, with all of their things, that no resemblance was left of what they were before. (Book 1, folio vir, translated by Garagarza) Sahag n further laments that the native peoples are perceived as barbarians despite the fact that their styles of governing, as he puts it, are \"far ahead of many other nations that presume to be highly civilized\" (Book 1, folio vir, translated by Garagarza). Atlalli Aztec Irrigation The Florentine Codex (CC BY-NC-ND) Sahag n continues his praise of the Indigenous people particularly their educational systems, rhetoric, and achievements in arts, sciences, and technologies throughout the rest of the Florentine Codex and even compares the cultures of Mesoamerica to Troy, Rome, Carthage, and Venice, emphasizing their similarities to those highly esteemed civilizations of Europe. While he qualifies all of this praise with a notion of Mesoamerica being a place apart from the influence of God, where the devil has enjoyed prosperity, he nonetheless situates the native peoples of the Americas as kin to the Spanish and as mutual descendants of Adam. Suppression of the Codex In writing to his Spanish audience, whose perspectives likely would have been influenced by biased accounts from the conquistadors, Sahag n went far to assert the worth of the culture and heritage of Mexico's Indigenous population. In some ways, he went much further than would have been comfortable to his fellow Spaniards: For Spanish officials, particularly ecclesiastical authorities, words in native tongues were inherently suspect and images potentially idolatrous; translation itself might camouflage heretical ideas and harbor dangerous political meanings. (Peterson & Terraciano, 14) Almost certainly aware of this idolatrous potential, Sahag n still championed a text largely written in Mexico's native tongue and richly illustrated by Indigenous artists. Even when King Phillip II of Spain (reign 1556-1598) ordered the confiscation of all manuscripts involving Indigenous history and religion in 1577, Sahag n may have withheld a copy of his codex, in defiance of the Crown, and offered to copy and send it again to be sure it was received. The codex was sent to Europe in the year of the decree, was acquired by the Medici family in 1587, and disappeared from the historical record for nearly two centuries. The codex was rediscovered in 1793, but was not actually studied until 1879, and was inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2015.",

        "title": "Peasant Life in a Medieval Manor: The Family of Bodo, Carolingian Farmers",
        "content": "Bodo was a early 9th-century Frankish farmer. He and his family hailed from a manor owned by the monastery of St.-Germain-des-Pr s near Paris and worked as its tenants. He ploughed the farmlands while his wife, Ermentrude, took care of their household. Their lives give us a lively image of what daily life was like as peasants living in a manor in the Carolingian world of the early Middle Ages. Manors formed the very basic economic and social structure of early medieval Europe. A land estate owned by a feudal lord, not only was the manor the heart of agricultural production, it was also a centre for local political, social, and cultural activities. The monastery of St.-Germain-des-Pr s kept a detailed list of the names of the tenants and other people doing business with them of this period, called the Polyptych. Remove Ads  Detail of March from Les Tr s Riches Heures Mark Cartwright (CC BY-NC-SA) To manage their large estate, the then abbot of the monastery, Irminon (c. 820s), compiled this list, and the text is now preserved in a 9th-century manuscript in Paris (Biblioth que nationale de France, Ms Latin 12832). Along with Bodo were 10,000 other names located in 25 different villages, detailing their names, occupations, and most importantly, the sort of obligations (rent and labour) owed to the monastery. It was from this fiscal data that we can track and reconstruct the life of Bodo and his wife as well as their three unnamed children. Social Status & Experience Before discovering details of their daily lives, it is important to first note the social status of Bodo and his family, as this was very important in determining what was expected of them. Bodo and his family were not slaves and thus enjoyed a degree of freedom, but it is also true that the state of being enslaved and free was not binary in the Middle Ages, and often, it is more precise to talk about the degree of (un)freeness or freedom a person enjoyed under various circumstances. Remove Ads  it is crucial to note the state of being enslaved and free was not binary Christianity formally forbids slavery, but in actual practice it was more about how free and (un)free was one's experience in social, economic and political spaces since the breaking down of the western parts of the Roman Empire. In the old Romanland that now belonged to the various Germanic tribes and the kingdoms they established, there were coloni, free framers only in a sense that they were not subjected to anyone s servitude, but they were, nevertheless, bounded by and depended on their lands and thus had little mobility. Then we have serfs, who were attached to and depended on the estates of their owners. While a serf could not be sold as a person, they were sometimes exchanged during a land transaction. Other than the land labour, serfs also had to perform other household work for their owners. Lastly, there were free peasants who owned the land and were responsible for their own gains and losses. As freemen, they did not owe any rent or labour and could even provide paid work to feudal rulers. Their independence, however, was fragile, as any crop failure or any unfortunate circumstances like the population plundering from other lords could lead to them being subjected to a feudal ruler and becoming coloni or even serfs. Polyptych of Irminon, folio 2r Biblioth que nationale de France. D partement des Manuscrits (Public Domain) Bodo and his family were attached to the monastery and had a variety of obligations to it. This was what the Polyptych of Irminon recorded. They lived in one of the villages with other peasants of similar status. We know some of Bodo's neighbours  names: Frambert, Ermoin, and Ragenold, and they all had their own family. The circle of peasant farmers and workers was likely the most common social relationship Bodo could forge. He might meet the estate manager from time to time, and even the people from the monastery itself. But the monastery was a closed community, and outside visits were a rarity. Only a traveling merchant might visit the monastery on occasions, although even a royal visit was not impossible, and for someone like Bodo, the sight of a great king or noble marching on the road, perhaps with a newly received gift from a distant Caliph such as an elephant, could be the view, talk, and memory of a lifetime. Remove Ads  Daily Routine Bodo and Ermentrude had busy days throughout the year, and only on rare occasions and important festivals or religious holidays could they find some rest and enjoy a break from the many obligations they had. Bodo had to wake up early and go to the farm of the monks with the other peasants, as this was their main labour. They had to bring their own tools for ploughing and certain gifts (eggs, vegetable etc) to bribe the steward there for an easy day. The obligations Bodo shared were divided into the following: Field work, which was a fixed amount of labour on the land, Corv e, meaning unfixed ploughing when needed, and lastly, military service, in the form of paying money or supplying livestock to the soldiers. There was, too, public service, that is, participating in the maintenance of the village infrastructure whenever needed. Any day could be a trial of hardship for Bodo, and the work must often have seemed endless from morning to evening, as one early medieval writer imagined:  Oh sir, I work very hard. I go out in the dawning, driving the oxen to the field and I yoke them to the plough every day I must plough a fall acre or more, after having yoked the oxen and fastened the share and coulter to the plough  Yes, indeed it is very hard work!' (Aelfric, Colloquium, in The Welding of the Race, 449-1066, p95) The Feudal Society in Medieval Europe Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) Ermentrude also had a busy life. She had to work in the workshop with other women, spinning, dyeing, and sewing garments as well as making other daily accessories. Carolingian kings, in their legislation, provided a very detailed list of what was expected of a peasant woman s daily labour: For our women s work, they are to give at the proper time the materials, that is linen, wool, woad, vermillion, madder, wool combs, teasels, soap, grease, vessels, and other objects which are necessary. And let out women s quarters be well look after, furnished with houses and rooms with stoves and cellars, and let them be surrounded by a good hedge, and let the doors be strong, so that the women can do out work properly. (Charlemagne s capitulary, De Villis, c.45) After fulfilling her part of the tenant s obligations, Ermentrude then needed to go to the small family farm and work on it. This included looking after the livestock and watering the vegetables. Only after all these tasks had been completed could she return to her own household to look after the children, prepare meals for them, clean the house, and make new clothes for the family for the winter to come. Remove Ads  When Bodo returned at the end of the working day, the family would immediately eat supper and then go to bed, for a day s labour was physically exhausting for both adults, and opportunities for rest did not come too often during the working day. Nor would they have much by way of evening entertainment, for after sunset, darkness shrouded the entire house. Sleep was what both men and women who worked tirelessly on the farmlands, workshops, and household needed, for tomorrow would be no different than today or yesterday. February, Les Tres Riches Heures Limbourg Brothers (Public Domain) The Medieval Agricultural Revolution There was a substantial decline in agricultural intensity across the post-Roman West which can be measured by the decrease in buildings, trade networks, and the quality of the agricultural production, both primary like grain and secondary such as coins or pottery. However, by the later first millennium, at least in northwestern Europe, some major trends that had slowly taken place allowed a recovery, if not intensification, of agricultural production. First, instead of the Two-field System, farmers began to adopt the Three-field System. The Two-field System meant farmland was divided into two sections, with crops growing on one half of it while the other half was left ploughed and harrowed but not sowed. Under the new pratice, one third of the land would be sown with winter crops and one third summer ones, allowing greater food production through a more fertile land. As a result, food surpluses became increasingly common and there was a stable growth of population that saw the number of households almost doubled. More farmlands were cultivated and trade beyond the local community started to appear. There was also a small and localized urbanization, as either the villages located in the pre-existing key trading route or recently brought into the commercial network experienced a fair degree of population and infrastructural growth. Remove Ads  What did all this mean for peasants like Bodo? For once, they would have another way out of the very land that provided their life but also tied them to it. All of Bodo and Ermentrude s three children would have a better chance of surviving the world and more opportunities to explore it. This was not to paint a better picture in general, because by all accounts peasants like Bodo were still very much subjected to economic, social, and political oppression from the powerful. But in some ways that would be eventually transformative of the entire medieval European world, peasants firsthand experienced the benefits of the changes in land production, and their lives became somewhat improved. Conclusion The story of Bodo was reconstructed from the manorial record of the monastery of St.-Germain-des-Pr s. Other than being an important spiritual centre, the monastery also operated as the economic hub of the newly formed Carolingian Empire. Keeping a detailed and accurate record of tenants like Bodo was essential for the purposes of taxation, military service, land transactions, and other forms of economic exchange between the peasants, the monastery, and the court. Regarding the kings and emperors, whose luxurious lifestyle had to be sustained by the labour of the peasants, much has been written on them. Yet 99 percent of medieval people were just like Bodo, or Ermentrude and their three unnamed children, whose destinies were closely tied to the fortune of the land in early medieval Europe, and all we have on them, and on their world, is the Polyptych. While this was but a glimpse into their lives, the Polyptych makes possible to see the working of an early medieval manor, and the people who spent their entire life in it with very little possibilty of ever experiencing the greater outside world.",

        "content": "The First World War (1914-18) was the first truly global conflict and the first to be fully mechanised. Armies clashed across continents on land, in the air, and at sea. Civilians were caught up in the destruction as never before. In this article, we tell the story of WWI through the words of those who were there. British & German Troops, Christmas Truce. Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The Trenches of WWI Despite Germany's hopes that its prepared Schlieffen Plan would win a swift victory over France and its allies, the First World War settled down on the Western Front to a static one of trench warfare. Other fronts developed in Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers poured into these fronts from all sides involved in the conflict, many amongst them keen for action and eager to do their patriotic duty. The public was equally enthusiastic in the early days of the war. One French infantry officer recalls the scene as his train carrying troops to the front set off from Paris: Remove Ads   without any signal, the train slowly steamed out of the station. At that moment, quite spontaneously, like a smouldering fire suddenly erupting into roaring flames, an immense clamour arose as the Marseillaise burst from a thousand throats. All the men were standing at the train's windows, waving their k pis. From the track, quais and the neighbouring trains, the crowds waved back Crowds waved back at every station, behind every barrier, and at every window along the road. Cries of 'Vive la France! Vive l'arm e' could be heard everywhere, while people waved handkerchiefs and hats. The women were throwing kissed and heaped flowers on our convoy. The young men were shouting: \"Au revoir! A bient t\" [Goodbye. See you soon!]. (Keegan, 72) A similar zeal for battle was seen across the world and, undeniably, there quickly built up a pressure from peers and society to 'join up and do one's bit', as here recalled by one New Zealand soldier: University classes emptied sports fixtures were abandoned. To be left behind was unthinkable. If your mate was going, then somehow you had to get away too. (Keegan, 242) Sentry Post, Western Front 1918 T.K.Aitkin - Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Canadian soldier Victor Wheeler recalls the impact on local French farmers as war descended on them by chance in October 1914: Remove Ads  With pick and shovel we dug trenches through beautiful fields of grain, fully realising what damage we were doing to the farmers' hopes of reaping small harvests that would enable them to stem hunger during the coming winter. The patriarch with his ox-drawn plough, the matronly gleaner, and the young woman gathering grass and leaves, stood arms akimbo, wordlessly, helplessly, hopelessly watching. The depressing effect on the morale of the men   to many of whom raising grain on the Western prairie also meant their livelihood   could not be easily dismissed. (Yorke, 28) The reality of trench warfare soon set in. Ernst J nger, a German soldier, gives the following description of the trench he lived and fought in: To rest in, there are dugouts, which have evolved by now from rudimentary holes in the ground to proper enclosed living quarters, with beamed ceilings and plank-cladded walls. The dugouts are about six feet [1.8 m] high, and at a depth where there floors are roughly level with the bottom of the trench outside. In effect, there is a layer of earth on top of them thick enough to enable them to survive oblique hits. In heavy fire, though, they are death-traps The whole thing should be pictured as a huge, ostensibly inert installation, a secret hive of industry and watchfulness, where, within a few seconds of an alarm being sounded, every man is at his post. But one shouldn't have too romantic an idea of the atmosphere, there is a certain prevailing torpor that proximity to the earth seems to engender. (J nger, 40-41) Machine guns and artillery shells caused total carnage amongst infantry troops unimaginatively deployed again and again by their generals to cross the no man's land between rival trench systems. A German soldier, F. L. Cassell, recalls: Remove Ads   the shout of the sentry, 'They are coming' Helmet, belt and rifle and up the steps in the trench a headless body. The sentry had lost his life to a last shell there they come, the khaki-yellows, they are not twenty metres in front of our trench They advance slowly fully equipped machine-gun fire tears holes in their ranks. (Keegan, 295) Medical Officer, British Trenches, 1918 T.K.Aitkin - Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) In those trenches between Allied and Turkish troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula, a similar story is recorded by British soldier Vere Hamsworth in a letter home: We spent four days in the front-line trench. We had only a few casualties. We were put there just after a big attack which had partially failed and the ground between our trench and the Turks were strewn with bodies. It strikes me that they will be there for a long time. In this the body and face turn quite black in less than 24 hours and the smell is terrific. The flies   which are everywhere   also add to the general discomfort. (Williams, 37) New weapons used in the trenches, like poison gas shells, caused bewilderment, dismay, and terrible deaths, as here recalled by British soldier Walter Clarke: You didn't know, they were only just shells. But what happened, these shells when they burst they'd drop all on the floor, liquid. And in the morning the mist, there's always a mist there every morning, that was coming into the air and you were breathing it all in. Nobody knew until one or two chaps started being sick and a lot of the fellows were laying about going blind and sores all over their eyes. And then they realised what it was. (Imperial War Museums) The seriously wounded were taken to military hospitals behind the lines, often staffed by volunteer nurses. Britisher Daisy Spickett was one such nurse, and here she explains why she joined the medical services: Remove Ads  I always had in mind that I wanted to nurse and as soon as I heard of any talk of forming Red Cross Hospitals I began to make enquiries. I heard also that there was a likelihood of the War Office wanting volunteers for military hospitals, and that was what I decided I wanted. It seemed to me the only hope of getting right into the middle of everything, getting abroad and doing whatever was going, and the idea of the Army attracted me   being in the Army. But it seemed to me the thing I wanted more than anything else and that was how I put my name down for military hospitals and got my posting in July 1915. (IWM) Christmas Truce, Illustrated London News Arthur Cadwgan Michael (Public Domain) Even amongst the horrors of the trenches, there were brief respites, the most remarkable being the Christmas truce of 1914, when several separate groups of soldiers along the Western Front met and exchanged gifts with the enemy. Elsewhere, messages of goodwill were simply shouted across no man's land, as here recorded by Lieutenant Edward Hulse:  there were wafted towards us from the trenches opposite the sounds of singing and merry-making, and occasionally the guttural tones of a German were to be heard shouting out lustily, 'A happy Christmas to you Englishmen!' (Lawson-Jones, 91) Trench life, endured for over four years for the lucky ones, came to be seen as an unchanging past, present, and future. Daily life in the trenches was recorded with a sort of disdainful nostalgia in popular songs such as this one written by the Australian soldier and poet Tom Skeyhill: I've a little wet home in the tench; Which the rain-storms continually drench; Blue sky overhead, Mud and clay for a bed, And a stone that we use for a bench. Bully beef and hard biscuits we chew; Shells crackle and scare, But no place can compare With my little wet home in the trench. Remove Ads  (Yorke, 46) WWI U-Boat & Crew Imperial War Musuems (CC BY-NC-SA) At Sea & in the Air WWI, of course, involved battles at sea and in the air. Alfred Fright, then still a teenager, recalls the greatest time of stress was waiting for any action to happen, as it inevitably would, sooner or later: Whilst you was waiting for it you was absolutely dead scared, dead scared. But once it started it was fine and you seemed to lose it all. But up until that point, as I say, you was dead scared. And I know I've stood on the bridge sometimes and cried with being scared. And also I've stood on the bridge   cos we used to have to do lookouts, you see, that was our job mostly, boys. Course the ship sways that much you go three times that much up at the top mast head you see. And I've stood up there with these glasses to my eyes, froze to death and crying. That's the sort of life it was in them days. (IWM) British officer S. Pawley remembers a battle when he served on board HMS Glasgow: We formed into battle line ahead with the Otranto on our port side at some distance and steamed north. It was not very long before smoke appeared on the horizon and we soon discovered this smoke came from two German heavy cruisers. And we were able to recognise Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. We were not long in closing on the enemy and soon the battle commenced. The Good Hope opened fire, a ranging shot, which fell short and then the battle became general. I was standing on the upper deck at the time; the sea was very rough under a leaden sky. At times the waves came clean overboard, came clean in over. We were hit in several places. One of our mess decks was flooded; the captain's cabin was wrecked; the signalman's arm was blown off in the foretop; holes were knocked in the coal bunkers and we were in a generally poor condition. (IWM) Aircraft became an important means of observation on the enemy and were used as bombers of strategic targets like supply dumps, bridges, and railway lines. Life in the air was glamorous but precarious, as here recalled by Royal Air Corps pilot Frederick Powell: Well I think, not only 40 Squadron, but every RFC Squadron, the centre of the squadron seemed to be in the bar. That may offend a lot of people in these days, but it is perfectly true. And when you think of these boys, with the tensions they lived through, through the day, and they came in, in the evening, and then asked about their best friend, 'Where's he? I miss old George'. 'Oh, he bought it this afternoon'. 'Oh, heavens'. Now the gloom would come into a mess; the morale would die and the reaction immediately was, 'Well, come on chaps, what're you going to have?' That was the sort of spirit that kept going. I still think that it played a magnificent part in keeping up the morale of our troops generally. (IWM) Woman Working in a WWI Ammunitions Factory George P. Lewis - Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Civilians in WWI As millions of men on all sides left their homes to fight, women were encouraged to replace the lost workers, particularly in vital industries like arms manufacturing and agriculture. Working in factories could be dangerous work, as here explained by one visitor to a German ammunition factory: The working conditions were like what they must have been under early capitalism. There was always 'something wrong'. Especially during the night shift. Never a night passed without one or more of the women collapsing at their machines from exhaustion, hunger, illness On many days in winter there would be no heating  (Strachan, 157) Civilian workers could become casualties of unexpected events, such as this explosion in a British weapons factory, recalled by Ethel M. Bilbrough: No news came that night, but next day we heard that it was the most awful explosion of its kind ever known, as a munitions factory in East London at Silverton had caught fire somehow (Ah! How?) and the fire spread until it reached all the explosives and then the whole place was hurled up into the air, and four streets were demolished, and the dead and the dying and the injured lay amongst the ruins, so that when a relief party arrived they hardly knew where to begin. Over 100 people were killed, and more than 400 injured and disabled. (Williams, 53). The Zeppelin bombing raids of WWI involved terrifying new machines that could attack anywhere in the dead of night. Civilians were now brought into the realm of war, no matter how distant the front lines were. David Kirkwood describes a Zeppelin attack on Edinburgh in April 1916: Suddenly a terrifying explosion occurred. Windows rattled, the ground quivered, pictures swung. We all gasped. I ran to the window and saw Vesuvius in eruption. I opened the window. A great flash greeted me from the castle and then, above the roaring, I heard the most dreadful screeching and shouting. (Williams, 41) WWI Zeppelin Leaving its Hangar Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Remembrance The First World War ended in 1918, but for many, the effects would last a lifetime. Injuries, shocking memories, personal losses, and the difficulties of reintegrating into civilian life haunted many. Shell shock, the physical and psychological effects of shell fire, was one such lingering effect of this new and terrible modern warfare, as explained by British soldier Bertram Steward: Love History?

The strain of continual bombardment   continual, not just one bomb and then a quarter of an hour and another one but continual bombardment all the time pounding and pounding away. Now I think that's what people didn't understand, they heard of people having shell shock but what happened was everybody had shell shock who went through that sort of thing. It manifested itself in different ways. One of my friends who went out there, when he came back after the war he was accustomed to shut himself up in his home or in his garden and he wouldn't come out at all and nobody could get him to. He finished up   he was a great athlete, a good boy at school   he finished up in a lunatic asylum and died only within a year or two of the finish of the war. (IWM) For those who survived, the act of remembrance each 11 November helped keep memories of the lost alive and recognise the great sacrifices made. Many poems were written for the fallen, but one of the most enduring is 'For the Fallen' by Laurence Binyon, who himself served as a medical orderly in France:",

        "title": "1918 Flu Pandemic: The Deadliest Pandemic in History",
        "content": "Fort Porter Flu Patient US War Department (Public Domain) The Spanish flu (so-named because the Spanish press openly reported on the outbreak while other World War I belligerents suppressed the news) broke out in March 1918 at Camp Funston, an army camp in Kansas, and struck young, healthy adults with greater ferocity than any other demographic group. Occurring in three waves (March-September 1918, September-December 1918, Spring-Summer 1919) and affecting nearly 500 million people worldwide, the death toll reached 50-100 million people. The conditions of the First World War, poor hygiene, overcrowded hospitals, poor eating habits, and the general lack of knowledge and treatment for viral infections all contributed to its lethality. Origin & Spread The pandemic started in Haskell County, Kansas. Known both for its cattle and hog herds, it was also the flyway for 17 migratory bird flocks. It seems most likely that the birds infected the hogs, and the hogs infected humans. In January-February 1918, Dr. Loring Miner reported the initial cases to the United States Public Health Service. As carriers of the virus, recruits reported for military duty at Camp Funston spread the disease to others in the camp during March-April 1918. Remove Ads  In younger & stronger people, the immune system responded more intensely, causing the build-up of fluids in the lungs. In this early, springtime phase of the outbreak, despite the hundreds of cases, there were very few deaths. In April, soldiers from Camp Funston began the journey to France, while others were dispatched to other US military installations. The bases, transport trains and ships, and frontlines were crowded and unsanitary, creating ideal conditions for the spread of an airborne, infectious disease. At the peak of the pandemic in October-November 1918, the mortality rate amongst soldiers on the Western Front reached 2%, while reports from India indicated a mortality rate of 10%. The third phase of the pandemic in 1919 was worsened by soldiers returning from the war through ports and military bases along the coast. These types of occurrences became familiar in port cities all around the world. Remove Ads  The Virus The virus that struck the world in 1918-1919 was the H1N1 influenza A variant. The virus originated in wild waterfowl, which transferred to hogs and pigs, then evolved to be transmitted to humans. Carried through the air from person to person, the virus overwhelmed the immune system by quickly replicating and infecting the upper respiratory system. In younger and stronger people, the immune system responded more intensely, causing severe inflammation and the build-up of fluids in the lungs. With the body weakened, the influenza infection most often led to secondary infections, especially pneumonia. Upon exposure to the influenza virus, symptoms occurred within 2-3 days. The patient suffered from fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, headaches, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting. Unique to the 1918 pandemic was the presence of a bluish tint to the skin (turning to purple near death), known as heliotrope cyanosis. This condition led to the lungs filling with fluid, causing the patient to suffocate. Death usually occurred within 3-5 days of the onset of the illness. The mortality rate was highest amongst the poor, soldiers, health workers, and people working in occupations characterized by crowded working conditions. Remove Ads  Contributing Conditions In major urban areas, crowded buildings and workplaces and the increasing number of people provided the virus with an abundance of hosts. The overcrowding was often accompanied by poor sanitation, poor water quality, insufficient food supply, and poor personal hygiene. The war zones suffered from extreme overcrowding of soldiers and support personnel at the various military installations. The close living conditions at the camps, the conditions of trench warfare on WWI's Western Front, and troop ships helped the spread of the disease. Furthermore, poor sanitation, lack of proper nourishment, soldiers suffering from a variety of war wounds, and the low to non-existent natural immunity of the soldiers who had no previous exposure to the flu affected the spread. It was no wonder that the most affected demographic during the pandemic, especially in the fall of 1918, was the 20-40-year-olds, particularly soldiers and sailors. The Interior of a Hospital Tent John Singer Sargent (CC BY-NC) Medical science would not make the distinction between bacteria and viruses until the 1930s, and it would not be until 2005 that the 1918 flu virus genome was finally mapped. Quinine treatments, especially in Italy, used in malaria hospital wards, seemed to show some effectiveness as few patients developed the flu, although opponents to the treatment argued the lack of scientific data to support quinine treatments, and malaria patients did get the flu. Aspirin was tried, but too often the doses administered were too high, leading to a build-up of fluids in the lungs and ultimately to death. Remove Ads  Another medicinal approach was mass vaccination. In England and the United States, doctors used a variety of vaccines, sometimes in combination with each other. The results of the vaccination campaigns were mixed. In 1918, the available vaccines were meant for bacterial infections, which caused some flu patients to become even sicker, while patients receiving a bacterial vaccine for pneumonia seemed to avoid death more successfully. Antibiotics were not available in 1918 to address secondary bacterial infections; the first antibiotic was only introduced after the discovery of penicillin in 1928. Public Health Measures Lacking any effective medical responses to the outbreak, communities relied on public gathering bans, including closures of private businesses, distancing, and masking. Closures included cinemas, theaters, and saloons/bars, however, it was not unusual for saloons to completely ignore orders. Public health officials filed lawsuits to compel businesses to comply, but court rulings were mixed. In some cases, courts ruled that the closure orders of health authorities did not apply, while other courts allowed the closures for a limited time only, as long as the epidemic was present in the community. As the pandemic dragged on, financial losses and job losses for businesses lessened their cooperation with officials. All the restrictions & limitations of conducting business & consumption were cast in patriotic terms. The pandemic did not produce an economic crisis, although late 1918 and early 1919 experienced a mild recession due to the scaling back of war production. The flu most affected leisure and entertainment workplaces, but in 1918-1919, people had little money to spend on those activities. The war had already taught consumers the need to restrict their spending, so the addition of a pandemic had a negligible effect on consumption. Most people labored in industries or agriculture, and illness among workers particularly hurt coal, steel, textile, and copper producers. In some cases, those industries were unable to fill government orders necessary for the war effort. All the restrictions and limitations of conducting business and consumption were cast in patriotic terms, not only to combat the pandemic but to free up scarce resources for the war effort. Remove Ads  Public establishments were no less affected, especially schools and churches. Again, the record was mixed in regards to both the cooperation of local authorities and the effectiveness in combating the outbreak. Some clergy openly defied closure orders, while some congregations simply met in other places rather than their usual church buildings. Precautions Against Influenza G. L. Angeny (Public Domain) Recognized by doctors and other medical personnel as the only form of protection from the virus, masking ordinances were enacted in many places. Since the pandemic broke out during the war, public health campaigns encouraged people to wear a mask as a sign of their patriotic duty, but resistance to mask-wearing was high. Public Responses Public responses varied from place to place, largely at the state or city level. There was recognition that many of the responses would be costly in social, economic, and legal terms. People engaged in behaviors rooted in the idea that cleanliness would be an effective preventative against the illness. Face masks, disinfection, and frequent hand- and food washing were encouraged. There were attempts to sanitize public buildings and public transportation. Products in the cleanliness campaign included lime milk, soda lye, and steaming bedding and laundry. Cleaning and ventilating homes often was also advised. People were recommended to avoid crowds both indoors and outdoors, as those were one of the greatest risk factors in the spread of the illness. In some places, bans were enacted, although many people ignored the measures, which led to an increased number of ill people and deaths. People were also recommended to stay out of public spaces, especially if they were showing symptoms of the flu or were infected. Isolating individuals and families at home helped to combat the spread. US Public Health Pamphlet for 1918 Flu US Public Health Services (Public Domain) Other well-meaning advice to combat the flu included eating simple, well-cooked meals, not spitting on floors, and avoiding strong air drafts. Of course, there were also recommendations that not only proved futile but were, in fact, quite silly, such as camphor ball necklaces, gargling, fumigation, carbolic spray, eating onions, and assembling in large gatherings in order to spread the germ so people might develop natural immunity to the disease. Consequences The pandemic ended by late spring in 1919. By that time, nearly one-third of the world's population had been infected, and roughly 3% of the world's population died (50-100 million people). Those who suffered the most were in the 25-40-year-old demographic. The influenza pandemic produced lasting consequences, apart from the number of people who fell ill or died, affecting public health measures, medicine   especially the emerging fields of epidemiology and virology   economics, art & literature, etc. No segment of human society was unaffected. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! The pandemic produced a whole host of medical innovations. Doctors learned of the effectiveness of blood transfusions from survivors to the sick, which ushered in the era of blood typing to make the transfusions compatible. As scientists developed a better understanding of the virus, and disease in general, by the late 1920s/early 1930s, researchers, using the new electron microscope, developed techniques to view the virus. Simultaneously, scientists began growing the virus in chicken eggs, which allowed them to discover two types of influenza: A and B. By the late 1930s, British and American scientists began testing a new vaccine to combat influenza. In 1944, the vaccine was used on soldiers, and the following year witnessed the mass vaccination of civilians. Those early flu vaccines contained both types of viruses, which would result in the multi-virus vaccine in use today. The tools used to create these early flu vaccines were also used to develop vaccines for other infectious diseases. The research would enhance medical science's understanding of genes, leading to the cracking of the genetic code of human DNA in 1944. Letter Carrier in 1918 Flu Pandemic US War Department (Public Domain) Writers and artists during and in the post-WWI era reflected the suffering and death caused by the pandemic. Virginia Woolf's character, Clarissa Dalloway, in Mrs. Dalloway (1925), suffered from a heart condition caused by the flu. Anne Porter, author of Pale Horse, Pale Rider (1939), not only contracted the flu but her soldier-lover, who nursed her back to health, would die from the flu, which he contracted from her. T.S. Eliot, in 1922, wrote Wasteland, which described society in the aftermath of war and disease as a wounded land, both wasted and decapacitated. Ahmed Ali's Twilight in Delhi (1940) highlights the 1918 flu pandemic as a symbol of the ending of the old order, the economic disruption, and loss of memory that humans have for earlier pandemics, making them unprepared for the 1918 outbreak. Artists depicted the themes of trauma and despair while themselves suffering from the illness. Gustav Klimt (1862-1918) died from a stroke caused by the flu. Edvard Munch (1863-1944) and John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) contracted the disease but survived. Sargent had been sent to the front by the British government to sketch the joint actions of British & American troops. In the post-war period, various art monuments reflected the theme of hopelessness and ways in which people tried to cope with war & disease. Dadaism, the Bauhaus, and the abstract art movement engaged in new forms, created more practical and useful objects, or departed from reality to go beyond literal ideas and emotions. Lastly, in the realm of social sciences, the 1918 pandemic undermined the eugenic & social Darwinism movements. The disease struck everyone regardless of class, status, income, age, etc. The pandemic undermined the idea that there existed some group of 'superior' people in society. The flu undercut the notion that people were somehow responsible for catching diseases, either due to some character flaw or physical defect. No better example of this was the illness that struck the American president, Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), who became ill while attending the Paris Peace Conference to sign the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Wilson suffered from a fever, coughing fits, diarrhea, weakness, and confusion. Many writers have assumed that Wilson suffered a stroke while in Paris (a condition that struck him back in the United States while he tried to convince the US Congress and the American people to support the League of Nations), but in fact, Wilson caught the flu, shown by the symptoms he suffered from. The influenza pandemic swept the world, showing no favoritism toward any individuals, region, or nation, and became the deadliest pandemic of the 20th century.",
        "target_summary": "The Spanish Flu, an H1N1 influenza A variant, emerged in Kansas in March 1918 and rapidly spread globally in three waves, infecting nearly 500 million people worldwide. It was exceptionally lethal, causing 50-100 million deaths and disproportionately affecting young, healthy adults, often exacerbated by World War I conditions and secondary bacterial infections. Lacking effective medical treatments for viral infections, communities relied on public health measures like closures and masking, which ultimately spurred significant advancements in virology, vaccine development, and public health understanding.",

        "title": "HMS Victory: Nelson's Flagship & Oldest Ship of the Royal Navy",
        "content": "Smasher of Napoleon's invasion dream, veteran of three major wars, and scene of the death of the Royal Navy's greatest hero, HMS Victory is one of Britain's most famous warships. Curiously, and despite being on permanent display as a tourist attraction, Victory remains to this day a fully commissioned naval vessel. This is her story. A First-Rate Warship HMS Victory was constructed from 1759 at Chatham Dockyards in Kent to a design by Sir Thomas Slade. Built of solid oak and elm, the ship required the sacrifice of an incredible 2,500 mature trees. Completed in May 1765, the three-masted ship was over 227 ft (69 m) long and displaced 3,500 long tons. It was the largest ship yet built for the navy, and she was fast. In the right conditions, Victory could cut through the water with remarkable speed for her size thanks to 36 sails and an innovative hull design. Remove Ads  HMS Victory by Pocock Nicholas Pocock (Public Domain) Victory was far from being a positive name for most of the sailors first assigned to her. This was because the last naval ship named Victory had sunk in 1744, with all hands drowned. This new Victory, actually the seventh British naval ship to carry that name, had a long wait to see active duty: 13 years, in fact. The first-rate warship carried a crew of over 800 and positively bristled with more than 100 guns set along three cramped decks. Victory was a major weapon for the British in the 1770s during the American Revolutionary War. The ship was then refitted and made the flagship of Vice-Admiral Lord Hood, who sailed her around the Mediterranean in the early 1790s during the French Revolutionary Wars. Victory sported a new hull covering of almost 4,000 copper plates. Victory's fortunes then went into decline as her condition deteriorated. Serving as a hospital ship in 1797, Victory was slated to see out her days as a prison hulk, the ultimate fall from grace. The venerable old warship then received a last-minute reprieve. After the loss of HMS Impregnable in 1799, and with war looming against the old enemy, France, the Admiralty was obliged to bring Victory back into service. Remove Ads  A Major Refit Extensively refitted, Victory sported a new hull covering of almost 4,000 copper plates and a whole new complement of lighter, more accurate, and faster-loading cannons. Most striking of all, the ship was painted a distinctive dark grey with yellow stripes. Victory was once again ready for war and her finest hour. The famed artist John Constable selected Victory as the subject of one of his paintings, describing the ship as \"the flower of the flock.\" Stern View, HMS Victory Library of Congress (Public Domain) From 1803, Britain and Napoleon's France were at war. The Napoleonic Wars involved a vast array of European nations, but it was a crucial naval battle in October 1805 that scuppered Napoleon's planned invasion of Britain and established the Royal Navy as the world's foremost naval fleet. This battle was Trafalgar. Remove Ads  The Battle of Trafalgar Victory was selected as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson, England's finest commander of the period and already a national hero. In the two-year build-up to the great Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson never left Victory once, sleeping each night in his bed of preference, a suspended cot positioned between two giant cannons. The British fleet met the slightly larger French and Spanish fleets off Cape Trafalgar (on the southern coast of Spain). It was from Victory that Nelson issued his immortal signal: \"England expects that every man will do his duty.\" The Royal Navy won the battle thanks to Nelson's innovative tactics, where, risking the full force of enemy fire as the respective fleets closed in, he smashed through the centre of the enemy's more traditional formation of two lines of ships. Another factor in the Royal Navy's favour was the ability of its experienced gunners to fire twice as fast as those of the enemy. Horatio Nelson Lemuel Francis Abbott (Public Domain) Victory's crew at Trafalgar included Britons, Indians, Africans, Americans, and even three Frenchmen. There was one woman, too, a Minorcan disguised as a man. The youngest crew member was not yet 12, and the eldest was well into his sixties. Some men were volunteers, others were conscripts, and some were convicts. All had one goal: survive the battle. Remove Ads  The venerable old warship survived Trafalgar but was badly battered. Victory was certainly no bystander to the battle and knocked out no less a ship than the French Admirals' flagship Bucentaure. With 104 guns, Victory was a formidable foe. Firing cannons accurately on a rolling sea was far from easy and required teamwork. A 32-pounder   of which Victory boasted 30   weighed three tons and needed a crew of 12 to 15 men to operate. Victory also had two massive 68-pounders on her decks; one of these had caused carnage when it fired a barrel of 500 musket balls right through the Bucentaure's stern windows. The British ship did not escape unscathed; her huge wheel was shattered by cannon fire, and it took a team of 40 men to rig an alternative steering mechanism in the heat of battle. Incredibly, no British ships were lost in the battle, but there was a heavy price to pay for victory. In the chaos of sail, smoke, and smashed timbers, a sniper on the French warship Redoubtable had fatally hit Nelson while he prowled Victory's quarterdeck. At least the stricken commander lived long enough to learn of his great victory. The venerable old warship survived Trafalgar but was badly battered, both in the battle itself and in the storm which immediately followed it. Victory, obliged to stop at Gibraltar for vital repairs, carried Nelson home preserved in a barrel of brandy.

        "title": "Battle of Ashdown: The First Major Defeat of the Great Heathen Army",
        "content": "The Battle of Ashdown, fought on 8th January 871 in southern England, saw the Kingdom of Wessex defeat the Great Heathen (Viking) Army. This was the first major defeat of the Viking army, which had arrived in England in 865 and had conquered several Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. While the conflict between the Wessex and the Vikings continued for several months into 871 and beyond, Ashdown demonstrated that the Viking army could be defeated, giving the English hope for future battles. Alfred the Great Statue, Shaftesbury Abbey Seth Whales (CC BY-SA) Wessex at the time was ruled by King Aethelred (reign 865-871), but his younger brother   and soon-to-be successor   Alfred the Great (reign 871-899), played a decisive role in the victory at Ashdown, proving himself a capable military commander and ensuring the West Saxon nobles backed his succession later in 871. Alfred spent most of his reign locked in a struggle with the Vikings, but secured his kingdom through victories at the Battles of Edington in 878 and the Battle of Buttington in 893. Remove Ads  Our knowledge of Ashdown relies heavily on The Life of King Alfred, a contemporary biography of the king written by his advisor and tutor, Bishop Asser. It presents a pro-Alfredian version of Ashdown, yet it nevertheless provides the most detailed contemporary account of a battle in 9th-century Britain, offering invaluable insights into Anglo-Saxon warfare. Vikings Raids England in the 8th century was divided into several kingdoms: East Anglia, Mercia (Midlands), Northumbria (northern England), and Wessex (southwest England). The rulers of these kingdoms competed for wealth, land and prestige, often fighting wars and occasionally allying with one another. It was this world of Anglo-Saxon game of Thrones that the Vikings entered into toward the end of the century. Initially, they began as small groups of Scandinavian pirates, sailing south in the hope of wealth and plunder. They first attacked Wessex in 789 and then Northumbria in 793, where they notoriously raided the prestigious monastery of Lindisfarne. With their great stores of wealth and limited defences, coastal monasteries and trading ports quickly became favoured targets for Viking raids in Britain. Remove Ads  The Vikings would not long remain content with mere plunder; they soon wanted to conquer & settle in England, too. Around the same time, the Kingdom of Wessex was growing in power, and upon conquering Mercia-ruled Kent in 829, it became the most dominant of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. While its early 9th-century kings, Egbert (reign 802-839) and Aethelwulf (reign 839-858), were effective military leaders and enjoyed several victories against the Vikings, these raids were becoming increasingly difficult to halt. Even their wealthiest towns soon became valid targets, and around the middle of the 9th century, Canterbury, London, Southampton and Winchester were looted by the Vikings. Using hit-and-run tactics, the Vikings could sail toward and plunder a coastal target, then return to their ships, before the English   who did not have standing armies   could summon numbers large enough to fight the raiders. They would, however, not long remain content with mere plunder; they soon wanted to conquer and settle in England, too. Remove Ads  The Great Army In 865, an alliance of sea-kings and raiders   known by contemporaries as \"the Great Army\"   gathered in the North Sea. According to the Norse sagas, its leaders, Ivar, Halfdan, and Ubbe, were brothers seeking revenge for their father, who had been killed by an English king. They were remembered by the English simply as \"valiant but cruel men.\" East Anglia   the smallest of the English kingdoms   was their first target. However, King Edmund of East Anglia (reign 855-869) offered tribute to the Norsemen in exchange for a peace treaty. The invaders were provided with horses, silver, food supplies and were allowed to winter in East Anglia. Great Viking Army in England, 865-878 CE Hel-hama (CC BY-SA) The following year, their new equestrian companions were put to use as they rode into Northumbria, conquering York, its wealthy capital. Two Northumbria kings led attacks to reclaim the town, but along with several northern ealdormen (earls), they were defeated and died at York. One shrewd Northumbrian ealdorman, Egbert, however, had stayed clear of battle and aligned himself with the invaders. In exchange, he was appointed to rule over the northern regions of Northumbria (historically known as Bernicia) on their behalf. Meanwhile, the Viking took direct control of York and its surrounding lands. In 868, they turned south, capturing Nottingham in northwest Mercia and fortifying themselves within. The Mercian ruler, King Burgred (reign 852-874), had long been an ally of the West Saxons and thus requested help from King Aethelred of Wessex. Together, they placed Nottingham under siege, but for the Anglo-Saxon commander, fortress warfare was an uncommon experience. They were unable to attack Nottingham's walls directly, nor could they maintain their armies long enough to starve Ivar into submission. Therefore, the Vikings accepted tribute payment from Burgred, delivered in gold and silver, in exchange for peace. Each payment, no doubt, emptied the coffers of its payees and attracted new recruits from Scandinavia, who heard tales of the prosperity enjoyed by their kinsmen and friends in England. Remove Ads  The following year, the Vikings returned to East Anglia, capturing Thetford, but no amount of tribute would save Edmund this time. His army was defeated, before he was tracked down and brought before Ivar. Edmund was offered to be the Vikings' vassal, like Egbert of Northumbria, and upon his refusal, he was tied to a tree before being stabbed with spears and beheaded. Burgred of Mercia might now have understood the hollowness and temporary nature of a peace treaty with the Vikings. The Death of St Edmund Abbo of Fleury (Public Domain) 871: A Year of Battles Ivar was seemingly content with his work so far. Establishing dominance of England's east coast and the great trading centre of York, he next took his followers north to fight the Strathclyde Britons. This left Halfdan as the senior leader of the army in East Anglia. Known by the West Saxons as \"the tyrant,\" Halfdan was a Danish ruler who left behind his kingdom to carve out a new one amongst the British Isles (Aethelweard, 41). With Northumbria crushed, Mercia taxed and King Edmund martyred, Halfdan decided Wessex would be next. In December 870, he marched southwest from East Anglia, taking Reading on Wessex's northern border. The town was ideally situated as an invasion headquarters. Sitting on the Thames, it allowed new soldiers and supplies to flow in and provided an easy escape route if things went wrong. With the town surrounded on two sides by the Thames and the River Kennet, Halfdan built ramparts around the rest of Reading, making it an impregnable fortress. Remove Ads  \"Ashdown\" is often a term used to describe the whole of the northern Berkshire Downs, rather than a specific place. Upon arrival, a raiding party was sent out to the Berkshire countryside in search of plunder, slaves and supplies. All the while, a local nobleman and veteran of Viking warfare, Ealdorman Aethelwulf of Berkshire, was rallying his troops. His army fell upon the raiders at Englefield (5 miles or 8 km west of Reading), cutting them down from their horses and slaying their leader. A minor battle it might have been, but the first victory had gone to Wessex. To the south, more support awaited as King Aethelred was raising a large army to help Ealdorman Aethelwulf. As Aethelred and Aethelwulf came to the fortress, they slaughtered several unprepared Viking soldiers found outside its walls. Yet, taking the fortress was altogether a different task. The two leaders, Aethelred and Halfdan, had already met previously, during the siege of Nottingham in 868, when the Vikings were content to play the waiting game, before being paid to leave. Halfdan, however, would not repeat this strategy. He surprised his opponent and immediately confronted the West Saxons. As Asser explains: Like wolves, they burst out of all the gates and joined battle with all their might. Both sides fought there for a long time, and fought fiercely, but alas, the Christians eventually turned their backs, and the Vikings won the victory and were masters of the battlefield. (Keynes and Lapidge, 78) Amongst the dead outside Reading was Wessex's most celebrated war chief, Ealdorman Aethelwulf, a great blow to the king's campaign. Aethelred's army retreated westward, perhaps linking up with fresh soldiers arriving from Wiltshire and Somerset. Halfdan now felt he had the perfect opportunity to finish off Wessex for good. His experience in East Anglia and Northumbria taught him that the capture of a key town, followed by military victory and the king's death, led to the kingdom's surrender. So, he followed Aethelred west, hoping to inflict a second and fatal defeat upon him. Battle of Ashdown On 8th January 871, on a cold winter morning, the armies of Aethelred and Halfdan caught sight of one another amongst the northern Berkshire hills. However, where they stood is uncertain. \"Ashdown\" is often a term used to describe the whole of the northern Berkshire Downs, rather than a specific place. Yet most scholars suggest the battle likely took place among the hills west of the village of Moulsford, on the Oxfordshire-Berkshire border. We also know nothing of either army's size. While the West Saxons would have lost many outside the gates of Reading, fresh recruits from the west after the battle likely brought them back to a size similar to the Viking army, which had left behind a garrison to guard Reading. The army of Wessex was formed from a core of professional warriors serving in the household of the king and ealdormen, along with those of lesser status who owed military service to and were led by local landowning warriors (thegns). The soldiers on both sides were mostly armed with shields and spears, with axes more prevalent among the Vikings, and the elite West Saxon warriors bearing swords an expensive, rare weapon often passed down through generations. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! The Vikings had arrived first at the battlefield, taking the higher ground at Ashdown. As the two sides looked across from one another, Halfdan gave his first order. His army was to be divided into two, half led by him and his ally, King Bagsec, and the other half by several earls. As they spread out across the upper grounds of the Berkshire hills, Halfdan gave a second order, and his army duly formed a \"shield wall\"   a long front line of soldiers locking their shields together to guard against an incoming attack. Seeing this, Aethelred followed suit, splitting his army into two shield walls, with himself commanding one to oppose Halfdan and Bagsec, and his younger brother, Prince Alfred, commanding the other to face the Viking earls. However, before any fighting could begin, Aethelred returned to his tent for a pre-battle mass, praying for divine help. Some form of prayers or mass was not unusual before battle. The English were, after all, convinced that the Vikings had been sent to punish them for their sins. Holding himself responsible for the souls of his subjects, Aethelred was fighting both a physical and a spiritual war. Halfdan, however, had no interest in respecting Christian pre-battle rituals. He seized this moment of vulnerability to strike first. Abandoning the high ground, he and the Viking earls marched on Alfred, hoping to crush his army with their superior numbers. When Aethelred was informed, he declared he \"would not leave that place [the tent] alive before the priest had finished mass and that he would not forsake divine service for that of men\" (Keynes and Lapidge 79). Alfred would now have to take on both Halfdan and the Viking earls alone. \"With loud shouting from all,\" and Alfred \"acting courageously, like a wild boar,\" as Asser tells us, he strode forth to meet the Vikings (Keynes and Lapidge, 79). Artist's Impression of Alfred the Great The Creative Assembly (Copyright) The clash between the two armies sounded with a mighty \"thud\" as the walls of wooden shields smashed together. A shield wall versus shield wall clash often sank into a slow-moving shoving match. With little innovative strategy or creativity, in this battle of strength, power and determination, each side would seek to push the other back and break through their wall. Meanwhile, frontline warriors poked, jabbed, prodded and stabbed their spears at gaps in the wall, hoping to deliver lethal blows to their opposite number. Such a slow-moving contest suited Alfred; being vastly outnumbered, he could only hope to hold off the Vikings long enough for Aethelred to come to his rescue. Remove Ads  Eventually, Aethelred arrived, leading his troops in an ambush of the Vikings. Some scholars have even suggested that his delayed entry was a tactical move, rather than a religious one. Perhaps striking the Vikings' flank or rear, he relieved pressure on his brother and gained the upper hand over the invaders. The fight continued for several more hours, yet as the waning Viking army was attacked on two fronts, their shield wall crumbled and collapsed. The West Saxons surged through the breaches, hewing down their foes in great numbers. A 10th-century chronicler, Ealdorman Aethelweard, remarked, \"neither before nor after has such a slaughter been heard of.\" Asser recorded: Bagseg was killed, and Earl Sidroc the Old, Earl Sidroc the Younger, Earl Osbem, Earl Fraena, and Earl Harold . ... the entire Viking army was put to flight, right on till nightfall and into the following day, until such time as they reached the stronghold [Reading] from which they had come. The Christians followed them till nightfall, cutting them down on all sides. (Keynes and Lapidge, 80) Aftermath Halfdan's plans of a quick victory had been shattered. Just over a week into the war, a large chunk of his army and several of his leading allies had died. Wessex was not, after all, so weak as Northumbria or East Anglia. However, given his experience at Reading just a few days before, Aethelred would not assault the town again. It appeared that the conflict would be a stalemate. The Vikings were unable to conquer Wessex, and the West Saxons were unable to expel the Vikings. However, with the death of several allied Viking leaders   and potential rivals for command   Halfdan now commanded greater authority over the army. Perhaps to secure his complete leadership over this admittedly smaller force and replenish supplies, only two weeks after Ashdown, he led another raid into Wessex. His target was Basing, 15 miles (24 km) south of Reading. Outside the town, he was once again met by King Aethelred's army, but this time he defeated the West Saxons and took control of Basing. The conflict now reached an informal ceasefire, with two months of peace. The campaign was reignited in March, when the Vikings raided deep into Hampshire, where they defeated Aethelred at the Battle of Merton. Following the battle, a second Viking fleet (known as \"the great summer army\") sailed from the continent to Reading to assist Halfdan. Worse, during the battle at Merton, Aethelred had been fatally wounded. He only lived a few more weeks before dying in April 871. In accordance with arrangements made earlier that year, Alfred succeeded to the throne, ahead of his brother's infant sons, Aethelwold and Aethelhelm, who were not yet old enough to rule. Although he frequently suffered from a mysterious and severe illness, Alfred was 22 years old and had already proven his bravery during the battles at Reading, Ashdown, Basing and Merton. Swanborough Tump Memorial, Wiltshire Bikeboy (CC BY-SA) However, his reign began with a series of military disasters. While he was overseeing his brother's funeral and burial at Wimborne Minster, the army of Berkshire was defeated by the great summer army at Reading. Nearer to home, in May 871, Alfred himself was defeated in battle by Halfdan near Wilton, Wiltshire. This had dashed any hope Alfred had of a military solution. The only way the Vikings would now leave was by paying them. The payment (or \"danegeld\") would no doubt empty his coffers and make him unpopular with his new and now heavily taxed subjects. Remove Ads  While Halfdan had enjoyed a string of victories, he had not won a decisive enough victory to discredit support for Alfred. Nor had he intended to lead such a long campaign; thus, as his army grew smaller with each battle and supplies became ever more meagre, he accepted being paid to leave Wessex, retreating to London in the autumn of 871. As the year ended, Alfred could take solace in the fact that he kept his crown and kingdom, a fate better than Edmund of East Anglia or the Northumbrian kings. Legacy 871 had been a year of great significance for the Viking invasion. Significant death tolls were suffered by both sides, including several of the leaders involved. Wessex had, however, shown it was capable of defeating the Great Heathen Army in battle, something that no other kingdom had achieved so far. The war between the English and the Vikings would continue. Halfdan attacked Mercia in 874, forcing King Burgred into exile on the continent. He would subsequently shift his focus to Northumbria and Ireland, leaving the leader of the great summer army, Guthrum, to take up the fight against Alfred in the south. When Guthrum invaded Wessex in 878, he chased Alfred into the Somerset marshes, almost conquering the entire kingdom. Only several months later, when Alfred regathered the West Saxons, was he able to raise a large enough army to defeat Guthrum at the Battle of Edington. Alfred the Great Statue, Winchester Odejea (CC BY-NC-SA) Guthrum and Alfred soon agreed to a more lasting peace treaty, with the Viking leader converting to Christianity and southern England being divided between them, as the declining Mercian kingdom was carved into an English west and a Norse east. As Christian brothers, they endeavoured to uphold an imperfect peace between both sides until Guthrum died in 890. However, the next generation would continue the fight for supremacy, with Alfred's heirs   Edward the Elder (his son) and Aethelstan (his grandson)   extending West Saxon control over the rest of England.",

        "title": "Lend-Lease: The WWII US Aid Programme for Allies",
        "content": "Lend-Lease Machine Guns Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Lend-Lease (sometimes called Lease-Lend) was a programme of financial and material aid given by the United States to its allies during the Second World War (1939-45). Food, weapons, ammunition, and agricultural equipment were amongst the goods which crossed the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The value of Lend-Lease goods has been estimated at around $50 billion. Payment was expected from the recipient states, although there was flexibility on how much, in what form, and when this was to be given. Lend-Lease was a massive operation, which ensured the US minimised its own military casualties while still using its tremendous economic power to drive the Allied cause. The programme became one of the great logistical achievements of the war effort, immeasurably helping the Allies win WWII. Helping the Allies At the outset of the Second World War, the United States, wary of becoming embroiled in a conflict on another continent, remained officially neutral and so could not directly intervene militarily. Giving material aid to participants in a war had been prohibited by the mid-1930s Neutrality Acts. Even loans were restricted by the Johnson Debt-Default Act, which excluded those nations that had not paid back the money lent during the First World War (1914-18). This was a heavy restriction because the only country which had paid off all of its debts to the US was Finland. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was determined to break down the traditional US foreign policy of isolationism any way he could within the law, and so he summoned Congress to repeal parts of the legislation blocking aid for the Allies. First, France and Britain were permitted to purchase arms (provided they paid cash and transported the arms themselves), and then another Congressional decision allowed US merchant ships to enter war zones and carry arms and ammunition as cargo. There was now a way to legally send much-needed assistance to Europe and elsewhere, yet for the United States to remain neutral. Remove Ads  In total, over 38 countries received aid from the USA during the war. Roosevelt, faced with direct appeals for aid from figures like British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was even willing to bend the law a little. For example, the US President ensured British warships were repaired in US ports, and he sent warplanes to the USA's Canadian border, which allowed the Canadians to literally haul the planes into their own territory and then send them on to Europe. Another case involved an exchange of US destroyer warships for bases. Under this deal, the US promised to provide Britain with 50 destroyers (they received only 9 by the end of 1940), and in return, it acquired 99-year leases for several naval bases in the West Indies, Bermuda, Newfoundland, and British Guiana. Battle of the Atlantic, 1943 Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Roosevelt finally gained more freedom of action following the widespread outrage at the German U-boat attack on the US destroyer Kearny in October 1941 and the consequent repeal of many more restrictive neutrality laws. The US then went into full swing in its efforts to give aid to those defending freedom. Remove Ads  The Lend-Lease programme was designed, then, to give material and financial aid to those Allied nations which were fighting the three common enemies of the free world: Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan. As the name suggests, the programme did not give goods for free; recipients were expected to repay the costs, but there was flexibility in terms of both the amount and timing of the repayments. Beneficiaries of the Lend-Lease programme included Great Britain, the USSR, China, South Africa, Egypt, Australia, and New Zealand. In total, over 38 countries received aid from the USA during the war. The Issue of Payment As noted above, the US preferred cash for the goods sent via Lend-Lease. This soon became problematic since countries like Britain, not only suffering from the war but also from the consequent collapse in world trade, were running very low on cash reserves. With France's surrender in June 1940, Britain was left alone in Europe to face an aggressively rampant Germany and Italy. Britain could call on assistance from colonies like India and Australia, but the fact was that the size of the British Empire meant Britain was struggling both militarily and financially to protect its assets in South Asia, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. On top of that, Adolf Hitler seemed determined to launch a German invasion of the British Isles. Remove Ads  Many in the US could not believe the government that presided over the vast British Empire was strapped for cash, but that was the reality, and Churchill even offered to show the nation's accounting books to Roosevelt to prove it. The British ambassador to the US starkly stated: \"Britain's broke\" (Dear, 531). There was a gradual realisation amongst many Americans that Britain was, in effect, fighting a war so that the US could remain on the sidelines militarily. An analogy came into common circulation of the moral and practical benefits of loaning one's fire hose to a neighbour when their house was on fire. If Britain collapsed under the pressure, then there would be nothing to stop the authoritarian aggressors of WWII from turning their sights on North America and setting houses ablaze there, too. On the other hand, giving aid carried risks. US material aid to Britain was regarded by the aggressor nations as no different from being fully involved in the war. It did seem that continuing and even increasing aid would eventually lead to the US becoming militarily embroiled in WWII. Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1944 Leon Perskie (CC BY) Roosevelt did hold out hope that if enough aid were given, then US troops would not be needed in the conflict and US military casualties would be avoided. From December 1940, this attitude and that of the fire analogy meant Roosevelt was prepared to give material to the USA's democratic allies and not insist on particular conditions or exact figures of repayment. To continue the fire hose analogy, Roosevelt argued to Congress that if one's neighbour did manage to put out their fire but damaged the hose in the process, then compensation could be made not in terms of the precise cost of the hose but by an informal agreement that its value would be repaid in kind. A bill was passed by Congress in March 1941, and the US became the 'Arsenal of Democracy' as Roosevelt put it. Repayment terms were to be agreed according to what \"the President deems satisfactory\" (the wording of the legislation, quoted in Dear, 531), judging on a case-by-case basis. It should also be noted that many countries sent raw materials to the US, which were used to produce the manufactured goods they most needed. The US industries providing Lend-Lease goods positively boomed. Increasingly, as the war went on, payment was expected not in cash or goods but in concessions favourable to long-term US foreign policy and trade, such as opening up of closed markets and removing any restrictions previously applied to the US. There also remained some sticky issues, such as those who opposed giving aid to the communist USSR (which had become Adolf Hitler's principal enemy from the summer of 1941) and whether or not the US Navy should provide warships to defend the convoys carrying material aid to Europe and elsewhere. Remove Ads  Types of Materials Sent The Lend-Lease materials sent by ship and air were very varied indeed, ranging from eggs to tanks. Although all payment for goods required the approval of Congress, the only restriction made by President Roosevelt on what could be included in the Lend-Lease programme was that the goods were needed \"in the interest of national defence\" (legislation text, quoted in Dear, 531). There were, otherwise, no legal restrictions on what could be sent to Allied nations. From August 1941, the general production and supervision of goods was the responsibility of a new organisation, the Office of Lend-Lease Administration (OLLA). Lend-Lease Agricultural Equipment Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) A major component was food for Britain, where people endured a strict system of rationing. Britain not only received US-produced food like cheese and meat but also agricultural equipment, which could improve homegrown production rates on British farms. Another major success was the delivery of tens of thousands of trucks to the USSR's Red Army, effectively making this a truly mobile force for the first time. US-built tanks helped boost the Allied cause in the North Africa Campaign. Small- and large-calibre munitions were vital to keep guns firing in all theatres of the war. Engines and spare parts ensured machines of war of all kinds could continue to operate. The US industries providing Lend-Lease goods positively boomed. US war production was ramped up, and the huge logistical network required to transport the goods was quickly and efficiently developed. Most goods were delivered to Britain by merchant ships operating in convoys for greater safety. Goods not destined for Britain were then shipped on to places like Murmansk and the Persian Gulf. Lend-Lease production also had to face competition from the demands of the US military once the United States became fully involved in the war following the attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941. There was certainly a shortage of merchant ships in 1942, but production of these caught up with demand by 1943. Ultimately, Lend-Lease bases were established around the world from Australia to Chile to Morocco to China. Many such bases benefited from an expansion of local rail and road networks. Some aircraft were flown to their destination, often by civilian pilots, including women. Remove Ads  The Lend-Lease programme was hugely successful in getting material to where it was most needed. The total cost of goods sent can only be estimated because of the sheer scale of the project, but The Oxford Companion to World War II states, \"between $42 and $50 billion of aid-food, military goods, oil, industrial production, and services went to America's wartime allies\" (532). Britain received more than anyone else, around half of those goods, while the USSR received around one-fifth. Lend-Lease Cheese Shipment Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The End of Lend-Lease The Lend-Lease programme continued to split US politics as the war went on. A Senate decision to continue the programme in the spring of 1945 only won against those senators who wished to end it by a single vote. There were claims (sometimes true) that states were welcoming goods under Lend-Lease but then exporting them elsewhere for profit. Some in the United States called for a reduction of aid to Britain, the argument being that state was surely capable now of standing alone and was only using US aid to strengthen its own future position in the post-war world. This was not true since, having been forced to give up assets to the US, Britain was particularly affected by the long-term repercussions of Lend-Lease, as the historian S. Ambrose explains: The Americans insisted that the British sell their overseas assets; this meant that at the end of the war the income that the British counted on and depended on for so long from her overseas investments was no longer there. They had been sold at American insistence The Americans then moved into the areas that had previously been British colonies, whether simple or economic colonies. So Britain was in a much weaker position at the end of the war than she had been at the beginning and was not in a position to recover. (Holmes, 129) There had been (albeit vague) promises back in 1944 that Lend-Lease would continue after the war to help the much-needed and extremely costly task of rebuilding war-ravaged countries. Nevertheless, President Harry S. Truman, who took office in April 1945, immediately cancelled Lend-Lease following the Japanese surrender in August. Many governments felt let down by this decision, and Truman later admitted the programme should have continued for longer, although some states did receive substantial long-term loans, such as the $650 million lent to France in 1945. The question of repayments remained contentious. The USSR, for example, baulked at US demands to pay back an outstanding $2.6 billion. In fact, an agreement on the repayment terms was not reached until 1990. Lend-Lease did leave a more meaningful legacy in the longer term. The United States and other nations came to regard aid-giving as a necessary and mutually beneficial branch of foreign policy, an attitude that continues to hold favour today with many governments around the world.",

Building a Chinampa With the posts in place to establish the structure of the artificial island, laborers wove reeds, vines, & branches between them to create the enclosure. The word chinampa derives from the Nahuatl term chinamitl, meaning \"a fence made of plants\" or that which could be enclosed within a fence of plants. The labor-intensive process of building a chinampa began with locating a firm floor in the shallow area of a lake. There, laborers would drive wooden posts into the lake bottom. The designated area for the construction was usually rectangular, with lengths varying from 8 to 100 meters and widths ranging between 2 and 25 meters. Along with the posts, laborers planted willow trees, such as Mexico's native bonpland willows (Salix bonplandiana), in the corners or along the perimeter, where the roots of the trees would give structure to the nascent chinampa. The Florentine Codex depicts a willow tree growing out of blue waves; its simple, lance-shaped leaves that alternate along the stem are characteristic of the water-loving Salix genus. Remove Ads  With the posts in place to establish the structure of the artificial island, laborers wove reeds, vines, and branches between them to create the enclosure from which the chinampa derives its name. Once the fence of plants was completed, laborers began the arduous task of filling the enclosure with many layers of soil, at least some of which would have been scraped from the bottom of the lake itself, thus fortifying the fence with mud and further plant material. Once the chinamitl was stable and the raised mud and soil reached a height of 50 cm above the surface of the water, the top layer of soil was left to dry for several weeks before the land was used for planting. Huexotl Willow Tree Unknown Artist (CC BY-NC-ND) To control floodwaters and promote moisture content in the soil, laborers constructed sophisticated drainage systems including dams, sluice gates, ditches, dikes, and canals. Flowing between chinampa fields, the canals served as waterways and allowed those who worked the land to transport supplies, crops, and fertilizer directly to and from the artificial fields in the lake shallows. Capillary action drew water into the layers of soil in the chinampa, allowing adjacent canals to serve as reservoirs for an integrated subirrigation system that met the water needs of the crops and created a microenvironment that protected them from frost. In addition to the aquatic infrastructure required to sustain the chinampas, water reservoirs and fish weirs   fences placed in flowing water to direct the motion of fish   could also be constructed to set aside water for different tasks and to expedite fishing. Remove Ads  Fertilization & Maintenance In order to ensure the ongoing fertility of these human-made agricultural islands, farmers, known as chinamperos, employed a number of fertilization methods. One of these methods involved transferring mud, soil, sediment, and vegetation from the bottom of the canals to the top layer of the artificial fields. This process helped to maintain the canals while also renewing the topsoil of the chinampas for better planting. The soil from the canals contained a high build-up of organic material from decomposing plant matter, animal waste, and other waterborne debris, which facilitated water retention and kept crops from losing too much moisture during the dry season. This allowed for year-round cultivation, made efficient through the use of seedbeds to prepare new crops for planting even while others were being harvested. Adding fresh topsoil from the canals also helped to aerate the chinampas and promoted long-term fertility and high productivity. Other methods of fertilization included applying compost (including food waste, ash, charcoal, and excrement) and other organic materials. Using crop residue as mulch also helped to suppress the growth of weeds. With careful maintenance, chinampas in the time of the Aztecs could host a huge array of crops and flowers. Today's chinamperos, keeping alive the agricultural tradition, cultivate crops including maize, legumes (bush beans and fava beans), amaranth, tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, radish, seepweed, purslane, and many more. While the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica would not have had access to nearly as many domesticated animals, most of which are not native to the Americas, modern chinamperos often keep animals like chickens, cattle, swine, and sheep, feeding them on excess produce and adding their manure to the fertilization process. Remove Ads  Canals of Xochimilco Luis Bartolom  Marcos (CC BY-SA) Benefits of Chinampa Design for Agriculture & Ecosystem After hundreds of years, the chinampas still make it possible to grow crops in a lacustrine environment and promote the health of the local ecosystem. Within the chinampas themselves, the native willows planted at the perimeter of the fences serve as more than structural support. Fast growing and anchored by dense root systems that help prevent soil erosion, broad crowns of willow branches and leaves provide shade and create barriers against wind and pests. As the trees grow taller, they also provide a natural trellis on which vine crops can climb to facilitate better access to sunlight. The microecosystem of the chinampas supports biodiversity & plays host to beneficial bacterial & fungal species. The microecosystem of the chinampas also supports biodiversity and plays host to beneficial bacterial and fungal species. Because so much of the layered soil in the chinampas comes from the lakebed, algae, bacteria, and macrophytes proliferate in the soil. These organisms consume and convert the nutrients from decaying organic matter, storing excess nitrogen and phosphorus as a survival mechanism for use in nutrient-deficient conditions. Through this process, these bacteria increase the nitrogen reserves of the soil. When new soil is added to the surface, it introduces more organic matter and moisture, feeding the algae, bacteria, and macrophytes and propagating the nitrogen-fixing cycle. As an example of raised farming, chinampas are similar to structures from other parts of the Americas, including the raised gardens of Lake Titicaca, and other raised farming techniques have been recorded in regions including the Netherlands, Denmark, Russia, France, and Bangladesh. In all of these cases, raised farming techniques promote soil quality, aeration, and moisture content through drainage, and in some cases, like Mexico's chinampas, this technique enables agricultural production in environments where it would otherwise be impossible. While this was not an innovation of Aztec agriculture, it was perfected under the sway of their empire such that, in the 15th and 16th centuries, the chinampas of Mesoamerica fed hundreds of thousands of people. Remove Ads  Chinampas of Tenochtitlan, Lake Texcoco & Xochimilco When the Mexica (pronounced \"Me-SHEE-kuh\") people came to the Valley of Mexico, they found a land already dominated by other cultural and ethnic groups, and they depended on mercenary work to sustain themselves. After years of wandering in search of political security, the Mexica resolved to build their home on Lake Texcoco, taking a location that no one else wanted and transforming it into the heart of an empire. The Aztec civilization that rose from those swampy waters was so enduring that the symbol of the city's god-given founding portent   an eagle seated on a cactus eating a snake   remains the central element on the flag of Mexico today. Map of the Aztec Empire, c. 1427 1521 Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) Part of the reason that no other people had settled the region around Lake Texcoco was that Mesoamericans depended almost wholly on agriculture for sustenance. Supplemented by game animals and a very select few domesticated species, Mesoamerican peoples primarily ate fruits and vegetables and thus required a great deal of agricultural infrastructure. With little arable land around Lake Texcoco, chinampas emerged as an elegant and effective solution to the problem of food. The early Aztecs were most likely inspired by their rivals in Xochimilco, which means \"flowering fields\" in Nahuatl, where chinampas were already flourishing before the founding of Tenochtitlan. Resolved to thrive in their newfound home, the people of Lake Texcoco set about filling the shallow waters with farmland. The Florentine Codex describes a type of land called atlalli, which is a combination of atl, meaning \"water,\" and tlalli, meaning \"earth,\" in Nahuatl. In describing what makes this land unique from other forms of tlalli, the Nahuatl author tells us, \"This is the irrigated field. It is a watered garden, one which can be irrigated it is good, fine, precious; a source of food, esteemed; a place of fertility to be planted to maize, to be planted to beans, to be harvested\" (Book 11, folio 227v - 228r, translated by Anderson & Dibble). The image below shows a farmer at work, standing between tendrils and pools of water. The artist signifies the fertility of the land not only through the contrast of textures between the curling water and the tufted earth but also by the presence of stems and flowers, particularly some that resemble corn plants, near the end of the branches of moisture. Remove Ads  Atlalli Aztec Irrigation The Florentine Codex (CC BY-NC-ND) Over the course of the nearly two centuries of Aztec rule, chinamperos tended to the artificial island farms, and the government controlled and regulated all aspects of maintenance with an emphasis on economizing the use of time, produce, and waste. In fact, the fertilization of the chinampas was integrated into the lavatory practices of the people of the city. Inhabitants of Tenochtitlan relieved themselves in specialized huts built near city streets and alleys, where canoes would collect the human excrement. From there, it was transported directly to the chinampas, where it would be used as fertilizer along with plant matter and other nutrient-rich organic material. In addition to the fertilization methods mentioned above, Aztec chinamperos left their farm-islands fallow after two or three years of use to allow the soil to rest before further cultivation. Through this carefully organized system, Aztec-era chinampas could support seven different crops in their year-round cycle. Crop productivity was maximized by allowing seeds to germinate in seedbeds before being introduced to the chinampas. While other crops grew in the full-sized plots, farmers planted seeds in small squares of soil called chap nes, where they grew for a few weeks before being transplanted into the chinampa soil, fertilized, and gently covered with a layer of native straw and reeds. This layer of vegetation would protect the new seedlings from the sun and help trap the humidity in the soil. Finally, the crops were sprayed with a solution of ground chiles and water to control pests. Once fully grown, the crops were harvested, loaded directly into boats, and sent to the bustling markets that surrounded Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs, like many Indigenous American populations, employed, among other plants, a sort of sacred trinity of food crops: corn, beans, and squash. Sometimes known to Indigenous populations as \"The Three Sisters,\" these species thrive when planted together in a shared space because each of the crops provides some form of support for the others. Corn plants provide a natural trellis on which bean plants climb to thrive, and bean plants absorb nitrogen from the air, which they convert to nitrates that help fertilize the surrounding soil. Squash leaves provide ground cover that inhibits soil evaporation and the growth of weeds, ensuring their neighbors' access to moist, nutrient-rich soil. While the Aztecs would not have used the title \"The Three Sisters\" to describe their intercropping techniques, corn, beans, and squash were nonetheless staples of the Aztec diet, and the chinampa farming zones on Lake Xochimilco produced enough crops to feed approximately 100,000 people during the height of the Aztec empire. The Florentine Codex preserves an image of corn described as cintli: \"the white maize ear that of the irrigated lands, that of the fields, that of the chinampas.\" (Book 11, folio 246v, translated by Anderson & Dibble) Cintli Maize Plant Unknown Artist (CC BY-NC-ND) In addition to the crops needed to sustain Tenochtitlan's population, Aztec chinamperos often planted flowers in their floating island plots. Far from simply being a source of beauty, flowers were symbolically important throughout Mesoamerican cultures. Known as xochitl (\"SHOW-cheet\") in Nahuatl, flowers were also offerings in Aztec sacrifice rituals. Three deities who had particularly associations with them, Xochipilli, Xochiquetzal, and Macuilxochitl, were worshipped as patrons of the arts, beauty, and pleasure. Xochitl in cuicatl, meaning \"flowers and song,\" was a metaphorical turn of phrase in Nahuatl that could be used to refer to all manner of artistic endeavors, particularly the deeply valued Aztec art of poetry. Whether worn by dancing women during celebrations, carried to signify the presence of a god on earth, or offered to honor the gods on sacred days, the flowers of Tenochtitlan grew on chinampas. Chinampas Today Recent surveys show that chinampas were in use in Mesoamerica as early as 1000 BCE, and though most of the great lakes that once housed the heart of Aztec civilization were drained long ago, a few chinampas still feed the people of Mexico City after hundreds of years. While there are about 5,000 acres of extant chinampas, only about 2.5 percent of those are still used for agriculture, and the chinamperos that farm them employ both traditional and modern techniques. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! Besides their cultural, agricultural, and social value, the chinampas also represent the last natural haven for axolotls in the wild. Named in Nahuatl, like the irrigated land itself, after atl (\"water\") and the Aztec god Xolotl, axolotls are critically endangered amphibians whose unique regenerative capabilities   they can regrow limbs, eyes, and portions of their brains   make them an active subject of medical research. They were well known to the Aztecs and seem to have thrived in the basin of Mexico before the conquest, despite being a particularly esteemed part of the Aztec diet, described in the Florentine Codex as \"a meal fit for lords.\" (Book 11, folio 68r, translated by Anderson & Dibble). Axolotl Unknown Artist (CC BY-NC-ND) Today, scientists estimate that there are about 50 to 1,000 individuals left in the wild, and the combination of urban expansion and the decline of the cultivation of chinampas for agriculture has drastically reduced their habitat. The infrastructure of the floating farms, particularly the small canals that branch from larger waterways, provide axolotls with refuge from the invasive carp and tilapia, introduced to the ecosystem in the 1960s, that compete with them for food resources and prey on their young. The ecosystemic relationship between these unique amphibians and Mexico's farm-islands is enshrined on the 2021 50 peso note, which depicts an axolotl suspended in rippling canal waters, surrounded by crop-filled chinampas, and fenced in by the willows and reeds that form the salamander's natural habitat. In the background, a corn plant rendered in ethereal gold rises like the sun, and the text commemorates the environment of Xochimilco in its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Invaluable to the axolotls, modern chinampas also benefit local human populations by providing ecosystemic services, including water filtration, microclimate regulation, increased agro- and biodiversity, regulation of water levels, and the capture and sequestration of greenhouse gases. But the mere presence of chinampas cannot provide these services without care and maintenance. A number of agencies and organizations are actively pursuing conservation efforts to preserve and revitalize the chinampas of the basin of Mexico, but the trends are not promising. Even with ambitious local initiatives, the outlook is alarming. A projection for the year 2057 assumes that in Xochimilco, without a concerted effort from the involved players (particularly farmers and local government), most current chinampa land will be converted to housing. (Ebel 2019) Now, as in the time of the Aztecs, caring for and cultivating chinampas is a labor-intensive process. Today, a few people safeguard centuries-old farming techniques, and relatively few strive to sustain the whole system of chinampa agriculture from what would seem to be its inevitable decay. In 2022, researchers estimated that 90 percent of chinampas in Xochimilco and the surrounding area had been abandoned, and while the pandemic stoked some interest in the efforts to revitalize chinampas and further support chinamperos, Alejandra Borunda, writing for National Geographic magazine, noted that chinampas represent \"1,000 years of history, still alive for now.\" (Borunda 2022).",

        "title": "Potsdam Conference: When the WWII Allies Declared Japan Must Surrender",
        "content": "Attlee, Truman & Stalin, Potsdam, 1945 Unknown Photographer (Public Domain) The Potsdam Conference, held from 17 July to 2 August 1945 in Potsdam in eastern Germany, decided how the Allies would deal with a defeated Germany and how they could best conduct the ongoing campaign against Japan as the Second World War (1939-45) drew to a close. With victory in Europe achieved, US President Harry S. Truman, UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and then his successor, Clement Attlee, and the Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin issued a surrender ultimatum to Japan, known as the Potsdam Declaration. The ultimatum was ignored until US aircraft dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan surrendered on 14 August. Agreement at Yalta In February 1945, as victory seemed imminent for the Allies in the Second World War, the leaders of 'the Big Three' met at Yalta in the Crimea: President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and the Russian Premier Joseph Stalin. On the discussion table were such topics as how to deal with a defeated Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, and how to set up the United Nations, successor to the League of Nations. Poland's borders were to be shifted westwards, giving the USSR the eastern slice while acquiring a new western slice from Germany. It was agreed in principle to allow democratic elections in countries Nazi Germany had occupied. This sentiment was expressed in the Declaration on Liberated Europe. Remove Ads  Germany and Austria, in contrast, were to be divided into four zones of occupation (US, French, British, and Russian) with a joint military government established in each, the Allied Control Council in Germany and the Inter-Allied Council in Austria. Berlin and Vienna were similarly divided into zones of control. In addition, it was decided that each power had the right to conduct war crimes trials within its zone of occupation. Including France as an occupying power of Germany and Austria was a Western 'victory' at Yalta, as was the decision to allow France a permanent seat on the UN's governing Security Council. Another major agreement at Yalta concerned the still ongoing fighting with Japan. In return for Russia's entering the war against Japan, certain Soviet demands would be met. These demands included control of the Kuril (aka Kurile) Islands, the southern part of Sakhalin Island (both of these are in the Sea of Okhotsk and had been occupied by Japan), and retaining the status quo regarding Mongolia, which had been a Russian client state since 1924. There were many issues still unresolved, and so the 'Big Three' planned to meet again in July, this time at Potsdam, in Germany, an area then under Soviet military control. Remove Ads  Churchill, Roosevelt, & Stalin in Yalta, 1945 Imperial War Musuems (CC BY-NC-SA) Potsdam & New Faces The Potsdam Conference was held at Schloss Cecilienhof, not an imposing castle but more of a comfortable mansion set in a grand park outside Berlin. The meeting at Potsdam was given the code name Terminal. As at Yalta, the leaders of Great Britain, the USA, and the USSR still considered themselves the legitimate decision-makers for the fate of other nations largely because of the size of the armies they commanded and their successes on the battlefield, at sea, and in the air. Roosevelt had died since Yalta, and Churchill lost the general election in the middle of the conference (the results were announced on 26 July). Consequently, the new leaders were President Harry S. Truman and, from 28 July, Prime Minister Clement Attlee (who had previously been attending the conference as Churchill's deputy). THE LEADERS AT POTSDAM DISAGREED ON MANY KEY ISSUES & FREQUENTLY POSTPONED DECISIONS TO A FUTURE CONFERENCE OF FOREIGN MINISTERS. Stalin, then, had the advantage of experience, and, further, he was, according to Anthony Eden, the former British foreign minister, \"a cold, cool and a calculating negotiator who knew exactly what he wanted to get and went out to get it, never got excited, hardly ever raised his voice\" (Holmes, 541). Germany had surrendered in April 1945, and the USSR's Red Army had occupied Berlin. As the Imperial War Museum notes, Stalin was determined to get the best possible deal from his two counterparts at Potsdam: \"When asked if he felt great satisfaction at being in Berlin, Stalin replied 'Tsar Alexander got to Paris'\". Truman, after his first face-to-face meeting with Stalin and a lunch of liver, bacon, and Californian wine, wrote in his diary that the Russian leader was \"smart as hell\" (Moskin, 203). Clearly, the negotiations on what the post-war world would look like were going to be tough. Remove Ads  Germany's Punishment The attempt to reach an agreement on the war reparations Germany should pay to the victors was not successful. Stalin was determined to squeeze the maximum possible from Germany to help pay for the tremendous damage inflicted on the USSR. Truman, on the other hand, was wary that if the terms were too harsh, they might provoke a lasting hatred of the victors, such as had been seen in Germany after the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, which formally concluded the First World War. There were some points of agreement regarding Germany at Potsdam. Germany's military industry was to be dismantled. Nazi race laws like the Nuremberg Laws would be repealed, and there was to be a systematic denazification of the judicial and education systems. Potsdam Conference Delegates Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Redrawing Europe One point of discussion was the 'Poland Problem'. At Yalta, everyone had agreed there should be free elections in Poland, but Stalin had already interfered to make sure there was a pro-Soviet government installed there. Stalin was determined that Poland would be a huge buffer zone that would protect Russia from any future attack from Western Europe. The USA and Britain had, nevertheless, recognised Poland's new 'Provisional Government of National Unity' on 5 July. The reality was that the USSR's armed forces already had possession of the territory in question. The make-up of the new governments in Bulgaria and Greece was likewise disputed, with the Americans and British wanting free elections, but Stalin wanted the placement of Communists within these governments, no matter what, just as had already been done in Romania. It was decided at Potsdam that a Council of Foreign Ministers would be formed to define the new borders within Europe and decide how to carve up the various colonies of the war's losing powers. This was, in effect, a postponement of several issues where no agreement could be reached; there were many. The Council was not held until February 1947. By postponing the more prickly problems, the three leaders were at least able to press on with their quasi-cordial discussions. One issue settled at Potsdam was the decision to continue the Lend-Lease programme (material and financial aid from the USA to its Allies) to British occupation troops in Europe. Remove Ads  Achieving Victory against Japan The most important point of discussion at Potsdam was the peace terms regarding Japan. The United States had already developed the atomic bomb, a terrifying new weapon whose power was so great it was not fully understood. Indeed, Truman had delayed the Potsdam Conference in order for the first atomic bomb test to be completed in New Mexico on 16 July. Truman, then, knew by the time he arrived at Potsdam that he held in his hands the means to end the war almost immediately. The US Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, noted that news of the successful test had the following effect on Truman: \"The President was tremendously pepped up by it he said it gave him an entirely new feeling of confidence\" (Liddell Hart, 438). Leaders & Foreign Ministers at the Potsdam Conference Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) What has become known as the Potsdam Declaration was made on 27 July. The main message of the declaration was that Japan should immediately offer an unconditional surrender or else face complete destruction. The declaration was approved by both the British and Chinese governments. The declaration made no mention of the Japanese Emperor, and the Japanese government took this to mean he would not be obliged to abdicate. Japan was still fighting to hold on to each and every island and causing heavy casualties amongst the US forces. The Japanese military government ignored the declaration, despite having already made secret overtures to the government of the USSR that it was willing to consider a surrender. Inside the Japanese cabinet, it was felt that there was still some room for negotiation despite the stark terms of the declaration; certainly, they felt they had some time to further consider the ultimatum. The Japanese military government still hoped that a negotiated surrender might preserve it some vestige of power. The Potsdam Declaration, however, clearly stated this would not be tolerated and called for the removal of \"the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest\" (Dear, 864). This might or might not include the emperor. Further, the Japanese military must be disarmed, the state of Japan would henceforth be made up of only its four main islands, and war crimes trials would be conducted. The Allies hoped to foster a free and democratic Japan, where there was freedom of speech and religion and a respect for human rights. With victory in the war already assured, Truman was concerned with the supremacy of the United States in the post-war world. Without a surrender, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff expected continued and desperate resistance from the Japanese military, which still possessed some 2 million soldiers, and that, as a consequence, the war could not be won before the winter of 1946. It was estimated that victory using conventional arms would result in at least 200,000 US casualties, perhaps five times more. Further, if the USSR entered the war against Japan, as was promised and expected, that state might then make territorial claims in East Asia. The USSR, by actively helping in the defeat of Japan, would also strengthen its position in a divided Europe. Truman felt that \"only an actual atomic raid would convince Stalin of the irresistible force behind America's diplomacy\" (Liddell Hart, 438). Truman had rather vaguely informed Stalin on 24 July about the bomb (information Soviet spies had already passed on to Stalin). Truman declared that the United States had a weapon of unusual power and that he was prepared to use it against Japan. Stalin replied that this intention was a good idea. With victory in the war already assured, Truman was concerned with the supremacy of the United States in the post-war world just as much as he was with defeating Japan as quickly as possible. It is also true that the Manhattan Project to develop the bomb had cost $2 billion. To many involved in the atomic programme, it seemed unthinkable not to use the bomb now that it was ready. Remove Ads  With no response to the Potsdam Declaration, the United States government, with the formal approval of the British government, decided to drop a single atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August and another bomb on Nagasaki on 9 August. The bombs were dropped by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress planes Enola Gay and Bockscar. Over 200,000 people were killed in the attacks. On 10 August, the USSR's Red Army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria. The emperor of Japan, Hirohito, announced his country's surrender on 14 August. Truman responded to the surrender later that same day by declaring to reporters in a press conference: \"I deem this reply a full acceptance of the Potsdam declaration which specifies the unconditional surrender of Japan. In the reply there is no qualification\" (Moskin, 319). The Allies had won WWII. Hiroshima after the Atomic Bomb Attack Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The Cold War Potsdam, like the Yalta Conference, proved to be something of a disappointment for the West. At Potsdam, \"agreements with Moscow were more the exception than the rule\" (Dear, 878). Truman wrote to his mother near the conference's end: \"You never saw such pigheaded people as are the Russians. I hope I never have to hold another conference with them\" (Dear, 878). There was certainly a general feeling in the United States that as the USSR increasingly defaulted on the few commitments it had made at Yalta and Potsdam, the Americans had, in effect, \"won the war but lost the peace\" (Liddell Hart, 435). It was felt by many in the West that their leaders had negotiated away control of Eastern Europe to the USSR and permitted a Soviet presence in East Asia, which could be used as a platform for further expansion of Soviet influence in that part of the world. For this reason, the United States kept occupying troops in Japan until 1952. Emperor Hirohito was permitted to keep his position, but after renouncing his divinity as claimed by the Shinto religion, his role was redefined as a constitutional monarch. Hirohito's efforts to curb the Japanese military and promote a surrender had saved him, although historians continue to dispute just how great those efforts had been in reality. There has also been much debate ever since 1945 about whether Russia's declaration of war on Japan just before the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had any influence on the Japanese government's decision to surrender, and so whether the USA's compromises concerning Asia at Yalta and Potsdam had been, in the end, strictly necessary. Between the USA and USSR and their respective allies, there developed serious suspicions as to everyone's foreign policy aims. So the Cold War began, a decline in US-Soviet relations, which saw a prolonged period of international tensions and proxy wars throughout the second half of the 20th century.",

And yet, prior to his arrival in Texas, it is hard to imagine a less-likely hero than William Barret Travis. Early Life The family name was originally Travers and they established themselves at the Jamestown Colony of Virginia in 1627. Berwick Travers, Travis  grandfather, later moved to the region that would become South Carolina, married Ann Smallwood, and had seven children, among them Mark and Alexander. The spelling of the family name changed from Travers to Travis and the name  Berwick  became  Barret.  William Barret Travis was born 1 August (some sources give 9 August) 1809, the son of Mark Travis and Jemima Stallworth, one of ten children. Remove Ads  Travis started a newspaper, the Claiborne Herald. Mark was a prosperous farmer and Alexander a popular preacher. In 1817, Alexander moved to Alabama and Mark soon followed with his family. William, after learning the basics at public school, continued his education at the Sparta Academy where Alexander served as superintendent. Travis was a bright student, mastering the curriculum of Greek, Latin, French, philosophy, rhetoric, geography, history, and mathematics (Davis, 193). On graduating, Alexander enrolled him at another academy in Claiborne and, when he graduated at the age of 18, he became an instructor there. William B. Travis Wiley Martin (Public Domain) He understood, however, that teaching would not provide him with the income for the life he imagined for himself. Travis apprenticed himself to the attorney James Dellet and applied himself to learning law as he had his earlier studies. At the same time, he started a newspaper, the Claiborne Herald, which he ran entirely himself, writing the articles, setting the type, and selling subscriptions.

Travis had blue eyes, light, reddish-brown hair, and what one acquaintance described as  a fine Saxon face.  At nineteen years old, he had matured into a big-boned man who stood about five feet, ten inches tall. (146) At first, the couple seem to have been very happy together. Their first child, Charles Edward Travis, was born 8 August 1829, the Herald was making some money, and he was working well with Dellet. This all changed as Travis began to struggle to provide for his family, juggling his time between his law practice, the paper, his enlistment in the Alabama militia, duties at the Masonic Lodge, and his young wife and son. Still, by the time he was 20, he was a lawyer, publisher, teacher, and writer, well-respected by his community, and backed by the powerful and popular Dellet. Home of William B. Travis Jeff Reed (CC BY-SA) No matter how hard he tried, however, he could not make ends meet. He borrowed money from almost everyone he knew   his wife s brother and Dellet included   and began gambling hoping to  hit it big  to be able to pay them all back and still maintain his family and lifestyle. Gambling only added to his debt   which was around $800 (roughly $20,000 today) - and, in 1831, Dellet and the others filed suit against him. The court found against Travis and a warrant was issued for his arrest in March 1831. Remove Ads  Life with Rosanna had become increasingly difficult as he failed to provide for her and their son and, by this time, she was expecting another child. His newspaper had failed, his law practice was nearly non-existent, and now he was facing prison. He had heard of Texas as a land of new beginnings - and few lawyers - and so, telling Rosanna he would go make money there and then come back for her and square all debts, he left Claiborne   and would never return. Anglo-Americans in Texas 1823-1830 Mexico had won independence from Spain in 1821 and, to increase its tax base   as well as create a buffer between southern Mexico and Native American territory   invited Anglo-Americans to settle in the district of Coahuila y Tejas (Texas). Stephen F. Austin, like his father before him, became an empresario, selling lands to Anglo-American immigrants. Austin s initial land grants were approved by the Mexican government in 1823, bringing 300 families from the United States, many of them arriving with their slaves. The first sign of friction between Anglo-American immigrants and the Mexican authorities was the Fredonian Rebellion of 21 December 1826 to 31 January 1827 in which Anglo-American settlers under the empresario Haden Edwards declared themselves the independent Republic of Fredonia in the region near Nacogdoches. This revolt was not supported by Austin or any others outside of Edwards  settlement and was swiftly crushed by the Mexican army. Contrary to the claims of some historians, this was not the beginning of the Texas Revolution   but it certainly encouraged some, who would eventually form the War Party, to consider establishing an independent Republic of Texas. Remove Ads  In 1829, Mexico abolished slavery but, when the Anglo-Americans objected, concessions were made so that they could keep their slaves. In 1830, however, President Anastasio Bustamante rescinded these concessions through the Laws of April 6, 1830, which also banned further immigration from the USA and raised taxes on those already in Texas. The Anglo-American settlers, now calling themselves Texians, strongly objected to these laws and tensions rose between them and the regional Mexican authorities. Travis was granted land and established his law practice at Anahuac. This situation created two  parties  among the Anglo colonists   although these were never official parties, simply factions of the population   the Peace Party, which sought to negotiate better terms and laws with Mexico, and the War Party, which advocated for armed rebellion and the establishment of an independent nation. Anahuac Disturbances Into the midst of all of this rode Travis, arriving in San Felipe in 1831 as an illegal immigrant. He was granted land by Austin and established his law practice at Anahuac. On legal forms he claimed he was single or, at other times, a widower. Unlike other immigrants, Travis learned Spanish, hoping this would help him acquire more clients. He also joined the local militia and, quickly, became a prominent supporter of the War Party. His first clash with Mexican authorities came in the form of Juan Davis Bradburn, who had been born John Davis Bradburn in Virginia in 1787. He had fought in the War of 1812 at the Battle of New Orleans before enlisting in the Mexican army fighting for independence from Spain. In 1830, he was given command of the post at Anahuac. Frank W. Johnson Unknown Photographer (Public Domain) The Texians at first welcomed Bradburn, thinking that, as a fellow American, he would allow them greater freedoms. They had no idea who they were dealing with. Bradburn had fully embraced his adopted country and was intent on upholding its laws. He could not force the Texians to free their slaves without risking an uprising, but he certainly was not going to help anyone keep them. In August 1831, two slaves (sometimes given as three) escaped from a William M. Logan of Louisiana and fled to Texas. Bradburn took them in, hiring them to work on his estate. In May 1832, Logan hired Travis to get them back and, when Bradburn refused, Travis sent an anonymous letter warning him that Logan and 100 armed men would soon arrive to take the slaves by force if they were not soon surrendered. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! Bradburn saw through the ploy and had Travis arrested for threatening a Mexican official. When Travis  law partner, Patrick C. Jack, stormed into Bradburn s office to protest, he was also arrested, as were a handful of other Texians Bradburn accused of theft. Bradburn wanted his prisoners transferred to Matamoros to be tried on charges of treason and this roused the War Party of Anahuac under Frank W. Johnson who, with his militia of around 150 men, took over the buildings around Bradburn s post, demanding he surrender Travis and the others. Johnson had captured 19 Mexican cavalry officers and negotiated an exchange while, at around this same time, others of the militia, under the command of John Austin (no relation to Stephen F. Austin), left to bring a cannon and reinforcements back from Brazoria to force Bradburn to surrender his post. While Austin was en route (and, incidentally, fighting the Battle of Fort Velasco), Bradburn agreed to Johnson s terms and the prisoners were freed. Bradburn was replaced and fled to Louisiana   and Travis became a hero of the War Party. He left Anahuac for San Felipe, where his law practice boomed, and he became a celebrity. In July 1835, he returned to Anahuac and assumed an even larger role when, commanding a force of 25 men, he captured and disarmed 40 Mexican troops who had arrested two Texians for their protests against taxes. General Martin Perfecto de Cos, the brother-in-law of General (and president) Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, ordered Travis  arrest but the Texians would not surrender him. Travis was given a commission of Lieutenant Colonel of Cavalry and then left Anahuac to return to San Felipe. Mexican General Mart n Perfecto de Cos Unknown (Public Domain) Prosperity & Romance Travis did well in San Felipe. Scholar William C. Davis writes: With Travis  growing prosperity came a steady maturing in his attitude toward debt  He engaged a friend who was traveling back to Alabama to go to Claiborne and redeem all those outstanding notes, a step on the road to regaining his reputation. (281) Since his arrival in Texas, he had sent his wife nothing by way of support, relying on her family, who had money, to care for her and his two children, Charles Edward and Susan (born in 1831 after his departure). Upon hearing that Travis had cleared all his debts in Claiborne, but had not sent her anything, Rosanna filed for divorce on grounds of abandonment, which became official in January 1836. Remove Ads  Travis, meanwhile, was making more money than ever before, purchasing and hiring out slaves, among them, Joe (the only male survivor of the Alamo). He also enjoyed the life of a bachelor in San Felipe. Beginning in 1833, Travis visited the crossing at Mill Creek where there was a popular inn operated by one John Cummings. His sister, Rebecca, attracted Travis  attention. He paid for a Christmas party held there in 1833, began a courtship, and, by February 1834, had told Rebecca about Rosanna and how he was not yet divorced but, as soon as that could be resolved, they could be married. She tentatively agreed but demanded he give up gambling, which he did. To seal their agreement, she gave him a ring which he would later give to the infant Angelina Dickinson at the Alamo and, today, can be seen in one of the exhibits in the Alamo chapel. Interior of the Alamo Chapel, 2025 Gatorfan252525 (CC BY-SA) Travis & the Texas Revolution Throughout 1834 and into 1835, Travis became increasingly involved with the War Party seeking independence from Mexico. By 1835, Santa Anna had abolished the Federalist Constitution of 1824   which had granted Anglo-Americans a voice in government, as well as other freedoms   and the War Party characterized the new Mexican government as an oppressive dictatorship. In July 1835, as noted, he returned to Anahuac to free the two Texians the War Party claimed had been unjustly arrested. He missed out on the Battle of Gonzales on 2 October of 1835, because of a bad cold and sore throat, but commanded a cavalry unit as a scout during the Siege of Bexar (12 October to 11 December 1835). The siege ended with the surrender of General Cos, who had fortified the old mission-become-fort, the Alamo and, with Cos  retreat from Texas, many felt the war was over and independence had been won. There were many others who did not believe this, however, and among them were Colonel James C. Neill, General Sam Houston, James  Jim  Bowie, and Travis. Neill had taken control of the Alamo in December 1835, and, in January 1836, Travis was sent to reinforce him, arriving at the Alamo in early February 1836. The Battle of the Alamo, 1836 Nicha Sursock (CC BY-NC-SA) Command of the Alamo Jim Bowie had gotten there earlier with orders from Houston to remove all ordnance and destroy the fort. He and Neill, however, felt the Alamo should be held against what they saw as the inevitable return of Santa Anna s forces. On 11 February, Neill left to tend to personal business and Travis assumed his command. This led to a dispute between Bowie and Travis as to who should command the garrison overall. Remove Ads  A compromise was reached in which Travis would command his men and Neill s and Bowie would have authority over his own. Any decisions affecting the entire garrison would be made together. Travis was certain that Santa Anna, if he did come, would not arrive before mid-to-late March and sent out letters asking for reinforcements   especially to Colonel James W. Fannin at Goliad   while he supervised repairs to the Alamo s walls. Reports that Santa Anna was marching toward the Alamo began as early as 14 February, but these were dismissed as rumors and gossip. On 23 February, Santa Anna marched into San Antonio de Bexar   and the siege of the Alamo began. On the 24th, Bowie fell ill, and Travis assumed sole command of the garrison. Plaque of William Barret Travis's Letter from the Alamo Betsy Mark (CC BY-NC-SA) Siege & Battle of the Alamo On 24 February, Travis sent the most famous letter of his many asking for help   the so-called Travis Letter   also known as the  Victory or Death  Letter: To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World: Fellow citizens and compatriots -I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism and everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country. VICTORY or DEATH. William Barret Travis Lt. Col. Comdt. P.S. The Lord is on our side. When the enemy appeared in sight, we had not three bushels of corn. We have since found in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels and got into the walls 20 or 30 head of Beeves. Travis (Groneman, 4) This letter, hailed as  the most patriotic , has become famous world-wide and would later encourage others to flock to the cause of Texas liberty, but, sadly for Travis, did little to bring reinforcements to the Alamo. On 1 March, 32 volunteers from Gonzales arrived but Fannin failed spectacularly in his paltry attempt to lend aid and wound up dying in the Goliad Massacre on 27 March 1836. Sam Houston dismissed the letter as a literary exaggeration and refused to believe Santa Anna was even in Texas until 11 March when Susanna Dickinson (with her infant daughter Angelina) and Travis' slave, Joe, brought word to Gonzales that the Alamo had fallen. According to Alamo lore, on 5 March, Travis drew a line in the sand of the Alamo courtyard, informing the garrison that their situation was hopeless without reinforcement, and asking anyone who would stand with him to step across - any others were free to leave. Only one man, Louis Moses Rose, is said to have left. Travis held the Alamo against overwhelming odds for 13 days and was among the first to die in the assault of 6 March. All the defenders of the Alamo were killed, including David  Davy  Crockett of Tennessee. William B. Travis Plaque Betsy Mark (CC BY-NC-SA) Conclusion Possibly before, but certainly after his arrival in Texas, Travis came to see himself as a great romantic hero, along the lines of King Arthur, fighting for the cause of right against what he saw as the forces of darkness. Although his early life would hardly suggest a future as a great hero of Texas liberty and personal sacrifice, through his self-image, he became what he believed himself to be, even dying for it. Travis features prominently on the Alamo cenotaph, commissioned in 1936 for the Texan Centennial, and has been portrayed in many TV shows, documentaries, and movies, notably by Lawrence Harvey in The Alamo (1960), by Alec Baldwin in The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory (1987), and by Patrick Wilson in The Alamo (2004)   considered the most accurate film version of the siege, battle, and Travis himself. Remove Ads  Any honest appraisal of William Barret Travis today must acknowledge his abandonment of his family and role as a slave owner but, at the same time, should give credit to the man who, like many Americans, reinvented and redeemed himself. Travis now has schools, streets, and monuments named in his honor and, in death, achieved all he wanted in life: to become a great man worthy of respect - a hero.",

        "content": "Raid on Deerfield, 1704 Walter Henry Lippincott (Public Domain) Queen Anne s War (1702-1713) was the second major colonial conflict in North America, fought between the colonies of England   Great Britain after 1707   and those of France and Spain, each side aided by their respective Native American allies. An extension of a larger European conflict, the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), Queen Anne s War had its own unique origins, stemming from the tempestuous politics of Colonial America. The war officially began when Anne, Queen of Great Britain (reign 1702-1714)   after whom the North American conflict was named   declared war on France and Spain, in response to a dispute over who would inherit the Spanish throne. This dynastic war, though of little significance to the colonists on the North American frontier, would nevertheless reignite tensions that had been simmering since the last colonial war. New France, for instance, was quarreling with its English rivals over control of the lucrative fur trade as well as over a border dispute between its colony of Acadia and the New England territory of Maine. The indigenous Wabanaki Confederacy had a generations-long feud with the New England colonies as well, stretching back to the violence of King Philip s War (1675-1678). And, in the south, the English Province of Carolina contended with its own rival, Spanish Florida, which sometimes authorized Native American raids into Carolinian territory. So, when word of Queen Anne s declaration of war reached American shores, the colonies and Native American nations readily engaged in a ferocious war of their own characterized by bloody cycles of retaliatory raids and deadly frontier skirmishes. Remove Ads  New France had long been struggling with its English rivals over control of the lucrative beaver pelt trade. Background At the turn of the 18th century, Colonial America was a tinderbox. Decades of tensions, arising from issues such as border disputes, dishonored treaties, and the struggle over resources, had already led to the bloodletting of King William s War (1688-1697). However, this conflict, quite limited in scope, had achieved little besides the burning of frontier villages and the killing or kidnapping of their inhabitants, serving to heighten the animosity between the English colonies on one side, and New France on the other. One major point of contention was in the northeast, in modern-day Maine, which was claimed both by the French colony of Acadia (modern-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and the New England colonies. Maine had been the site of the most brutal fighting of the previous war, its settlements still scarred by the flames, the graves of the slain still fresh in its soil. New France had also long been struggling with its English rivals over control of the lucrative beaver pelt trade in the Great Lakes region. While the English enjoyed a numerical advantage over their French rivals   the population of the English colonies was approaching 200,000 by 1700, while New France had less than 20,000   the French had better leadership and more settlers with military experience, helping to even the odds. Anne, Queen of Great Britain Unknown Artist (Public Domain) Though the rivalry between these two European powers lay at the center of the political tensions, a few powerful Indigenous polities could not be ignored. One of these, the Wabanaki Confederacy, had been fighting against the New Englanders for decades; several times, the Wabanakis and the English had signed peace treaties, only for the English to later trample over these agreements and encroach further onto Wabanaki land. In response, the Wabanakis had aligned themselves closer with the French, intermarrying with French settlers and allowing Jesuit missionaries in their midst. During King William s War, it had been the Wabanakis who had conducted most of the raids on New England towns, striking terror and fear into the hearts of the English settlers. Another Native American polity was the Iroquois Confederacy, which had been allied with the English during King William s War only to find themselves abandoned at the end of it. When the English made peace with the French in 1697, they neglected to provide for their Iroquois allies. Thus, the Iroquois were left to keep fighting the French by themselves. Many of their villages were burned and people killed by the vengeful French, before the Iroquois were able to finalize their own peace treaty in 1701. The Iroquois, understandably, accused the English of abandoning them, and were unlikely to want to help should a second colonial war break out. Remove Ads  A cycle of retaliatory raids continued between the Spanish in Florida and the English in Carolina. Such a war, it would turn out, was not long in coming. But the spark that would ignite this North American tinderbox would come from thousands of miles away, over in Europe. In November 1700, King Charles II of Spain died without children. The vacant Spanish throne was duly claimed by a member of the French Bourbon dynasty, a grandson of King Louis XIV, a move that alarmed some of the other European nations who feared that a union between France and Spain would upset the delicate balance of power. These nations, a powerful coalition including England, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Dutch Republic, instead favored a candidate from the Habsburg dynasty to succeed to the throne of Spain. This dispute ultimately led to the War of the Spanish Succession, as the pro-Bourbon and pro-Habsburg alliances vied for control of the Spanish Empire. At first, England and France tried to make a deal to keep their overseas colonies neutral in the struggle. But, by the time word reached Colonial America that war had broken out in Europe in 1702, there was nothing that could put the genie back in the bottle. A new colonial war had begun. War in the South Unlike King William s War, which had been mostly confined to New England and Canada, this new conflict would be fought on a wider scale, with the first salvoes of fighting fired off in the South. By this point, both the English and French colonists were racing to secure trade access to the Mississippi River; the Province of Carolina, then the southernmost of the English colonies, was so far winning this race, having established a lucrative trade network touching the banks of the Mississippi. Pierre Le Moyne d Iberville, a French explorer and trader, was eager to break up this Carolinian trade network. At the start of the war, he went to Spanish Florida and urged the pro-Bourbon commander of Pensacola to arm the local Apalachee natives and send them into Carolina to wreak havoc. This was done and, in August 1702, a Spanish-led Apalachee war party began raiding the trading posts of the Carolina backcountry. The English quickly put together an army of their own to meet this threat and fought the Spanish and Apalachee at the Battle of Flint River in October 1702. The battle was a resounding English victory; 500 Apalachee warriors were killed or wounded, the rest forced back into Spanish Florida. Remove Ads  Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville Unknown Artist (Public Domain) James Moore, the governor of Carolina, was not about to let them get away so easily. That autumn, he raised a force of 500 English militia and 300 Indigenous allies   mostly Muscogee   and personally led them in an invasion of Spanish Florida. On 10 November 1702, Moore laid siege to St. Augustine, burning the outlying Spanish communities. For over a month, the English continued to lay siege, but their guns had little impact on the strong walls of St. Augustine. When a Spanish relief force arrived from Havana on 29 December, Moore lifted the siege and pulled his forces back to Charles Town (Charleston). The following year, he led 50 English militia and over 1,000 allied Muscogee warriors back into Florida, burning the Spanish missions to the west of St. Augustine. This campaign of retribution climaxed in January 1704, when Moore s men conducted a series of raids against the Apalachee villages. Moore himself would later claim to have killed over 1,100 Apalachee men, women, and children, and to have forced another 4,300 into slavery. Many of the survivors were forced onto reservations along the Savannah River. In 1706, the French and Spanish retaliated with a joint attack on Charles Town, although this ultimately failed. The next several years saw this cycle of retaliatory raids continue between the Spanish in Florida and the English in Carolina. War in New England To the north, the series of bloody border raids that had characterized King William s War resumed with a new fury. In early 1703, a French-led force of 500 Wabanaki warriors moved down from Acadia and burned several English settlements in Maine including Wells and Falmouth (present-day Portland). English settlers who had survived the bloodshed of the previous decade must have looked on in horror as their rebuilt settlements went up in flames, their family members slaughtered or carried off to Canada as captives. Indeed, during the French and Wabanaki raids of 1703, over 300 English settlers were either killed or taken captive. But the most infamous raid of the war would occur the following year, when a French military officer, Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville, led a band of 250 Abenaki and Caughnawaga warriors to the sleepy town of Deerfield, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. At 4 am on 29 February 1704, they silently crept across the outlying snow-covered fields, entered the undefended town, and proceeded to rip the English colonists from their beds. 47 men, women, and children were killed outright, while 112 others were rounded up and taken as captives. These captives were dragged over 300 miles to the French settlement of Montreal, some of them dying enroute. The survivors were either assimilated into the Abenaki tribe   a custom practiced by some Native American nations to replace losses to their communities   or ransomed back to Massachusetts. In 1704, the English retaliated to these raids by sending an expedition of their own into Acadia. This was led by Colonel Benjamin Church, a renowned Indigenous fighter who had won fame in the bloody battles of both King Philip s War and King William s War. Church raided several Acadian settlements, repaying the French and Wabanakis with fire and blood. Some accounts claim that Church made an attempt to attack Port Royal, the capital of Acadia, but found it too well defended and gave up, returning to New Hampshire. In 1705, the French and their Wabanaki allies made new raids into northern Massachusetts. They were quick with their bloody business and were oftentimes long gone before the local militia could mount any kind of defense. Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley soon realized that the best way to defend his colony was to launch an offensive into New France. In May 1707, he organized a 1,600-man expedition to seize Port Royal. Like Church before them, these New England troops found Port Royal s defenses too strong and were repulsed after a brief siege. By now, it had become clear that the New Englanders needed help if they were to turn the tide against the French and Wabanaki raids. Such help would have to come from the dormant Iroquois Confederacy, still neutral and licking its wounds from the last war. Remove Ads  English Raid on Grand Pre, 1704 Hezekiah Butterwort (Public Domain) But indeed, most of the Iroquois were in no mood to help. Except for the Mohawks, the most Anglophile of the confederacy s Five Nations, the Iroquois were mistrustful of the English, remembering how they had betrayed them at the end of the last war. In fact, some of the Iroquois, particularly the Onondaga and upper Seneca nations, were beginning to favor forging stronger ties with the French, and had allowed French Jesuit missionaries amongst their communities. Alarmed, the Province of New York sent its Indian commissioner, Peter Schuyler, to remind the Iroquois of their old alliance with the English, known as the Covenant Chain, and to draw them back into the fold. After multiple meetings, the Iroquois still refused to offer full military support, though they soothed Schuyler with vague promises of help. In the meantime, some Iroquois provided the French with word of Schuyler s attempts to invoke the Covenant Chain as well as the English military plans he had shown them   by playing both sides, the Iroquois proved once again that they were shrewd political operators, ensuring their own survival by making sure that both of the European powers relied on them. But while Schuyler attempted to get help from the Iroquois, other colonials were looking for support from across the ocean, in the person of Queen Anne herself. Attacks on Canada In 1708, Samuel Vetch, a Scottish merchant with colonial ties, planned a two-pronged offensive to capture Quebec, the capital of New France. Time and again, Vetch had witnessed the French grant sanctuary to the Wabanakis after their destructive raids on English settlements, leading him to the conclusion that the only way to ensure New England s security was to expel the French from North America altogether. To this end, he travelled to London and appealed to Queen Anne herself for military support from Great Britain (England was merged into Great Britain with the Acts of Union in 1707). The queen approved of Vetch s  grand enterprise  and offered to provide ships for his campaign. The next year, Vetch and his collaborator, colonial official Francis Nicholson, put together their expedition: one army of 1,500 men would march overland to capture Montreal while another 1,000-man force would sail to Quebec aboard British ships. This ambitious campaign, however, had to be called off when the promised British ships never materialized; indeed, they had been rerouted for military operations off Portugal. Frustratingly, the North American theater had proved to be nothing more than a sideshow for the generals of Europe. The two men refused to give up. In early 1710, they returned to London, this time in the company of four Indigenous chiefs, three of whom were Iroquois from the pro-English Mohawk nation. The presence of these so-called  Four Mohawk Kings  caused a great sensation in London. The chiefs were carried through the streets in royal carriages, banqueted by the Board of Trade, and even treated to a performance of William Shakespeare's Macbeth where they were allowed to sit on stage. When the Indigenous chiefs were granted an audience with the queen, they asked for military assistance against the French, as well as Anglican missionaries to go amongst their villages and offset the influence of the Jesuits. This move, calculated by Nicholson and Vetch, made it difficult for the queen to refuse. So, in July 1710, Nicholson returned to Boston with 400 marines brought over from Britain. He recruited 1,500 militiamen from the colonies and, in late September, set sail aboard a fleet consisting of 36 transports and 5 British warships. The British and colonists arrived outside Port Royal and captured it on 13 October after a week-long siege. Nicholson s forces promptly occupied it and renamed it Annapolis Royal in honor of the queen. Remove Ads  Four Mohawk Kings Contingent Identity (CC BY-SA) Emboldened by this success, Nicholson returned to London in 1711 to ask for support for another offensive against Quebec. This was granted and, in June, a fleet of 15 ships-of-the-line arrived in Boston under Admiral Hovenden Walker, transporting 5,000 British soldiers. This was, up to that point, the largest military force that Britain had ever offered in support of its North American colonies. The expedition had to set off quickly   the then small town of Boston could barely afford to feed this influx of mouths   and sailed for Quebec at the end of July. But, as the fleet approached the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, it sailed into a thick fog. Several ships were wrecked on the rocky shores and sank, with as many as 700 soldiers drowning. After this calamity, Admiral Walker had no choice but to call off the expedition. Nicholson, meanwhile, was leading a concurrent overland expedition to capture Montreal which included some Iroquois scouts. However, once he learned of Walker s failure, he promptly called off his expedition and turned back to Albany, New York. Peace In 1712, an armistice was reached between Britain and France, and a final peace treaty was signed the following year. In the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Philip V   the Bourbon candidate   was recognized as king of Spain, in return for his renunciation of all claims to the French throne. But where Britain really gained the most was in North America; France ceded control of Acadia, Newfoundland, the Hudson Bay area, and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts to Britain. In return, the French kept control of  le-Royale (modern-day Cape Breton Island) and retained the right to fish off the coast of Newfoundland. The Treaty of Utrecht did not provide for the Wabanakis, who made a separate peace with the New England colonies in July 1713. In the ensuing Treaty of Portsmouth, the Wabanakis and New Englanders established a boundary at the Kennebec River   thereby resolving the long-running border dispute in Maine   and the Wabanakis allowed the colonists to establish trading posts in their territory. Thus, Queen Anne s War was over. Unlike King William s War, which had achieved nothing and restored the prewar status quo, Queen Anne s War ended in a British victory, shoring up the British presence in modern-day Canada at the expense of the French. Indeed, the French, wary of losing their remaining Canadian territories, spent the following years building a mighty fortress on Cape Breton Island that they named Louisbourg; this would serve as a major point of contention between the French and the British, raising tensions in the region. In the former French colony of Acadia   renamed Nova Scotia by the British   many Acadians refused to swear allegiance to the British Crown and left for other French controlled colonies. The Iroquois had retained their neutrality during the course of the war. However, in the Treaty of Utrecht, they had been recognized as British subjects, aligning them further with the British colonies, whether they wanted to or not. Though the colonial map of North America had changed, animosities between all the major players remained as strong as ever, leading to the third great colonial conflict King George s War (1744-1748).",

        "content": "French and Wabanakis Attack Schenectady, 1690 Unknown Artist (Public Domain) King William s War (1688-1697) was the first of four major colonial conflicts fought between England, France, and their respective Native American allies in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though the war had its own unique origins, it coincided with a larger European conflict   the Nine Years  War   marking the first time that Colonial America was swept up in the imperial struggles of the Old World. Though the war was named after King William III of England (reign 1689-1702), it had more to do with the political situation in North America than with the grand designs of European kings. Tensions between the New England colonies and the indigenous Wabanaki Confederacy remained high in the aftermath of King Philip s War (1675-1678). Mistrustful of the intentions of the English, the Wabanaki aligned themselves with New France, the other major colonial power in the region. The French, in turn, were concerned with protecting their lucrative fur trade from the machinations of the powerful Iroquois Confederacy, who were allied with the English in New York. Once word arrived from across the ocean that England and France were at war, the North American powder keg exploded; for the next several years, the French and Wabanaki launched several bloody raids against the English and Iroquois, who responded in kind. The backwoods bloodshed would continue until 1697, when the Treaty of Ryswick ended most of the fighting and restored the prewar borders. Tensions would continue to simmer until the outbreak of the next great colonial conflict, Queen Anne s War (1702-1713). Remove Ads  Background In the decade that followed the devastation of King Philip s War, an uneasy peace settled over New England. The peace, though fragile, was certainly welcome, since the war that preceded it had been bitter and hard-fought. The Wampanoag Confederacy, once the dominant power in the region, had attacked the New England colonies in a desperate bit to stop the white settlers from encroaching onto their lands. Thousands of men, women, and children had died in the struggle that followed, dozens of villages, both indigenous and English, razed to the ground. But now, Metacomet   the Wampanoag chieftain who had started the war, known to the English as  King Philip    was dead, felled by an assassin s bullet, his severed head adorning a pike at the entrance to Plymouth, Massachusetts, where it would molder for the next two decades. His followers, those who had not already been killed, were either rounded up and executed or sold into slavery, while the other Wampanoags were forced onto reservations and made to watch as the triumphant New Englanders gobbled up their ancestral lands. The balance of power in the northeast had forever shifted; the strength of the Wampanoag Confederacy had been broken, the hegemony of the English ascendent. The Wabanakis, cognizant of the way the English had treated the Wampanoags, remained wary. But no sooner had the bloodshed of King Philip s War given way to peace then Increase Mather, the preeminent minister in Boston, predicted the coming of another conflict:  There seems to be a dark cloud rising from the east in respect of Indians in those parts; yea, a cloud which streameth forth in blood  (quoted in Pulsipher, 588). Indeed, the Wampanoags had not been the only Native Americans contending with the English for control of the northeast. In the French colony of Acadia   roughly corresponding to the modern-day Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick   lived the Wabanaki people, or  people of the Dawnland . During King Philip s War, the Wabanakis had raided English settlements in New Hampshire and Maine, wreaking such havoc as to completely drive the terrified Englishmen away. In 1678, the war weary governments of New England signed a peace treaty with the Wabanakis. The Wabanakis would agree to let the English return to their abandoned settlements, and, in exchange, the English would recognize Wabanaki sovereignty and pay them an annual tribute in corn. For a while, this peace seemed to hold although the Wabanakis, cognizant of the way the English had treated the Wampanoags, remained wary. Remove Ads  Sir Edmund Andros Mary Beale (Public Domain) To better prepare themselves for the eventuality of an English betrayal, the five Wabanaki nations (Abenaki, Mi kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot) organized themselves into the Wabanaki Confederacy. They also pursued closer relations with New France, intermarrying with French settlers and allowing Jesuit missionaries into their midst. The French, of course, were the other dominant European presence in the region, vying with the English for control of the lucrative fur trade. Although the French were less permanently established in North America than their English rivals   in 1689, for instance, New France had a population of only 14,000, compared to the 154,000 people living in the English colonies   they were able to maintain their grip on the fur trade through a web of strong alliances with local Native American groups, like the Wabanaki. But in 1680, the string of alliances that upheld the French fur trade came under threat when the powerful Iroquois Confederacy attacked several of New France s indigenous allies in the Great Lakes region. The Iroquois had recently formed an alliance with the English government of New York, called the Covenant Chain, leading the French to suspect that they had acted with the blessing   if not by the direct instigation   of the English. In retaliation, the French raided several Iroquois villages in New York, thereby challenging both the Iroquois and the English. The stage was set for another conflict; the clouds of war, as foreseen by Increase Mather, looked quite dark indeed. In early 1689, monumental events in Europe would once again affect the destiny of the New World. First Blood In April 1688, amidst all this escalating violence, Sir Edmund Andros led an expedition to Saint-Castin s Trading House in Maine. Andros was the unpopular governor of the Dominion of New England, a short-lived conglomeration of the New England colonies under a single, royally appointed government. An authoritative man, Andros sought to flex his powers by resolving a border dispute between Maine and Acadia. He led his soldiers to Penobscot Bay where they plundered both the home and trading post of Baron Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin, a French military officer and trader who had set up shop on land claimed by Andros. Saint-Castin, who had married a Penobscot woman and had mixed-race sons by her, was well respected in the Wabanaki Confederacy; the attack on his property was viewed as an insult to the Wabanaki as a whole. Around the same time, 16 Wabanaki men were arrested in Maine on the orders of Governor Andros on the pretense that they had killed English cattle, and were sent to Boston for imprisonment. Wabanaki patience with their English neighbors had already been running thin   the New Englanders had slowly been violating the 1678 treaty by settling on Wabanaki lands and stopping payment of the corn tribute   but these two incidents were the final straw. Remove Ads  In August 1688, Saint-Castin led a party of Wabanaki warriors on raids against several English settlements in Maine. A few English settlers were killed in these scuffles, and several more were taken captive. When he learned of these raids, Governor Andros realized that he may have accidentally started a new Indian war and tried to deescalate, ordering the release of the 16 Wabanaki prisoners in Boston. But when Saint-Castin refused to release his own prisoners, Andros shifted tactics and led an army of 700 men into Maine in early November. By then, Saint-Castin and the Wabanakis had already withdrawn into Acadia, and the New Englanders accomplished little besides simply tramping around the wilderness. At the end of the year, Andros returned to Boston but left his troops behind in Maine to keep the peace, stationing them in several frontier posts. But, the following spring, news arrived from Europe that would change everything   the Glorious Revolution had broken out in England. King James II of England had been forced to abdicate, leading to the ascension of William of Orange and his wife Mary to the joint rule of the kingdom. The shockwaves of revolution reverberated throughout the colonies; Andros was overthrown by a mob in Boston, and the Dominion of New England dismantled. Because of the chaos, most of the English soldiers returned to Massachusetts, leaving Maine once again undefended. Benjamin Church, c. 1675 Unknown Artist (Public Domain) Three Raids In early 1689, monumental events in Europe would once again affect the destiny of the New World. The newly crowned William III of England joined together with Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, to form a  Grand Alliance  against the expansionist ambitions of King Louis XIV of France. In May, William and Leopold officially declared war on France, beginning a conflict that would become known as the Nine Years  War. Though the kings and generals of Europe hardly paid any thought to the backwoods of North America half a world away, this official declaration of war gave the colonies leave to attack one another with renewed vigor. News of the expanded European conflict had not yet reached the little settlement of Dover, New Hampshire, when, on the night of 27 June 1689, a pair of Wabanaki women arrived and asked for shelter. This was granted and, in the middle of the night, the women threw open the town gates to let in scores of Wabanaki warriors. 20 English settlers were massacred that night, including Major Richard Waldron, the town s leading citizen. During King Philip s War, Waldron had used trickery to capture hundreds of Wabanakis before selling them into slavery. Eager to repay this debt, the Wabanaki warriors now burst into his bedroom, clubbed him over the head, and dragged him into the next room where they tied him to a chair and tortured him to death. The Wabanakis then absconded from the ruined settlement with 29 English prisoners, who were sold into captivity in New France. In August 1689, Saint-Castin once again invaded Maine at the head of a Wabanaki war party, this time sharing command with the French missionary Father Louis-Pierre Thury. They surrounded the English fort at Pemaquid, capturing or killing any English settlers who failed to make it to the safety of the fort s palisades in time. The garrison held out for a day but, after sustaining heavy casualties, opted to surrender; Saint-Castin had both the fort and the nearby town burned to the ground. The raids on Dover and Pemaquid were a clear escalation of hostilities and, after the declaration of war in Europe became known, the English were eager to retaliate. A 1,500-man Iroquois war party was sent into New France to raid the settlement of Lachine, while Major Benjamin Church led 250 Massachusetts soldiers on an expedition to defend English settlers in Maine. Church held a fearsome reputation as an Indian fighter and, indeed, had led the party that had hunted down and killed Metacomet back in 1676. On 21 September 1689, Church would once again make a name for himself, when his men defended the English settlers at Falmouth (present-day Portland, Maine) against a larger Acadian and Wabanaki force. Church beat back the enemy at the cost of 21 casualties, saving the Falmouth settlers from likely slaughter. Remove Ads  Death of Major Richard Waldron Unknown Artist (Public Domain) Escalations In early 1690, the scale of the conflict expanded once again. The governor-general of New France, Louis de Baude, Comte de Frontenac, ordered several concurrent military expeditions against the English colonies. The first expedition, led by French officers and consisting of Wabanaki warriors, made its way to Schenectady, New York, on the night of 8 February 1690. Finding the town undefended, they attacked, massacring 60 residents (including 11 enslaved African Americans) and absconding with 27 captives. The second expedition, led by Saint-Castin, razed the town of Salmon Falls, on the border between New Hampshire and Maine, on 27 March, killing 34 English settlers. Saint-Castin s expedition then wound its way into Maine, falling upon the Falmouth settlement that Church had defended the year before. This time, there was no one to protect the English settlers; Saint-Castin butchered the men, took the women and children prisoner, and burned the settlement to the ground. Church learned of the attack too late and arrived at Falmouth with little to do but bury the dead. Frontenac s attacks did not long go unanswered. On 23 April 1690, seven English warships sailed out of Boston carrying 736 provincial militiamen under Sir William Phips, a Maine-borne treasure hunter who now sought the glory of a military victory. On 9 May, the New Englanders arrived outside Port Royal, the capital of Acadia, taking the 90-man French garrison by surprise. Realizing they could not withstand a siege, the French surrendered. Phips imprisoned the French soldiers and Acadian townspeople in the church before turning a blind eye as his soldiers plundered the town, on the pretext that the French had somehow violated the terms of surrender. Phips left soon after, but additional English warships returned to Port Royal the following month, leading to another round of burning and looting. In September, Church led a second expedition of 300 men into Acadia. He travelled up the Androscoggin River, raiding Wabanaki villages and butchering several of their men. After freeing five English captives from a Wabanaki wigwam, Church claimed victory and returned to New Hampshire. Count Frontenac with Indigenous Allies Charles William Jefferys (Public Domain) Emboldened by these successes, the English decided to launch full-scale invasions of New France. One expedition, under Fitz-John Winthrop, set out overland toward Montreal. However, disease, lack of provisions, and disagreements among officers forced this army to turn back before it reached its target. The second expedition, under Phips, targeted Quebec, capital of New France. In late August, Phips sailed out of Boston with 2,300 militiamen aboard 32 ships. But thanks to poor weather, he did not make it to Quebec until 16 October. Frontenac, appraised of Phips s coming, had had ample time to prepare, and had gathered 3,000 soldiers for the town s defense, including three battalions of colonial regulars. When Phips sent an emissary to demand Frontenac s surrender, the French governor-general felt confident enough to say:  I have no reply to make to your general other than from the mouths of my cannons and muskets  (Canadian Biography). Phips was up to the challenge. On 18 October, he landed his men four miles below Quebec, but they had no sooner begun their march toward the town then they came under fire from French militia and their Wabanaki allies, sheltering in the dense forest. The next day, Phips s warships opened a cannonade against the town but ran out of ammunition quicker than expected. The New England militiamen, already battered from their skirmishes in the woods, refused to assault Quebec without artillery support, forcing Phips to call off the attack. On 23 October, he negotiated a prisoner exchange with Frontenac before loading his men back on the ships and setting sail for Boston. Remove Ads  The War Rages On For the next several years, the cycle of retaliatory raids continued. In 1691, a Wabanaki war party raided the town of Wells in Maine, before travelling to the coastline, boarding an English vessel, and slaughtering its crew. On 24 January 1692, Father Louis-Pierre Thury and Penobscot Chief Madockawando led 300 Acadians and Wabanakis to the town of York   that night, they slaughtered over 100 English settlers and took 80 captives, in an event known as the Candlemas Massacre. Such surprise attacks caused a wave of fear to spread throughout the English colonies, as every frontier settlement wondered if it would be the next to suffer the French and Wabanaki wrath; some scholars speculate that this hysteria helped fuel the infamous Salem Witch Trials of 1692-93. The English responded to these raids in kind. Church led a third expedition into Acadia in 1692, burning and pillaging as he went, and the following year, English frigates returned to Port Royal to burn it for a third time. Battle of Quebec in 1690 Charles Van Tenac (Public Domain) In 1693, tired of the fighting, English officials in Boston entered peace negotiations with the Abenaki, part of the Wabanaki Confederacy. Frontenac, wishing to disrupt such negotiations, sent one of his officers, Claude-S bastian de Villieu, to stir up trouble. Villieu travelled from village to village, recruiting Abenakis that were against the peace treaty and, on 18 July 1694, led 250 of them in an attack on Durham, New Hampshire. In the ensuing slaughter   known afterward as the Oyster River massacre   104 English settlers were killed, 27 taken captive. Villieu killed the livestock and burned the crops, manufacturing a famine for the survivors. The war then settled into a lull until 1696, when the French launched a largescale attack on Iroquois towns in New York and Saint-Castin led a raid on the rebuilt English fort of Pemaquid. After successfully taking the fort, Saint-Castin went on to raze nearly every English settlement in Newfoundland, resulting in over 100 deaths. Church once again retaliated by launching his fourth and final expedition into Acadia. End of the War On 30 October 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick was signed in Europe, ending the Nine Years  War and   by extension   ending King William s War as well. Among other things, the treaty stipulated that New France, New England, and New York would all return to their prewar boundaries, thereby leaving several border disputes   like the one between Acadia and Maine   unresolved. Though England and France were now formally at peace, scattered fighting between the English and Wabanaki continued until January 1699, when the two parties signed a treaty in Casco Bay, Maine. The Iroquois, likewise, remained at war with the French. Frontenac, looking to get revenge on the Iroquois for their raids into New France, launched several devastating attacks on Iroquois villages in the late 1690s. The Iroquois appealed to their allies in New York for help but the English, tired of fighting, remained indifferent. It was not until 1701 that the Iroquois finally made peace with the French. The end of the war did nothing to resolve the high tensions in North America. Indeed, these tensions would soon spill over into the second great colonial conflict of the era, Queen Anne s War.",

        "content": "Balnuaran of Clava Dave Conner (CC BY-NC-SA) Clava Cairns is an early Bronze Age site in Scotland, located east of the city of Inverness, consisting of three well-preserved cairns (two of which are passage graves) and a number of free-standing stones strategically placed for astronomical purposes. The full name of the site is the Prehistoric Burial Cairns of the Balnuaran of Clava which is usually shortened to The Balnuaran of Clava and, informally, Clava Cairns. Although formerly classified as a Neolithic Period site, in 2000 Professor Richard Bradley conclusively proved it was constructed in the Bronze Age and, since the publication of his work, similarities between the monuments at Clava Cairns and other Bronze Age sites have been increasingly noted. Remove Ads  Clava Cairns has become increasingly popular since the publication of the Outlander books (and later TV series) by Diana Gabaldon as many have claimed that the site inspired her first work. Gabaldon, however, has denied this, noting that she had not yet visited Scotland and knew nothing of Clava Cairns when she wrote the first book. Date & Name The cairns date from circa 2500 BCE, but the location is thought to have been in use much earlier, and later additions date to circa 2000 BCE. The site was in continual use for over 1000 years and evidence suggests reuse by communities, intermittently, until 770 as a burial ground and center for rituals. The cairns themselves have been identified as graves but were clearly constructed with astronomical alignments in mind. Scholars Alwyn and Brinley Rees define the meaning of a cairn: Remove Ads  A cairn is a mound of stones erected over a burial or at some other point with other-world associations, such as wherever a man has died out-of-doors or where a coffin has rested. (188) Even so, a cairn may also represent wholeness and specifically the whole of a country, of a collective people, such as those in Ireland or Scotland, which both have a significant number of cairns throughout. The scholars Rees discuss the significance of the cairns of Ireland: Every beehive tomb in Greece is a symbol of the omphalos ('navel' of the earth); every stupa (gravemound) in India is a miniature of Mount Meru in the middle of the world. In Yorubaland, [the ethnologist] Leo Frobenius found little clay cult objects which consisted of a central cone, representing the god of world order, with four smaller cones around it representing the gods of the cardinal points. Similarly, every cairn in Ireland represents the whole. (187-188) In this same way, it is thought, Clava Cairns represented Scotland as a whole but, more importantly, Scotland's specific place in the universe. According to Andis Kaulins of Megaliths.net, 'Bal' meant 'Pole' and 'Nuaran' 'River of Light', thus linking the site to the Milky Way and designating Balnuaran as the center of the heavens from which the ancients could chart the stars. Remove Ads  Clava Cairns, Scotland Holly Hayes (CC BY-NC-SA) This may well be, and the site certainly has astronomical significance, but researcher-writer London Crotty of the University of North Carolina Greensboro, offers a simpler and more grounded definition of Balnuaran as \"Home of the Nairn\" noting how \"Bal\" (the anglicized version of Scottish Gaelic baile) means \"village\" or \"home\" while \"Narann\" (also given as \"Nuaran\") is the Scottish Gaelic for \"Nairn\", as in the River Nairn that flows past the site (personal email, October 2025). This definition still suggests Clava Cairns as a \"pole\"   a notable spot   on a river that is part of the lives of Scottish communities for 35 miles (56 km), linking the site to the greater whole. There are 45 other cairns in the Inverness-Nairn valley which form a definite pattern corresponding to the planets, but this particular site seems to have a special resonance with the people as evidenced by the construction of the cairns in their original state, which differs from other sites on a grander scale. it was once not only an astronomical observatory but also a burial ground for the most prestigious members of the local community. Scholarship on the site agrees that it was once not only an astronomical observatory but also a burial ground for the most prestigious members of the local community. It is evident that the cairns were constructed to honor the dead but, at the same time, to mark the passing of the seasons and provide people with a means of regulating a calendar. Remove Ads  The passage graves are aligned to the winter solstice and the standing stones, likewise, serve astronomical purposes. At the same time, however, the monuments may have served a spiritual/religious purpose as physical evidence of their original lavish construction and ring-and-cup marks on the stones suggests. The Cairns at Clava Excavations at the site began in 1828 and continued, at intervals, through the 1990's. The most recent, and extensive, work has been done by Professor Richard Bradley whose work The Good Stones: A New Investigation of the Clava Cairns maintains that the location of the cairns was not only essential to astronomical observations but also to communication between different communities in different regions. The site is located at the northeastern end of the Great Glen of the Highlands of Scotland which people used   and still do today   in traveling from the north of Scotland to the south and west. Clava Cairns, then, could have served as some central meeting place which clans far to the south could have easily located; all they would have to do would be to follow the Great Glen north to the \"Home of the Nairn.\" Remove Ads  The cairns at the site have been designated the North-East Cairn, Central Cairn, and South-West Cairn. It is thought that there were at least two other cairns at the site which are no longer extant. The North-East and South-West Cairns are both passage graves with entrances built leading to a circular center. The Central Cairn completely encloses the circular space inside, and it is thought that bodies may have been cremated here based on finds in the 1950's which uncovered cremated bone and evidence of recurring fires. There is a fourth, poorly preserved, structure at the site known as the Kerb Cairn which, today, is only a circle of stones near to the Central Cairn. The 1950's excavations designated this stone ring a gravesite, though no human remains were uncovered, based on the similarity of construction to the nearby ancient cemetery of Milton of Clava. All three cairns are surrounded by upright, slender, standing stones of slightly different color. While these upright stones bear no symbols, some of the stones which make up the cairns are inscribed with ring-and-cup marks. Examples of the mysterious circles carved in stones have been found all over the United Kingdom and beyond. No one knows what the circles symbolized to the ancient carvers, but it appears the petroglyphs were wrought using stone tools or deer antlers. It is possible   even likely   that the ring-and-cup marks symbolize an unknown tripartite deity or the Triple-Goddess of the Maiden-Matron-Crone who appear in a number of locales throughout the Celtic world. The marks might also suggest the journey through life as symbolized by the spiral which would mirror the construction of the passage graves as a kind of labyrinth. Bradley's Excavations The North-East and South-West passage graves, excavated by Professor Bradley in the 1990's, along with the rest of the site, exemplify these engravings, but whether these were carved into the stones before they were in place or after is unknown. Professor Bradley concluded that the entire site was originally constructed during a single phase, but this only means that the stones and the cairns were erected at once, and it sheds no light on whether the ring-and-cup marks were engraved before or after the stones were set in place. Digs at the site have revealed bone fragments indicating that this site, like others, was most certainly a burial ground. Bradley reports: Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! A few flecks of cremated bone were found on the surface of the platform [of the north-east cairn and] over a hundred lithic artifacts were recovered during the excavation and samples were taken for study by soil micromorphology, pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating. (Bradley, 1, Historic Environment Record) It appears, however, that it served as a final resting place for a very select few and was not a cemetery for the common people. No complete skeletal remains have been recovered from the site, and it is probable that only one person was buried in each of the cairns or, perhaps, only a single person at the entire site. The Balnuaran of Clava (Clava Cairns) Dave Conner (CC BY-NC-SA) It has been speculated, based on the amount of quartz found in proximity to the cairns, that they were once adorned with the white stone which would have caused them to almost glow and this suggests the importance of the site to ancient people. Professor Bradley has shown that stone rubble was used to initially help hold the larger stones of the cairns in place and that this rubble then extended outwards toward the eleven monoliths which surround the site. These smaller rocks and gravel, after the stones of the cairns were fully situated, were then spread to form an even platform between the structures and the monoliths so that, taken together with the quartz-covered cairns, the site would have been most impressive. Astronomical Significance Professor Alexander Thom conclusively showed, in the 1940's,, that the entranceways of the passage graves align directly and, in correspondence with the standing stones, point to the winter sun's setting position. The cairns are now all open to the sky and rise to a height of about five feet (1.5 m) but evidence suggests that they were once much higher than the ruins one sees today, probably at least ten feet (3 m) tall, and that the inner chamber of each cairn was enclosed by a roof. On the winter solstice, sunlight beams directly into the chambers of the passage graves, illuminating the rooms which would have been in darkness the rest of the year. Regarding this, Historic Scotland observes: Remove Ads  The [North-East Cairn] is aligned on the midwinter solstice. In recent years this phenomenon has been observed by covering the chamber and passage with tarpaulin. This showed that on a clear day the rays of the setting sun travel down the passage and divide the chamber in half. A beam of intense light focuses on the back wall. The same effect would have been visible in the south-west cairn where the view is obstructed by a modern farmhouse. (Historic Scotland.gov.uk) The midwinter solstice is recognized as a matter of considerable importance to the ancients as so many early structures are found aligned to it (such as the famous site of Maeshowe in Orkney, Scotland, and Newgrange in Ireland, to name only two). As with more famous locations, the cairns at Clava are situated so precisely that, when considered in a pattern with other sites nearby, an astronomical purpose is very clearly suggested. Scholars John and Julia Keay write: It has been noted that a line through the passages of the two passage graves points exactly to a spot on the horizon corresponding to the midwinter sunset. This is unlikely to be fortuitous, although the significance and meaning of the alignment is a matter of controversy. It also appears that the cairns and their surrounding stone circles are laid out with complex geometrical accuracy, suggesting a knowledge of practical mathematics and astronomy. (165) Clava Cairns Panorama Bettany Weeks (CC BY-NC-ND) The  controversy  the Keays allude to is the interpretation of the site by visitors in the modern day who often conclude, skeptically, that the cairns are simply mounds of stones farmers cleared from their fields and piled in heaps. This interpretation is untenable when one considers the precision with which the cairns are constructed, their astronomical alignment, and the physical evidence of long use of the site as ritually significant. Further, as has been noted, the cairns at Clava form a discernible pattern with other monuments in the area but were constructed on a grander scale, which makes clear that this site was significantly more important than the others. The Keays note: Other cairns of this type in the Inverness area suggest a regional Bronze Age culture which built its burial cairns to a slightly different pattern to other regions of Scotland. The Clava type is very distinctive, although it incorporates the same elements   burial chamber, passages, kerbs   found elsewhere. (165) The distinctive nature of the cairns at Clava no doubt had a specific meaning but what the meaning might be is unknown. It is certain, however, that these cairns   as others throughout Scotland, Ireland, Britain, and elsewhere   were constructed as monuments intimately connected to memory. Memory & the Cairns of Clava From ancient times to the present day, people keep the past alive through remembrance. Ancient Mesopotamian tombs were inscribed with the name and deeds of the deceased just as they were in Egypt, China, Greece, Rome, and elsewhere. In ancient Greece, in fact, the remembrance of the dead ensured their survival in the afterlife, and in Egypt, tomb offerings were made daily for the sustenance of the departed. In China, tomb-sweeping day   in which one visits and tends to the graves of one's relatives   has been observed for centuries and continues to be in the present day. It is probable, then, whatever other uses Clava Cairns served, it was a place of remembrance. The astronomical positioning of the graves and standing stones would not have taken away from the aspect of those structures as memorials either to an individual, a group, an event, or a reminder of the essential nature of life as change and one's eternal journey after death. Scholar Rodney Castleden writes: Long memories are characteristic of Celtic communities. The Druids leaned totally on memory. They had to devote themselves to great efforts of learning. Julius Caesar noted that the Druids  are said to learn by heart a great number of verses.  They went so far as to spurn writing in order to intensify their dependence on memory. In Druidry there is a deep and abiding connection between memory and nature. The earth itself is regarded as remembering everything; it is a witness to history in a way that we cannot fully appreciate. (447) Anyone who has spent any time in Ireland or Scotland is aware of the power and strength of the Celtic memory. Along these lines, the cairns would have served as memorials; although what exactly they were memorializing remains uncertain. The ring-and-cup marks at the site continue to defy efforts at interpretation   as they do elsewhere   but could signify the mystical concept of the Rule of Three in which  multiplying an image was a simple way of emphasizing it  and  the most common way of doing this was to multiply an image by three  (Castleden, 459). Deities are frequently represented in Celtic iconography in three's   as they are elsewhere   but the ring-and-cup marks might also represent individuals or, placed as they are at Clava Cairns, the spiral concept of the labyrinth. Remove Ads  Panorama of The Balnuaran of Clava Cairns Joshua J. Mark (CC BY) Conclusion Labyrinths, whether in ancient Egypt or Greece, were associated with the dead and one's journey through the afterlife but are also associated with one's life prior to death and one's journey to wholeness. The choices one makes inside a labyrinth either confuse and lead to frustration and loss or strengthen and lead to completion and fulfillment. Castleden observes that  the spiral is the simplest form of labyrinth, one in which no choices are presented beyond the choice to travel. It is a single path, a path to the center and back  (467). The passage graves at Clava Cairns certainly present one with only this one choice and the ring-and-cup marks could have been carved to emphasize the cyclical nature of life so inherent in Celtic mythology and lore. In this view, nothing and no one ever dies; all things merely change and become something else. The seemingly linear path one travels between birth and death does not actually begin at birth or end with death; everything that dies comes back in some renewed form or continues on eternally. The cairns at Clava could have been raised to emphasize this understanding as well as commemorate those who had passed on to the next phase of existence on their eternal journey.",

        "content": "Table of Contents Quick Summary Ask the Chatbot a Question Also important to Sri Lanka s cultural development has been its position as the nexus of important maritime trade routes between Europe , the Middle East , and Asia. Long before the European discovery of an oceanic route to India in the 15th century, Sri Lanka was known to Greek, Roman, Persian, Armenian, Arab, Malay, and Chinese sailors. With the coming of the Europeans, however, the strategic importance of Sri Lanka increased, and Western maritime powers fought to control its shores. Both Sri Lanka and India came under European influence and colonial rule. This common experience worked to tighten the long-standing links between the two countries, and, with the attainment of independence in the mid-20th century, Sri Lankan and Indian social institutions and ideologies began to resonate more closely with each other. Despite its obvious affinities with India, Sri Lanka nevertheless developed a unique identity over the ages that ultimately set it apart from its neighbour. Cultural traits brought from India necessarily underwent independent growth and change in Sri Lanka, owing in part to the island s physical separation from the subcontinent. Buddhism, for instance, virtually disappeared from India, but it continued to flourish in Sri Lanka, particularly among the Sinhalese. Moreover, the Sinhalese language , which grew out of Indo-Aryan dialects from the mainland, eventually became indigenous solely to Sri Lanka and developed its own literary tradition. Sri Lanka has had a continuous record of human settlement for more than two millennia, and its civilization has been shaped largely by that of the Indian subcontinent. The island s two major ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and the Tamils , and its two dominant religions, Buddhism and Hinduism , made their way to the island from India , and Indian influence pervaded such diverse fields as art, architecture, literature, music, medicine, and astronomy. history of Sri Lanka , a survey of the notable events and people in the history of Sri Lanka from ancient times to the present day. The country, formerly known as Ceylon, is an island lying in the Indian Ocean and separated from peninsular India by the Palk Strait . Proximity to the Indian subcontinent has facilitated close cultural interaction between Sri Lanka and India from ancient times. At a crossroads of maritime routes traversing the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has also been exposed to cultural influences from other Asian civilizations. Geologically, Sri Lanka is an extension of peninsular India that separated from the mainland perhaps as recently as the Miocene Epoch (roughly 25 to 5 million years ago). Archaeological excavations undertaken since the late 20th century have indicated that the island already supported human inhabitants some 75,000 to 125,000 years ago. The earliest occupants of the region were, like other Paleolithic peoples, hunters and gatherers who made and used fairly rough stone tools. Finer tools made of quartz and occasionally of chert become visible in the archaeological record about 28,000 years ago. The artifacts from this era, which include many microliths (very small, sharp flakes of stone that can be used individually or hafted together to make a serrated edge), have been found throughout the country, especially among the grasslands of the hills and the sandy tracts of the coast. By about the 9th century bce, people had begun to experiment with food production and irrigation and had gained access to some of the iron tools produced on the continent. Early settlement and the spread of Buddhism Sri Lanka s earliest human inhabitants of whom there is direct fossil evidence were hunter-gatherers in the area of Balangoda in the south. Urban settlements first appeared in the 10th century bce near Anuradhapura in north-central Sri Lanka. The ancestors of the Sinhalese, who were speakers of Indo-Aryan languages, migrated from northern India about the 5th century bce. The Tamils were probably later immigrants from areas of central, eastern, and southern India where Dravidian languages were spoken; their early migrations spanned a period from about the 3rd century bce to about 1200 ce. Sri Lanka possesses a historical tradition preserved in written form by Buddhist chroniclers. The earliest of the extant chronicles is the Dipavamsa ( Island s Chronicle ), compiled probably by Buddhist nuns in the 4th century ce. The Dipavamsa was followed by the Mahavamsa ( Great Chronicle ) and its continuation, called the Culavamsa ( Little Chronicle ). Together, these chronicles constitute a literary record of the establishment and growth of Sinhalese political power and of Sri Lankan Buddhism; however, the documents must be used with caution and always in conjunction with archaeological especially epigraphic material.

Legendary origins According to the Sinhalese tradition, as recorded in the Mahavamsa, the first Indian settlers on Sri Lanka were Prince Vijaya and his 700 followers, who landed on the west coast near Puttalam (5th century bce). They had been banished for misconduct from the kingdom of Sinhapura in northern India by Vijaya s father, King Sinhabahu, who put them all in a ship and drove them away. When Vijaya s band landed on the island, it was inhabited by yakshas (a type of spirit; perhaps referring here to human members of a cult of yaksha devotees), whom they defeated and chased into the interior. Vijaya married a yaksha princess and had two children by her. Later he drove her and the children away and sent to the Madurai court in India for a Pandu (probably referring to the Pandya dynasty) princess and for wives for his 700 followers. Vijaya settled down to reign as king after a ceremonial enthronement and marriage and founded a dynasty. He had no heir to the throne, and toward the end of his reign he sent for his younger brother at Sinhapura. The brother, unwilling to leave his native land, sent his youngest son, Panduvasudeva, to Sri Lanka. Panduvasudeva landed with 32 followers at Gokanna (now Trincomalee) on the east coast. He was enthroned at Upatissagama and continued the Vijaya dynasty. Indo-Aryan settlement in Sri Lanka The account of Sri Lanka s settlement as presented in the Mahavamsa contains an element of historical fact the settlers were Indo-Aryan peoples from northern India. However, controversy exists as to the exact provenance of the early settlers; the legends contain evidence pointing to both the northeastern and the northwestern parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Vijaya s ancestors hailed from Bengal, in the northeast, but his father established himself subsequently in Gujarat, the area in northwest India from which the adventurers were put out to sea. Before arriving in Sri Lanka, their ship called at Supara, on the west coast of India. Their landing in Sri Lanka, at Tambapanni, near Puttalam, would indicate their arrival from western India. Some early tribal names occurring in Sri Lanka also suggest connections with northwestern India and the Indus River region. While considerable evidence points to western India as the home of the first immigrants, it seems probable that a subsequent wave arrived from the vicinity of Bengal and Odisha in the northeast. One band of settlers landed in Sri Lanka at the east-coast port of Gokanna, a natural port of disembarkation for vessels arriving from the Bay of Bengal. The traditional accounts of the arrival of Panduvasudeva may portray a second wave of migration following the first mentioned in the Vijaya legend. Linguistic affinities between the early Sinhalese- and Prakrit-speaking peoples of eastern India strengthen the hypothesis of a migration from this area. The tradition speaks primarily of settlement by conquest, and tribes of conquerors led by a warrior nobility would certainly have propelled the Indo-Aryan migration southward. Also important, however, was the pursuit of trade (as opposed to military conquest). Indo-Aryan merchants probably reached Sri Lanka while sailing down the Indian coast, and some of these merchants, motivated by a lucrative trade in Sri Lanka s natural products, may have founded settlements. The view that Indo-Aryan migrants laid the foundations of Sinhalese civilization increasingly has come into question since the late 20th century. Archaeological evidence has indicated that settled agriculture, tank irrigation, use of iron, and pottery were features present before the Indo-Aryan migrations. During the early phases of these migrations, a synthesis seems to have taken place between Indo-Aryan, pre-Indo-Aryan, and possibly Dravidian elements to create the early Sinhalese culture of the Anuradhapura period, which spanned the 3rd century bce to the 10th century ce. The chronicled account of Vijaya s confrontation with the yakshas and the search for consorts in the Pandu kingdom of Madurai (if this may be presumed to be the Pandya Tamil kingdom of southern India) point to such integration. In any case, Indo-Aryan settlements grew in different parts of the island from about the 5th century bce. The settlers came in numerous clans or tribes; the most powerful were the Sinhalese, who eventually gave their name to the descendants of the various groups. The earliest settlers were those on the west-central coast, who pushed inland along the Malwatu River and founded a number of riverbank villages. Their seat of government was Upatissagama. Tradition attributes the founding of the kingdom of Anuradhapura to Pandukkabhaya, the third king of the Vijaya dynasty. With its growth as the strongest Sinhalese kingdom, the city of Anuradhapura and the nearby settlements flourished. Kings built up the city and developed it for urban life as they extended royal control over villages and outlying settlements. With the establishment of strong government, the population grew and the kingdom expanded into the north-central region.",

        "title": "Delhi or Democracy? The Sri Lankan Tamil Dilemma Haunted by History..!",
        "content": "Delhi or Democracy? The Sri Lankan Tamil Dilemma Haunted by History..! -By LeN South Asia Correspondent (Lanka-e-News -04.July.2025, 11.30 PM) Beneath the gentle palm-fringed skyline of Jaffna and the rain-soaked hills of Sri Lanka s tea country, an old question lingers like the morning mist: Why do Tamil politicians still place their faith in New Delhi rather than engage constructively with Colombo? It is a question that ruffles feathers in both capitals   and among the increasingly disillusioned Tamil population of the north and east. For decades, leaders such as M.A. Sumanthiran, a senior Tamil parliamentarian and prominent figure in the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), have looked to India   not Sri Lanka s own institutions   as the saviour of Tamil political aspirations. But with history being what it is, many now ask: Hasn t India already had its say   and its way   with Tamil politics in Sri Lanka? A History Etched in Betrayal To understand today s paradox, one must first revisit the turbulent 1980s. In a move that would permanently reshape Sri Lanka s post-independence history, India   under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi   began training and arming Tamil rebel groups to destabilise Colombo s rule in the north and east. Officially, New Delhi cited its concern for the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Unofficially, the Indian intelligence community viewed Colombo s growing ties with Washington and its flirtation with regional non-alignment as a threat to Indian hegemony in the Indian Ocean. According to former Indian intelligence officials who later spoke on record, the aim was not Tamil liberation   but Tamil leverage.  We didn t want to break Sri Lanka. We wanted to bend it,  said a retired Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) operative during a 2013 academic symposium in Chennai. The results were devastating. Indian-financed militancy fractured the democratic Tamil political movement, radicalised its youth, and transformed grievances into warfare. The armed struggle, led by multiple groups and later dominated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), effectively destroyed the peaceful Tamil federalist movement   and invited catastrophic retaliation. When the Master Turned on the Monster By the late 1980s, India s monster had grown too large to control. The LTTE refused to be a puppet   assassinating rivals, rejecting Indian-imposed settlements, and eventually turning their guns on Indian forces themselves. The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987, signed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J.R. Jayewardene, brought in the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). Ostensibly there to protect Tamil civilians and disarm the rebels, the IPKF ended up embroiled in bitter combat with the LTTE and was accused of extensive civilian atrocities. By the time the IPKF exited in 1990, more than 1,200 Indian soldiers were dead, thousands of Tamil civilians had been killed or maimed, and Sri Lanka s sovereignty had been profoundly violated. Many in the north still speak of the Indian occupation with bitterness   not as peacekeeping, but as punishment. And yet, three decades later, Tamil politicians like Sumanthiran continue to seek Indian support as if 1987 never happened. Sumanthiran and the High Commission Circuit The image is familiar to Colombo s diplomatic watchers: Tamil MPs   mostly from the TNA   making their rounds at the Indian High Commission, attending closed-door meetings, requesting interventions, and issuing statements that echo New Delhi s geopolitical narratives. While such diplomacy is technically within their rights as elected officials, critics see something more troubling   an abdication of local agency.  Why do Tamil leaders still behave as if New Delhi holds the keys to their destiny?  asks Dr. Niranjan Sathasivam, a political science lecturer at the University of Peradeniya.  India has used, discarded, and destroyed the Tamil struggle. It is not a neutral party. And yet, they treat Delhi as both priest and prophet.  Indeed, while the BJP government under Narendra Modi has increased symbolic gestures   cultural exchanges, temple restoration funds, high-level visits   it has offered no serious commitment to constitutional reform, federal devolution, or post-war justice in Sri Lanka. Nor does it appear particularly inclined to do so.  The BJP is not interested in Tamil self-determination. They are interested in countering China and influencing the Sri Lankan political balance,  said a Western diplomat in Colombo. Yet Sumanthiran, a devout Christian, is now seen by some as genuflecting not before his faith, but before Modi s political machinery.  It s as if he s praying to the BJP,  said a Tamil journalist in Jaffna.  He has never once criticised India for their betrayal. Never mentioned the IPKF atrocities. Never acknowledged that India armed our youth only to annihilate them.  Playing the Indian Card   Again Sumanthiran and his allies maintain that Indian involvement remains essential because of Sri Lanka s \"unreliable majoritarianism\". Colombo, they argue, has repeatedly broken promises to the Tamil people   from the aborted Bandaranaike Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 to the stalled 13th Amendment implementation promised under Indian auspices.  We cannot ignore the regional context,  Sumanthiran told local media in April.  India is our closest neighbour and has always played a key role in shaping Sri Lanka s political landscape.  But to many Tamil civil society members, that logic feels outdated   and humiliating.  Do we really want to be begging from the same country that trained child soldiers on our soil and then bombed our villages?  asked a senior activist in Mullaitivu.  Do we have no shame?  Others point to the irony that even today, India publicly insists the solution must come from within Sri Lanka   while Tamil politicians keep flying to Delhi or whispering to Indian envoys in Colombo. The NPP Moment   A Lost Opportunity? In the wake of Sri Lanka s historic economic collapse and the political shift it triggered, the National People s Power (NPP) party   led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake   has emerged as a formidable alternative. The party, with its leftist credentials and anti-corruption stance, has made overtures to Tamil constituencies, offering a new beginning based on equality and decentralisation. Many in the south view the NPP as the first Sinhala-majority party in decades willing to talk seriously about Tamil grievances without racial posturing. Yet, curiously, the Tamil political leadership has remained lukewarm.  They have not even formally sat down with the NPP leadership to explore a framework,  said Prof. Rajan Hoole, a Tamil academic and human rights campaigner.  They are still waiting for Modi.  This hesitation has caused increasing friction with Tamil civil society groups, who are now demanding that the TNA and its allies stop using Indian influence as a shortcut to domestic engagement.  The NPP may not be perfect,  said Rev. Emmanuel Navaratnam, a priest from Kilinochchi.  But they are here. They are willing. They are not the same as the old chauvinist parties. Why are our politicians wasting time in Delhi when they should be in Colombo negotiating real change?  Pawn Politics and Diaspora Discontent For the vast and influential Tamil diaspora   particularly in the UK, Canada, and Australia   this pattern of dependence on India is becoming increasingly unacceptable.  In the 1980s, they asked us to fund the armed struggle. Then we were told to support political engagement. Now they re asking us to trust India again?  said Arun Siva, a Tamil barrister based in London.  We ve been pawns in every geopolitical chess game. Enough is enough.  There is growing pressure within diaspora groups to shift focus back to community rebuilding, economic development, and local political engagement   not proxy games with regional powers. A recent open letter signed by over 70 Tamil professionals worldwide criticised Sri Lankan Tamil MPs for  outsourcing political responsibility to New Delhi  and called for a  homegrown Tamil political movement rooted in accountability and dignity.  The Lasting Damage The costs of this political outsourcing are not abstract. The 30-year war that followed India s meddling cost Sri Lanka trillions in lost economic output, destroyed generations of Tamil youth, and militarised the state in ways that persist to this day. And yet, there has never been a formal Tamil political reckoning with India s role.  There is collective amnesia,  said Dr. Shamara Pathmanathan, a political psychologist.  No memorials for the Tamil civilians killed by the IPKF. No parliamentary resolutions. It s as if Tamil political leaders are afraid to speak the truth about India   lest the patron turns its back.  But increasingly, younger Tamils are asking: Is silence about Indian betrayal a prerequisite for Tamil leadership? The Future: Engagement, Not Submission As Sri Lanka slowly emerges from its post-default fog and grapples with systemic reforms, the question remains: Will Tamil politicians finally turn inward and engage with the country s evolving democratic space, or will they continue to outsource Tamil destiny to a foreign capital that has done more harm than good? There are signs of a generational shift. Grassroots Tamil movements in the north are beginning to bypass party structures. Young leaders are calling for cross-ethnic coalitions, justice for war victims, land rights, and language equality   within the framework of Sri Lanka s evolving political architecture.  We need truth. We need courage,  said 28-year-old activist Yalini Thurairajah, speaking at a recent youth forum in Batticaloa.  And we need leaders who stop asking for favours and start demanding rights   here, not in Delhi.  -By LeN South Asia Correspondent --------------------------- by (2025-07-04 23:18:18) We are unable to continue LeN without your kind donation.

        "content": "By T. Ramakrishnan The recently consecrated Thiruketheeswaram temple in Mannar in Sri Lanka s Northern Province has come to symbolise close ties between Tamil Nadu and the island nation, thanks to the involvement of the Government College of Architecture and Sculpture, Mamallapuram, in the temple s restoration. Regarded as one of the five important abodes of Lord Shiva in Sri Lanka, the temple, said to have been worshipped by Saivite saint Thirugnanasambandar, was damaged during the protracted civil war that ended in May 2009. It had a fresh lease of life following the Indian government s decision to fund the renovation project and lend its technical expertise. The  mahamandapam  was renovated with the support of the Mamallapuram college and materials, including granites, were procured from Tamil Nadu. While the Indian government provided a grant of LKR 320 million for the restoration, which eventually cost LKR 900 million, the Archaeological Survey of India supervised its execution. Beyond Thirukeetheswaram, the relationship between the two territories can be traced to the proto-historic times. Marks, similar to graffiti inscribed potsherds discovered during early excavations at Adichanallur, Korkai and many other sites of the Early Historic period, were recovered from places such as Tissamaharama, Kantarodai, Manthai and Ridiyagama in Sri Lanka, according to a 2019 publication of the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology on Keeladi. Historians also refer to continuous trade links between the two regions, citing the discoveries in Tamil Nadu of Sinhala Prakrit inscriptions on pottery. In fact, veteran numismatist, art historian and archaeologist of Sri Lanka Osmund Bopearachchi has even recorded in a 2008 paper on ancient Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu that Sinhalese traders were present in Tamil Nadu in the same period when Tamil traders were active at Anuradhapura and Tissamaharama in Sri Lanka. He has also stated that the epigraphic and literary evidence for  the active role played by Tamil merchants in the early phase of Sri Lanka s history is numerous . In a conversation with this newspaper in 2017, Dr. Bopearachchi, former Adjunct Professor of Central and South Asian Art, Archaeology, and Numismatics, University of California, Berkeley, said,  The earliest coins found in Sri Lanka were Pandya and Chera coins.  In K.A. Nilakanta Sastri s seminal work, A History of South India, one can find numerous accounts of battles between rulers of southern India and Sri Lanka. A significant account of them pertains to how Rajendra Chola-I (1012-44 CE) completed the conquest of Sri Lanka begun by his father Rajaraja Chola (985-1016 CE) and Mahinda V s son, Kassapa, became the centre of Sinhalese resistance to the Tamil power. Sri Lanka s prominent historian K.M. de Silva, in his landmark work A History of Sri Lanka, points out that Nayakkars, who belonged to the Vaduga caste,  a Telugu-speaking group originally hailing from Madurai,  established marriage ties with the Kandyan royal family during the 17th century. He adds that the accession of the Nayakkar dynasty to the Kandyan throne in 1739 CE was  accommodated with the minimum of disturbance . On the side of culture and religion, Kataragama in the deep south, once regarded by people in Tamil Nadu as one of the six abodes of Lord Muruga, has shrines for Muruga, Shiva and Deivanai Amman, making any visitor from Tamil Nadu feel at home. Aimed at attracting a larger number of tourists from Tamil Nadu, the Sri Lankan authorities are planning to launch a Muruga trail, apart from the old Ramayana trail. Rajaraja Chola had got people of Sri Lanka involved in the construction of the Brihadeeswara temple in Thanjavur, says M. Rajendran, former Vice-Chancellor of Tamil University. G.P.V. Somaratna, former Head of Department of History and Political Science, University of Colombo, in his paper  Tamil Buddhism in Sri Lanka , states that the presence of Buddhism in ancient Tamil Nadu had a  great impact  on Buddhist activities in Sri Lanka and the northern part of the island in particular. Since the classical period, there have been significant contributions from literary personalities belonging to Sri Lanka s Tamils to Tamil literature. Tamil scholar of yesteryear Mu. Varadarajan, in his work on the history of Tamil literature ( Tamil Illakkiya Varalaru), records that Eezhathu Poothanthevanar, a poet from Sri Lanka, had composed seven verses of the Sangam anthology. Ayathurai Santhan, an award-winning Sri Lankan Tamil writer, notes that one of the Tamil classics, Manimekalai, refers to an islet, Manipallavam, which has been identified with the present Nainativu of Sri Lanka. Dr. Rajendran observes that the Pathni cult, the worship of Kannaki, had spread to Sri Lanka from Tamil Nadu. Prominent scholars Arumuga Navalar (1822-1889) and C.V. Damodaram Pillai (1832-1901) had strong connections with Chennai. Tiruppur Krishnan, editor of Amudhasurabhi, refers to Vipulananda Adigal (1892-1947), who was known not only for his work in the expansion of activities of Ramakrishna Mission in Sri Lanka but also for his contribution to Tamil literature. He recalls how veteran writer-editors such as Ki. Va. Jagannathan (1906-88) and Naa. Parthasarathy (1932-87) made it a point to visit Sri Lanka regularly for mobilising subscriptions for their journals, Kalaimagal and Deepam. Mr. Santhan is of the view that K. Kailasapathy, Karthigesu Sivathamby, Dominic Jeeva and Se. Ganesalingan were among those who left behind a huge impact on the Tamil literary field. In recent years, the social relationship between people of Sri Lanka and those of India in general, Tamil Nadu in particular, has only grown due to a variety of reasons. Be it the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom or the present spell of economic crisis, sections of Sri Lankan society have found in Tamil Nadu a safe haven. But, given the historical, cultural and sociological factors, there are deeper reasons for the peoples of the two lands to be closer than what they have been. (The Hindu)",

        "title": "Sri Lankan Newsrooms In The 1950s: Before The Advent Of The Internet, Phones, And Smartphones",
        "content": "The 1950s are considered the  golden age  of Sri Lankan journalism, producing many giants such as Denzil Peiris, Mervyn de Silva, Tarzie Vittachi, Ira Amarasekera, and Piyasena Nissanka. At the time, there were only two main news publishers in the country the Times group and the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited, better known as the  Lake House . Both these companies were privately owned and had large audiences because newspapers and radios were the only methods of communications during that era. The Times group published two main newspapers the Times of Ceylon and the Lankadeepa, while the Lake House published the Daily News, Dinamina, Thinakaran, and the Sunday Observer. The journalists produced in Sri Lanka at that time were considered to be on par with their contemporaries abroad, despite working under conditions very different to our own: news publishers of the 1950s were not exposed to the advent of mobile phones, the internet, and smartphones, and news was gathered and produced in ways very different from now. Dress code Even the way a journalist dressed in the 1950s was very different to the way they dressed now, veteran editor Edmund Ranasinghe told Roar Media. Today, journalists mostly dress in casual clothing an untucked shirt with pants or jeans, for instance but the journalist of the 1950s was expected to wear a shirt and a tie. Coats were also mandatory if setting out for an assignment, as was a hat a dictum probably influenced by the British. One thing in particular that stood out then, from the way things are done now, is the manner in which relationships with  sources  are cultivated, Edmund Ranasinghe told Roar Media. Back in the day, journalists actively cultivated relationships with politicians, ministers, departments heads, and other officers of import, and maintained close links with them to preserve their sources of news. As there were no messaging or emailing platforms, it was important that the journalist kept in touch with decision makers and other people directly affecting his  beat . It was common for journalists to make appointments with politicians, ministers, departments heads, and other people in the morning hours, during which meeting, information was gathered. Deadlines for article submissions were at 1.pm, Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa, Sri Lanka s oldest active journalist told Roar Media. Journalists who went out into the  field  were expected to type out their articles and submit them to their respective News Editors before 1.pm. Whatever research was necessary for the article must also be accrued by these journalists through means far more difficult than the click away we are accustomed to; there was no internet, with its wealth of information, nor yet browsers like Google to make search easier. Instead, journalists had to pore through books and clippings at public and private libraries to find what they were looking for, and laboriously take down that information by pen before painstakingly crafting their  story  for news publications. The newspaper publishers (that is to say, the Times group and the  Lake House ) both had extensive libraries which were liberally used by the journalists in the 1950s and thereafter. Library staff maintained dossiers on notable figures of authority both in Sri Lanka and abroad, for easy access. The dossiers contained paper cutting with important information regarding people of national and international importance, and journalists were wont to sift through them to find a particular article in which a statement or action taken by a leader was documented. It was also necessary for the newsman of yore to be well-read and possess a deep knowledge of current local and international affairs. While in modern times information is only a few clicks away, the journalist from the 1950s was expected to be on his/her toes, able to engage in deep conversation on matters of national and international importance at any given time. D.F. Kariyakarawana, a former Editor at Lake House for the Janatha and Silumina papers, who worked at the Times Group and Lake House as a journalist in the 1950s wrote in his memoirs Memories of Seven Decades,  Editors back in the day thought a good English knowledge was essential even for a Sinhala language journalist going out on coverage. The same applied to photographers working with Sinhala newspapers. For instance, I remember three Burgher photographers who worked for Dinamina (a Sinhala daily newspaper) namely Don Pascal, Harvey Campbell, and Neil Moses. Even the cartoonist of the Dinamina newspaper in the 1950s was a Burgher by the name of Mark Gerrain. He could hardly write in Sinhala, although he was attached to a Sinhala paper.  International news International news was gathered by means of a teleprinter, which was connected to the Reuters newswire service, Edmund Ranasinghe told Roar Media. The machine would unceasingly print out news of international importance which was gathered by the International News Editor who earmarked the more important ones for the next day s newspaper print. This was not an easy task and an International News Editor often had a team of journalists below him to help. The newsrooms were male-dominated, Edmund Ranasinghe admits. He did say, however, that there were a few women who worked in newsrooms, mainly in the function of Sub-Editors or Features editors a feature present even today. Because newsrooms jobs or jobs as reporters were not considered female-friendly, it deterred many women from taking up jobs in the newsrooms. However, two notable female journalists emerged from that era Roshan Peiris and Ranji Handy. The kickback on smoking indoors had not taken place yet, Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa said, guiltily admitting he had been a chain smoker when he was younger, to the extent he had a lit cigarette in his hand, even while having lunch.  Till I developed a cough,  he said.  After which the doctor told me,  Young man, you will be dead before you turn 30 if you continue this way , and I quit the habit from that point on.  That didn t stop the other writers and editors from smoking both pipes and cigarettes, however, as smoking continued unabated in the newsrooms. Often, by the time lunch was over, a sizable proportion of the newsroom was already  in the cups . It appears that this did not affect their work because some of the finest journalists Sri Lanka produced were from that era. Fraternity Because the two main newspaper publishers were based in the Fort area, journalists from the rival papers often fraternized with each other at the cafes and restaurants on Chatham Street, Hospital Lane, at the Nippon Hotel, at the Lord Nelson, and the National Bar. It was customary for reporters to hang out at these restaurants and bars after work or during the day. It was here that many interesting stories were exchanged over a drink and ideas part of a journalistic lifestyle. D.F. Kariyakarawana writes in his memoirs,  During my days at the Times group, it was almost a daily ritual to go to Ratnagiri, after work (Ratnagiri is a hotel and bar located opposite to the WTC building at Echelons Square, Colombo Fort). Neville Dillamort, Chief Sub Editor of Times of Ceylon, and Ervin Moonamalai, the Chief Reporter of the paper, also joined us. Almost a half of my monthly salary was spent on Ratnagiri. Aside from drinks, our lunch was also bought from Ratnagiri.  This tradition appears to be perpetuated even by modern journalists, who often visit the Ratnagiri and other smaller bars in the Fort area to fraternize with each other over stories. Although the way stories are gathered, crafted and published has changed so much with the advent of the internet and web publishing, there are many aspects of the newsroom that remain unchanged. The passion a journalist has for pursuing a story, the idea that newspapers can create change, can chronicle events for posterity, continues to live strong in the mind of aspirants. Journalism is not easy, nor yet a popular career for many, but for those who choose it, it is a literary life. Cover: The landmark  Lake House  building, that still stands today.

        "title": "Overview of the Sri Lankan Civil War",
        "content": "Key Takeaways The Sri Lankan Civil War started because of ethnic tensions between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities. The British colonial rule aggravated tensions by favoring Tamils, creating resentment among the Sinhalese majority. The war ended in 2009 with a government victory after a long and bloody conflict. In the late 20th century, the island nation of Sri Lanka tore itself apart in a brutal civil war. At the most basic level, the conflict arose from the ethnic tension between Sinhalese and Tamil citizens. In reality, though, the causes were much more complex and arose in large part because of Sri Lanka's colonial history. Background Great Britain ruled Sri Lanka then called Ceylon from 1815 to 1948. When the British arrived, the country was dominated by Sinhalese speakers whose ancestors likely arrived on the island from India in the 500s BCE. Sri Lankan people seem to have been in contact with Tamil speakers from southern India since at least the second century BCE, but migrations of significant numbers of Tamils to the island appear to have taken place later, between the seventh and 11th centuries CE. In 1815, the population of Ceylon numbered about three million predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese and 300,000 mostly Hindu Tamils. The British established huge cash crop plantations on the island, first of coffee, and later of rubber and tea. Colonial officials brought in approximately a million Tamil speakers from India to work as plantation laborers. The British also established schools in the northern, Tamil-majority part of the colony, and preferentially appointed Tamils to bureaucratic positions, angering the Sinhalese majority. This was a common divide-and-rule tactic in European colonies that had troubling results in the post-colonial era in places such as Rwanda and Sudan. Civil War Erupts The British granted Ceylon independence in 1948. The Sinhalese majority immediately began to pass laws that discriminated against Tamils, particularly the Indian Tamils brought to the island by the British. They made Sinhalese the official language, driving Tamils out of the civil service. The Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948 effectively barred Indian Tamils from holding citizenship, making stateless people out of some 700,000. This was not remedied until 2003, and anger over such measures fueled the bloody rioting that broke out repeatedly in the following years. After decades of increasing ethnic tension, the war began as a low-level insurgency in July 1983. Ethnic riots broke out in Colombo and other cities. Tamil Tiger insurgents killed 13 army soldiers, prompting violent reprisals against Tamil civilians by their Sinhalese neighbors across the country. Between 2,500 and 3,000 Tamils likely died, and many thousands more fled to Tamil-majority regions. The Tamil Tigers declared the \"First Eelam War\" (1983-87) with the aim of creating a separate Tamil state in northern Sri Lanka called Eelam. Much of the fighting was directed initially at other Tamil factions; the Tigers massacred their opponents and consolidated power over the separatist movement by 1986. At the outbreak of the war, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India offered to mediate a settlement. However, the Sri Lankan government distrusted her motivations, and it was later shown that her government was arming and training Tamil guerrillas in camps in southern India. Relations between the Sri Lankan government and India deteriorated, as Sri Lankan coast guards seized Indian fishing boats to search for weapons. Over the next few years, violence escalated as the Tamil insurgents used car bombs, suitcase bombs, and landmines against Sinhalese military and civilian targets. The quickly-expanding Sri Lankan army responded by rounding up Tamil youths and torturing and disappearing them. India Intervenes In 1987, India's Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, decided to directly intervene in the Sri Lankan Civil War by sending peacekeepers. India was concerned about separatism in its own Tamil region, Tamil Nadu, as well as a potential flood of refugees from Sri Lanka. The peacekeepers' mission was to disarm militants on both sides, in preparation for peace talks. The Indian peacekeeping force of 100,000 troops not only was unable to quell the conflict, it actually began fighting with the Tamil Tigers. The Tigers refused to disarm, sent female bombers and child soldiers to attack the Indians, and relations escalated into running skirmishes between the peacekeeping troops and the Tamil guerrillas. In May 1990, Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa forced India to recall its peacekeepers; 1,200 Indian soldiers had died battling the insurgents. The following year, a female Tamil suicide bomber named Thenmozhi Rajaratnam assassinated Rajiv Gandhi at an election rally. President Premadasa would die in a similar attack in May 1993. Second Eelam War After the peacekeepers withdrew, the Sri Lankan Civil War entered an even bloodier phase, which the Tamil Tigers named the Second Eelam War. It began when the Tigers seized between 600 and 700 Sinhalese police officers in the Eastern Province on June 11, 1990, in an effort to weaken government control there. The police laid down their weapons and surrendered to the militants after the Tigers promised no harm would come to them. However, the militants took the policemen into the jungle, forced them to kneel, and shot them all dead, one by one. A week later, the Sri Lankan Minister of Defense announced, \"From now on, it is all out war.\" The government cut off all shipments of medicine and food to the Tamil stronghold on the Jaffna peninsula and initiated an intensive aerial bombardment. The Tigers responded with massacres of hundreds of Sinhalese and Muslim villagers. Muslim self-defense units and government troops conducted tit-for-tat massacres in Tamil villages. The government also massacred Sinhalese school children in Sooriyakanda and buried the bodies in a mass grave, because the town was a base for the Sinhala splinter group known as the JVP. In July 1991, 5,000 Tamil Tigers surrounded the government's army base at Elephant Pass, laying siege to it for a month. The pass is a bottleneck leading to the Jaffna Peninsula, a key strategic point in the region. Some 10,000 government troops raised the siege after four weeks, but over 2,000 fighters on both sides had been killed, making this the bloodiest battle in the entire civil war. Although they held this chokepoint, government troops could not capture Jaffna itself despite repeated assaults in 1992-93. Third Eelam War January 1995 saw the Tamil Tigers sign a peace agreement with the new government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga. However, three months later the Tigers planted explosives on two Sri Lankan naval gunboats, destroying the ships and the peace accord. The government responded by declaring a \"war for peace,\" in which Air Force jets pounded civilian sites and refugee camps on the Jaffna Peninsula, while ground troops perpetrated a number of massacres against civilians in Tampalakamam, Kumarapuram, and elsewhere. By December 1995, the peninsula was under government control for the first time since the war began. Some 350,000 Tamil refugees and the Tiger guerrillas fled inland to the sparsely populated Vanni region of the Northern Province. The Tamil Tigers responded to the loss of Jaffna in July 1996 by launching an eight-day assault on the town of Mullaitivu, which was protected by 1,400 government troops. Despite air support from the Sri Lankan Air Force, the government position was overrun by the 4,000-strong guerrilla army in a decisive Tiger victory. More than 1,200 of the government soldiers were killed, including about 200 who were doused with gasoline and burned alive after they surrendered; the Tigers lost 332 troops. Another aspect of the war took place simultaneously in the capital of Colombo and other southern cities, where Tiger suicide bombers struck repeatedly in the late 1990s. They hit the Central Bank in Colombo, the Sri Lankan World Trade Centre, and the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, a shrine housing a relic of the Buddha himself. A suicide bomber tried to assassinate President Chandrika Kumaratunga in December 1999 she survived but lost her right eye. In April 2000, the Tigers retook Elephant Pass but were unable to recover the city of Jaffna. Norway began trying to negotiate a settlement, as war-weary Sri Lankans of all ethnic groups looked for a way to end the interminable conflict. The Tamil Tigers declared a unilateral ceasefire in December 2000, leading to hope that the civil war was truly winding down. However, in April 2001, the Tigers rescinded the ceasefire and pushed north on the Jaffna Peninsula once more. A July 2001 Tiger suicide attack on the Bandaranaike International Airport destroyed eight military jets and four airliners, sending Sri Lanka's tourism industry into a tailspin. Long Road to Peace The September 11 attacks in the United States and the subsequent War on Terror made it more difficult for the Tamil Tigers to get overseas funding and support. The United States also began to offer direct aid to the Sri Lankan government, despite its terrible human rights record over the course of the civil war. Public weariness with the fighting led to President Kumaratunga's party losing control of parliament and the election of a new, pro-peace government. Throughout 2002 and 2003, the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers negotiated various ceasefires and signed a Memorandum of Understanding, again mediated by the Norwegians. The two sides compromised with a federal solution, rather than the Tamils' demand for a two-state solution or the government's insistence on a unitary state. Air and ground traffic resumed between Jaffna and the rest of Sri Lanka. However, on October 31, 2003, the Tigers declared themselves in full control of the north and east regions of the country, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency. Within just over a year, monitors from Norway recorded 300 infractions of the ceasefire by the army and 3,000 by the Tamil Tigers. When the Indian Ocean Tsunami hit Sri Lanka on December 26, 2004, it killed 35,000 people and sparked another disagreement between the Tigers and the government over how to distribute aid in Tiger-held areas. On August 12, 2005, the Tamil Tigers lost much of their remaining cachet with the international community when one of their snipers killed Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a highly respected ethnic Tamil who was critical of Tiger tactics. Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran warned that his guerrillas would go on the offensive once more in 2006 if the government failed to implement the peace plan. Fighting erupted again, including the bombing of civilian targets such as packed commuter trains and buses in Colombo. The government also began assassinating pro-Tiger journalists and politicians. Massacres against civilians on both sides left thousands dead over the next few years, including 17 charity workers from France's \"Action Against Hunger,\" who were shot down in their office. On September 4, 2006, the army drove the Tamil Tigers from the key coastal city of Sampur. The Tigers retaliated by bombing a naval convoy, killing more than 100 sailors who were on shore leave. After October 2006 peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, did not produce results, the Sri Lankan government launched a massive offensive in eastern and northern parts of the islands to crush the Tamil Tigers once and for all. The 2007-2009 eastern and northern offensives were extremely bloody, with tens of thousands of civilians caught between the army and Tiger lines. Entire villages were left depopulated and ruined in what a U.N. spokesman termed \"a bloodbath.\" As the government troops closed in on the last rebel strongholds, some Tigers blew themselves up. Others were summarily executed by the soldiers after they surrendered, and these war crimes were captured on video. On May 16, 2009, the Sri Lankan government declared victory over the Tamil Tigers. The following day, an official Tiger website conceded that \"This battle has reached its bitter end.\" People in Sri Lanka and around the world expressed relief that the devastating conflict had finally ended after 26 years, hideous atrocities on both sides, and some 100,000 deaths. The only question remaining is whether the perpetrators of those atrocities will face trials for their crimes.",
        "target_summary": "The Sri Lankan Civil War began due to deep-seated ethnic tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority, exacerbated by British colonial policies favoring Tamils. This conflict developed into a brutal, multi-decade struggle primarily between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The war ultimately concluded in May 2009 with a decisive government military victory over the Tamil Tigers.",

        "title": "Imperfect Choices: A History of the Sri Lankan Economic Crisis",
        "content": "In March 2022, Sri Lanka experienced widespread unrest as a result of the government s failure to contain the historically significant economic crisis. Now that the dust has settled, we can more clearly grasp and analyse the events and causes leading up to the crisis. In this article, Ananay Agarwal examines the economic causes of the problem, along with the most recent agreement between the IMF and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka formally went into default on its debt obligations in April 2022, which marks the official time-period when the situation went from imminent crisis to present crisis. The default immediately resulted in runaway inflation and a shortage of essential supplies like fuel, paper, and food. Shortly thereafter, the Sri Lankan public, frustrated with its political leaders, besieged the President s Mansion in Colombo, leading to iconic images of crowds in the presidential swimming pool. This public outcry and anger forced President Rajapaksa to relinquish his office and paved the way for Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to win the Presidency. As the economy gradually began to improve under Wickremesinghe, the most violent of protests had largely subsided by November 2022. As of writing, a path to resolve the situation and move the country forward has been constructed, and the path is being travelled upon, but the future is still uncertain. Building up to the Economic Crisis: The Post Civil-War Boom When Sri Lanka s civil war came to an end in 2009, the country s economy saw a substantial post-war boom. The economy started to show signs of life as the country s infrastructure was renewed and security was strengthened. This boom, though, turned out be just temporary, and the growth could did not continue for more than three years. The graph below shows that by 2012, the GDP growth rate had dropped significantly, from over 8% to roughly 4% and never fully recovered to the highs of the early 2010s. A small political elite emerged in the years following the civil war, controlling the economy and steering the nation away from pro-growth policies and toward personal gain. Foreign investments had dried up as a result of the conflict, and the new regulations established substantial trade hurdles for foreign corporations to invest in the nation as well as competitive barriers for new domestic firms to emerge without major political backing. Furthermore, with the Great Recession in full swing, prices for Sri Lanka s two main exports   tea and rubber   saw a sharp drop in value, further depressing the post-war boom. White Elephants The term  white elephant  is used to describe a large-scale public investment project that is expensive to create and maintain, but does not produce sufficient economic returns or advantages to justify its cost. In the 2010s, Sri Lanka ended up opting for several such projects with funding from Chinese Banks. These include: 1. Hambantota Port: Located in southern Sri Lanka and funded by Chinese loans, the port was intended to act as a trans-shipment hub before the Malacca Strait. However, the project ballooned in cost, and the Sri Lankan government eventually handed control of the port to China on a 99 year lease. There were also several accusations of corruption, and many Sri Lankans even wondered if the port was ever required in the first place. 2. Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport: Also funded by Chinese banks, this Airport was opened in 2013 and intended to act as a second international airport to serve the capital city of Colombo. Initially many airlines did opt to use it, including Sri Lankan Airlines, but by 2018 all airlines had left. It was even dubbed the  World s Emptiest International Airport  by Forbes magazine due to its low number of passengers and flights, and comparatively gargantuan size. 3. Lotus Tower: The tower is a 350 metres tall telecommunications tower, and has been criticised for its exorbitantly high cost and allegations of scams. Moreover, its location has also been questioned, with broadcasters saying that the tower neither covers all of Sri Lanka, nor improved the quality of current transmissions. 4. Lakvijaya Power Station: Sri Lanka s largest power plant and accounting for nearly 15% of its tower power supply, the station has faced several breakdowns since its inception in 2011. It has been alleged that the government agreed to use sub-standard materials in its agreement, which might be responsible for its frequent failures. 2019 Easter Bombing Over 250 people were killed in a string of Easter-related bombings in three churches and three hotels in Colombo in April 2019. Aside from the horrific loss of life and destruction of property, tourism   one of the main drivers of Sri Lanka s GDP   immediately took a hit. Between 2018 and 2019, spending by international tourists decreased by 16.85%, and between 2019 and 2020, spending decreased by an extraordinary 76.92%. The below graph from MacroTrends shows very clearly that International Tourist spending   which in the 2010s was accounting for 20% of Sri Lankan exports   plummeted in 2019. The decline in tourist arrivals also negatively impacted other sectors of the economy reliant on it like hospitality and transportation. The worst hit were self-employed individuals. Business that had hitherto been operating even during the worst phase of the Civil War were forced to shutter as tourists stayed away. GDP actually declined by 0.2% in 2019, owing chiefly to the Easter Bombings and subsequent Covid outbreak later in the year. Covid-19 Outbreak The outbreak of Covid-19 was an epoch defining event, and the world struggled to overcome it, with Sri Lanka being no exception. However, with an economy heavily reliant on tourists and the export of tea and rubber, the island nation s economy faced an even bleaker time. In conjunction with the Easter Bombings, tourism completely dried up. Hundreds of businesses in Sri Lanka that cater to tourists were forced to shut down as the world went into lockdown and international travel ceased to exist. Additionally, as demand for its main exports declined, so did their prices, which negatively impacted its balance of payments. On the other hand, remittances from Sri Lankans living overseas decreased as more people lost their jobs globally. The pandemic also compelled the government to increase its budgetary expenditure and keep the economy from going down an even darker path. However, the incumbent Rajapaksa government had already slashed taxes in 2019 as a poll-promise, and this policy came back to bite them. The combination of falling revenues and rising spending caused the fiscal deficit to balloon to more than 10% in 2020. In hindsight, this was the first canary in the coal mine that Sri Lanka is in trouble. Overnight Switch to Organic Farming The final nail in the coffin was an almost overnight switch to organic farming. In a bid to address its balance of payments crisis, President Rajapaksa was advised that if the country stopped using imported chemical fertilisers, the import bill would fall and subsequently reduce pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The President began to position himself as an environmental champion and his country a haven for organic farming, and consequently banned   in one fell swoop   all chemical fertilisers from May 2021. Many environmental organisations applauded his decision and praised him as an example to be followed. However, this policy had an extremely detrimental outcome. Farmers were left completely unprepared for the ensuing decline in soil productivity, having little to no notice to prepare them. Food scarcity resulted from the nation s agricultural output falling to an all-time low and consequently, inflation shot through the roof. Ironically, this compelled the nation to import more food, undermining the very rationale behind this policy. In the end, a measure taken to alleviate pressure on forex reserves had the opposite effect and harmed them the most, serving as the proximate cause of the subsequent economic crisis. Historic Dealings with the IMF The International Monetary Fund and Sri Lanka have had extensive dealings since the mid-1960s. In the past 56-year period, approximately 33 years have been spent under the macro-economic management of the IMF, as shown by the graph below. It is to be noted that the IMF fully distributed the agreed funds under 12 of these 16 agreements, with Sri Lanka failing to meet the conditions for the full disbursement of the remainder. The relationship between Sri Lanka and the IMF is multi-faceted and complex, and one should be careful to not attach simplistic  good  or  bad  narratives to both actors. The IMF, with its heavy ideological baggage of adhering to the Washington Consensus, did not always take into account the unique position of Sri Lanka s geography or its institutions. Similarly, Sri Lankan politicians have always been quick to cast the IMF as a neo-colonialist entity and refused to implement policies that are unpopular in the short-term but beneficial for its long-term macro-economic stability. Regardless of the narrative, the fact however is that the Sri Lankan economy has been running on a periodic cycle fuelled by unsustainable debt for decades. The debt is used to finance fiscal and current account deficits, an economic upturn occurs, and politicians kick the proverbial problem down the road to the future generation. Invariably, when the global economy coughs and debts are called in, Sri Lanka catches a cold. The country has unfortunately followed a pattern where it sets out onto the path of fiscal reform to stabilise its economic system, but then reverses direction and fall back into crisis. The 2023 IMF deal On March 20, 2023, the IMF and Sri Lanka signed an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreement to help bring the country out of its economic quagmire. The 48-month arrangement will infuse capital into the country s coffers and allow it to pay for necessary imports like food and fuel. This should give enough policy room to the government led by President Wickremesinghe, to implement structural changes in the economy. The President has also stated the EFF should help increase confidence in the country s economy and allow the government to access another 7 billion USD in funding from other multilateral and international creditors. The IMF immediately released 0.333 billion USD in funds, with more expected to be released in the following months. What is an EFF? The EFF, or Extended Fund Facility is one of IMF s several financial assistance programs, with others being the Stand-By-Arrangement (SBA) and Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI). The choice of program the IMF chooses to utilise depends on the specific needs and problems of the country in question. The EFF is designed to support countries that are facing a balance of payments crisis. It is aimed at helping countries implement long-term structural reforms in their economy so that underlying macro-economic difficulties can be addressed. Under this program, the country in question receives financial assistance in the form of loans or credits for three to four years from the IMF, but with several strings attached. The recipient country is typically required to pass reforms that are aimed at restoring macro-economic stability, reducing fiscal deficits, improving tax collections, reduce government expenditure, and increase productivity and efficiency of state institutions. The official IMF statement has identified four key areas in which reforms are to be implemented   Tax Administration, Public Financial and Expenditure Management, Energy Pricing, and Anti-Corruption Legislation. Tax Administration The last three IMF programs, in addition to the new one in 2023, have primarily focused on addressing the low tax collections of the Sri Lankan government. In December 2019, the government slashed indirect taxes like Value-Added-Taxes (VAT) from 15% to 8%, and the corporate income tax rate from 28% to 24% as poll promises. In addition, other taxes like the nation-building tax of 2%, the Economic Service Charge and PAYE, were also abolished. As a result, Sri Lanka had one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP ratios in 2021. Total tax revenues fell by over 520 million LKR between 2019 and 2020, i.e. nearly 30%. On the flip side, Covid-19 and the Organic Farming fiasco caused an increase in government expenditure by nearly 550 million LKR. This included things like Covid relief assistance through the State Ministry and recruitment of 160,000 unskilled an unemployed graduates. Together, the budget deficit rose by over 100% between 2019 and 2020. The IMF has strongly urged Sri Lanka to implement  progressive  taxes, i.e. charging more tax from the rich, instead of  regressive  taxes, i.e. charging more tax from the poor. Indirect taxes are strongly regressive in nature, since they are taxes paid on the consumption of goods and services. Hence, regardless of income, consumers pay the same tax, implying that poorer people end up spending a greater portion of their income on indirect taxes than wealthier individuals. By adopting more progressive taxes, Sri Lanka should ideally shift away from its heavy reliance on indirect taxes (over 80%) to more sustainable sources of tax income. Public Financial and Expenditure Management The IMF has effectively asked the Sri Lankan government to  tighten its belt  so to speak. It should spend only within its means and cut down on its deficit. A big part of this involves restructuring its external debt obligations from other multilateral and international creditors. This might be in direct reference to the several white elephant projects the country has invested in, many of which have been more hassle than benefit. Sri Lanka needs to consider its long-term finances and act judiciously instead of impulsively funding projects without considering its costs and benefits. Energy Pricing Sri Lanka is significantly dependent on fuel imports from abroad because the country does not possess a significant endowment of hydrocarbons. As a result, supply and demand dynamics on the commodity markets determine energy prices in Sri Lanka. With the Russian-Ukraine war, the cost of coal and oil increased, and Sri Lanka had to pay more to maintain its fuel supply. In order to maintain fuel imports and the island s supply of electricity, the Sri Lankan government started using up its foreign exchange reserves of USD at an unsustainable rate to continue buying fuel in the international market. Eventually, this was no longer feasible, and a decline in resource imports brought about national fuel rationing and electrical shortages. This fuel rationing and electrical shortages made it clear that Sri Lanka and its citizens were at the mercy of uncertain international energy markets. Since the country imports nearly two-thirds of its fuel, the IMF wants Sri Lanka to diversify its energy sector away from hydrocarbons. Shifting to green and renewable sources of energy like wind, solar, or tidal will ensure a more stable supply of electricity to the country and also decrease the pressure on its foreign exchange reserves. Anti-Corruption Legislation The IMF has praised the ongoing efforts of the country in tackling corruption, and asked that they continue and ultimately culminate in revamping anti-corruption legislation. The IMF will also continue conducting the governance diagnostic mission that will assess Sri Lanka s anti-corruption and governance framework. Such governance diagnostic studies have recently been conducted by the IMF in Moldova, the Republic of Congo, Mauritania, and Zambia. The reports on the Republic of Congo, Zambia, Moldova, and Mauritania are all available online. The IMF believes that these analyses are instruments that nations may employ to build strong governance structures and strengthen the rule of law. In all four nations, the IMF teams examined the central bank s governance, the financial and fiscal sectors, the protection of property and contract rights, the tax system, and anti-money laundering systems. It seems clear that the diagnostic framework on Sri Lanka will look at the same items given the press briefing released by the IMF. The diagnostic framework however has been heavily criticised due its strong ideological tinge in neoliberal economics, and been called a propaganda tool to legitimise austerity. The fact that the Sri Lankan government has currently authorized the sale of a number of profitable State-Owned Companies is particularly pertinent to notice. This choice has most likely been made under pressure from the IMF that believes that governments shouldn t become involved in business. Regardless, the authorisation of these sales encouraged strikes by labour unions and in turn triggered the outlawing of strikes by the government. Conclusion With the benefit of hindsight, it is not unreasonable to say that the current crisis is a repeat of a historical pattern that has regularly played out in Sri Lanka. This time however, the crisis has been particularly acute and there is a very real chance that Sri Lanka can veer off its debt fuelled trajectory. The way forward for Sri Lanka lies in making imperfect policy choices. Firstly, significant hikes in taxation, particularly indirect taxes like VAT, will disproportionately affect the poor and less well-off, at a time when they are already facing the brunt of the crisis. However, high tax collections is one of the conditions that the IMF has imposed, and indeed greater revenue will certainly create a healthier economy in the longer term. Secondly, the government must also spend only within its means, but this will certainly reduce the societal benefits it provides to its citizens. It is thus unclear how Sri Lanka will accomplish the IMF s simultaneous demands for  expenditure management  and an increase in social benefits. Thirdly, diversifying away from hydrocarbons to green energy might sound good on paper, but has the potential to make Sri Lanka even more reliant on weather patterns and the monsoons, since these will then directly affect its energy production. Lastly, while corruption is a menace in Sri Lankan society and certainly needs to be combatted, there is a case to be made that the IMF is no moral superman, and its diagnostic framework a tool to legitimise its authority and ideology. The most likely conclusion is that Sri Lanka recovers from the crisis  better than before,  with the likelihood of the two extremes reverting to previous behaviours or becoming a wholly different Sri Lanka being far lower.

        "target_summary": "Sri Lanka experienced a severe economic crisis beginning in March 2022, leading to a debt default in April, widespread essential shortages, high inflation, and public unrest that forced President Rajapaksa's resignation. This crisis was triggered by multiple factors, including unsustainable \"white elephant\" infrastructure projects, a collapse in tourism after the 2019 Easter bombings and COVID-19, and a detrimental overnight ban on chemical fertilizers in 2021. To address the situation, Sri Lanka signed a 48-month Extended Fund Facility agreement with the IMF in March 2023, aimed at providing financial aid and implementing structural reforms in tax administration, public expenditure, energy pricing, and anti-corruption.",

        "title": "The Sri Lankan Civil War and Its History, Revisited in 2020",
        "content": "On June 9, 2020, Sri Lankans occupied the streets outside the US Embassy in Sri Lanka s capital, Colombo, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, holding signs condemning the racism, police brutality, and other maladies plaguing the United States. Sri Lanka s social issues also came to light at this protest. The country, after all, has its history of ethnic strife and is currently mending after the end of a long, brutal civil war. As the nation attempts to heal, Sri Lanka continues to sustain new injuries to its social and political structures that reveal much larger systemic problems. Police arrived at the demonstration and violently dispersed protesters arresting at least 53 individuals supposedly to enforce public health restrictions related to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the police s ferocity was unsettling. Some footage, for instance,  showed a young woman being tossed into a police vehicle, head first.  One of the protest s organizers, Pubudu Jayagoda, indicated that the Sri Lankan government had been  downplaying coronavirus health risks,  implying that the police perhaps had ulterior motives and revealing his disillusionment with the government s policing power. Such growing disenchantment with the Sri Lankan government represents just one problem amongst the country's history of ethnic tensions. Sri Lanka s present is haunted by memories of the island s decades-long civil war, which began in 1983 and ended just over 10 years ago. The war was mainly a clash between the Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) insurgent group, the latter of which had hoped to establish a separate state for the Tamil minority. The mainstream narrative suggests that the civil war was derived from tensions between the Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic groups. However, the war also represented the legacy of British imperialism. This alternative analysis suggests that the ethnic conflicts were symptoms of a much larger problem, rejecting the oversimplified narrative that Sri Lanka is home to a people that are perpetually clashing with one another due to ethnic incompatibilities. Instead, the analysis surrounding the legacy of British imperialism embraces the idea that Sri Lanka s conflict has much to do with each group fighting to reclaim its dignity and power, albeit at the expense of the other. A post-colonial analysis reveals that both the Sinhalese and Tamils acted to recover what they believed they had lost during their respective golden eras, imperial rule for the Sinhalese and shortly after for the Tamils. Present moments like the June 9th protest are no longer surprising and clearly align with Sri Lanka s broader history under this interpretation. Perhaps more importantly, this post-colonial narrative suggests that Sri Lanka s conflicts are not in the past; rather, the conflicts continue to manifest through the government s leadership in moments much like the Colombo protests. An Origin Story Sri Lanka is 74.9 percent Sinhalese and 11.2 percent Sri Lankan Tamil. Within these two groups, Sinhalese tend to be Buddhist and Tamils tend to be Hindu, displaying significant linguistic and religious divisions. However, the strife between the grounds purportedly began much further back in Sri Lanka s ancient settlement history. Though the Sinhalese people s arrival in Sri Lanka is somewhat ambiguous, historians believe that the Tamils arrived on the island both as invaders and traders from India s Chola Kingdom. These origin stories suggest that the Sinhalese and Tamil communities have experienced tension from the very beginning not out of cultural incompatibility, but rather out of power disputes. During British imperial rule, the tensions between the two groups worsened. The CIA suggested in 1985 that the Sinhalese community felt threatened by the Tamil group s prosperity partly due to the British favoritism of Tamils during the British occupation of Sri Lanka. Because Tamil communities also existed in several other British colonies like India, South Africa, and Singapore, Sri Lankan Tamils benefited from broader commercial networks and a wider range of opportunities. Moreover, British colonial authorities often placed English language schools in predominantly Tamil areas, providing Tamils with more civil service and professional opportunities than their Sinhalese counterparts. This pattern of Tamil favoritism left Sinhalese people feeling isolated and oppressed. Despite the tension between these groups before British colonization, the events that followed Sri Lankan independence suggest that imperial rule had provoked the ensuing conflict. Indeed, soon after British occupiers left the island in 1948, these patterns of Tamil dominance changed dramatically. The Story Reverses After British independence, many Sinhalese worked their way into the upper echelons of government. These Sinhalese gained power and went on to gradually pass acts effectively disenfranchising their Tamil counterparts. One such act was the Sinhala Only Act, a 1956 bill that made Sinhala the only official language of Sri Lanka and created barriers for Tamil people trying to access government services or seeking public employment. Former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga frames the act, which her father passed, as a move to nurture and reclaim a Sri Lankan identity following an extended period of British rule. If Kumaratunga s statements about her father s legislation are sincere and accurate, her commentary may reveal that legislators at the time hoped to recover the dignity of their Sinhalese ethnicity that they felt was lost during British imperial rule not that they wanted to actively minimize Tamil culture. Retrospectively, though, the minimization of Tamil culture is precisely what the laws accomplished. Another pertinent policy was that of standardization, which aimed to provide more educational opportunities for disadvantaged Sinhalese students. The policy required Tamil students to achieve higher exam scores that their Sinhalese counterparts in order to be admitted Sri Lankan universities. Legislators created a program that resembled affirmative action for the Sinhalese, who lacked opportunities and were disadvantaged during British imperial rule. Yet, when coupled with the Sinhala Only Act, standardization took opportunities from Tamil students, several of whom had turned to educational avenues to compensate for their lack of professional civil service opportunities. Thus, this legislation passed by a Sinhalese-dominated government failed to level the playing field; instead, it tilted the odds in the other direction and effectively discriminated against Tamil students. Ostensibly, these ethnic frictions had roots in the social destabilization caused by British occupation, and had more to do with reclaiming Sinhalese power and dignity than to cultural tensions between the Tamils and Sinhalese. Even so, before long, a few militant Sri Lankan Tamils organized an insurgency. The War Itself Some Tamils responded to these discriminatory policies with the idea of Tamil Eelam, a separate state for Tamils. While the idea appears to be extreme, the two groups already lived in somewhat separate spheres of the country: the Sinhalese in Southern, Western, and Central Sri Lanka, and the Tamils in the Northern and Eastern parts of the island. Tamil Eelam aimed to formalize this existing geographic separation. The movement was built on the idea that Tamils and Sinhalese represented distinct ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. However, post-colonial thought would suggest that the underlying reasons for both Sinhalese and Tamil actions in the immediate post-colonial period were not due to untenable differences, but rather a desire for power across the country s communities and a feeling of frustration about the lack of opportunity caused by factors beyond the groups  control. Nonetheless, Tamils had mixed reactions to the concept of Eelam. While a handful of groups supported Tamil Eelam, only one prevailed: the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). LTTE destroyed other budding Eelam groups like the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) to become the  sole representative of the Tamils.  The conflict then escalated into civil war. The war officially began after a day of riots targeting Tamils in Colombo in July 1983, a month which has since been dubbed  Black July.  The fighting lasted just under three decades and ended in May 2009, when the Sri Lankan government announced that they killed the LTTE leader. LTTE was an uncompromising group inspired by Che Guevarra and his guerilla warfare tactics. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) soon labeled the LTTE a terrorist group after they initiated terror tactics including suicide bombers, the suicide belt, and female-led suicide attacks. The group even assassinated two world leaders: Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Indeed, the LTTE s activities extended beyond Sri Lanka s borders. However, LTTE was not the only perpetrator of heinous crimes during the Sri Lankan Civil War. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights determined that the Sinhalese-dominated government has also been implicated in war crimes such as the torture of war prisoners and citizen disappearances. In one notably brutal example, the government s forces murdered five Tamil students in the port city of Trincomalee. These conflicts, rooted in a quest for power and dignity, descended into brutal violence on both sides, and memories of this violence still haunt the country today. The Situation Now and the Protests Revisited Although the Civil War ended in 2009, the current situation in Sri Lanka has only partially improved. A large portion of the Tamil population remains displaced. While there are fewer political and civil rights issues, instances of torture and enforced disappearances persist even in recent years. Moreover, the Sri Lankan government often surveils and tracks people linked to LTTE. The Sri Lankan military still occupies predominantly Tamil areas designated as  high-security zones,  though to a lesser extent than during the war. The government s Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) targets mostly Tamils. In a more subtle sense, the Sri Lankan government continues to disenfranchise the Tamil community. Through the process of  Sinhalization,  for instance, Sinhalese culture has slowly replaced that of the Tamil population. Sinahlese monuments, road signs, street and village names, as well as Buddhist places of worship became more common in predominantly Tamil areas. These efforts have infringed upon, and in some cases even erased, the Tamil perspective on Sri Lankan history, as well as Tamil and Hindu elements of the country s culture. Photo by Agnieszka Kowalczyk / Unsplash Perhaps the conflict has devolved into an ethnic issue, but it did not start that way. It may not stay that way either. The Sri Lankan government has alienated the Tamil minority since the civil war ended, but, more recently, it has come to disappoint its Sinhalese constituency as well. The government's actions since the end of the civil war have become increasingly undemocratic for Tamils and Sinhalese alike. Its response to the Black Lives Matter protests, for example, was only the latest instance in which the government exercised an unprecedented amount of power. The Sri Lankan government began growing its power during the civil war a conflict that stemmed from ethnic tensions rooted in the legacy of British imperialism on the island. The government continues to expand its authority now many years later. What this means for the future of Sri Lanka is unclear. Still, one thing is for sure: even if the wounds caused by the Sri Lankan Civil War and its accompanying ethnic divisions heal, the country will remain haunted by much larger structural issues in its history and government. However, a unified citizenry in Sri Lanka could be a powerful tool in responding to its government s growing power. Ethnic unity on the island may be the key to a more secure future.",

        "title": "Forty years since the beginning of civil war in Sri Lanka",
        "content": "Forty years ago, in the last days of July 1983, Sinhala chauvinist thugs backed by the United National Party (UNP) government and security forces unleashed a pogrom against Tamils in Colombo and other areas of Sri Lanka. It triggered the 26-year communal war by successive governments against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Burned out Tamil businesses in the Pettha area of downtown Colombo, Sri Lanka on Aug. 1, 1983. More than 1,000 businesses and homes of Tamil's were destroyed in the racial riots. [AP Photo/JLR] The war took hundreds of thousands of lives Tamil, Sinhala and Muslim and devastated the living conditions of many more, mainly of the Tamil minority in the north and east of the island. The conflict came to a bloody end in May 2009 with the military crushing of the LTTE and the slaughter of tens of thousands of Tamil civilians. The protracted civil war contains important strategic lessons for the working class in Sri Lanka and internationally. Though the war ended 14 years ago, the political issues that led to the conflict have not been resolved and continue to fester. The carnage carried out against Tamils 40 years ago was triggered by the death of 13 Sri Lankan soldiers who were killed by the LTTE in an ambush on July 23, 1983. With the approval of the government, the military brought the bodies to Colombo the same day, furnishing the pretext for the anti-Tamil violence. Well-organised thugs armed with guns, explosives, axes, knives and sticks, and provided with electoral lists, targeted Tamil homes and businesses. The gangs acted with the full backing of the UNP government of President J.R. Jayawardene. Some ministers were implicated in organising and directing the attacks. The armed forces and police either participated directly in the violence, or turned a blind eye. Officially, the number killed was 300, but the real figure is at least a thousand. Hundreds of Tamil women were raped. More than 250,000 people were displaced. In Colombo s Welikada jail, 52 Tamil prisoners were massacred with the connivance of prison officials. Thousands of homes and shops owned by Tamils were burned and destroyed. President Jayawardene appeared on national TV on July 28 and justified the communal pogroms.  Because of the violence by the terrorists, the Sinhalese people themselves have reacted,  Jayawardene stated. He declared that the government had decided to proscribe organisations advocating the division of the country, adding that  this is the only way to appease the natural desire and request of the Sinhala people.  On August 4, the government enacted the sixth constitutional amendment banning political parties that did not take an oath of allegiance to the  unitary state  from entering parliament or local government bodies. Every state employee was ordered to take a similar oath on pain of dismissal. The North and East were formally declared war zones and  strategies for military operations  in these provinces were drawn up and initiated by army commander Major General Tissa Weeratunga. The 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom did not come out of the blue. Confronted with widespread opposition among workers to its open market policies, the Jayawardene government resorted to the reactionary stock-in-trade of the Colombo political establishment the whipping up of anti-Tamil chauvinism and violence to divide the working class. Sri Lanka was one of the first countries in the world to end the policy of national economic regulation and import substitution and adopt a free market program. Amid a deep economic crisis, the Jayawardene government that came to power in 1977 devalued the rupee and began to shut down or privatise state-owned enterprises, slash spending on essential social services and cut back price subsidies on basic food items such as rice and flour. The consequences for workers and the urban and rural poor were devastating and provoked a growing number of strikes and protests. In July 1980, public sector workers launched a general strike, demanding a 300-rupee wage hike, to which the government responded by sacking 100,000 employees. The strike was ultimately crushed after the main working-class parties the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), the Stalinist Communist Party (CP) and the centrist Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP) refused to wage a political struggle to bring down the UNP government. To counter the widespread opposition, Jayawardene escalated the anti-Tamil campaign that had already led to violent attacks throughout the island, including on Tamil workers in the plantation districts. More than 100 had been killed and nearly 100,000 had been forced to flee their homes. In June 1981, thugs mobilised from Colombo, with the support of security forces and the police, went on a rampage in the northern town of Jaffna, setting fire to the Jaffna Public Library, which had stored valuable books, including irreplaceable manuscripts. Then came the July 1983 pogrom and the war. The Jayawardene government s resort to anti-Tamil chauvinism can be traced to the foundations of the Sri Lankan state, formed after formal independence from British colonial rule in 1948. The ruling class had faced the development of class struggles in the final years of British rule following World War II, particularly by plantation workers, including general strikes in 1946 and 1947. One of the first actions of the UNP government that took power in 1948 was to abolish the citizenship and voting rights of hundreds of thousands of Tamil workers brought from India as indentured labour to work in the plantations. The aim was to divide the working class on ethnic lines and weaken it. However, the Trotskyists of the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India (BLPI), the Ceylonese section of the Fourth International, which had played a leading role in the general strikes, opposed the Citizenship Act and fought tenaciously for the unity of the working class. Colvin R de Silva [Photo: Wikipedia] In the parliamentary debate, BLPI leader Colvin R de Silva condemned the dangerous fascistic principle on which the Act was based, namely  that the state must be coeval with the nation and the nation with the race.  He warned that though the Tamils in the North and East had not been targeted by the Act, it was  not only a short but easy step,  once the racialist principle was adopted as the basis for the Sri Lankan state. The warning was rapidly confirmed. In 1953, the UNP government was brought to its knees by a profound economic and political crisis that had provoked a nation-wide hartal strikes and business closures that united working people across communal lines. The response of the ruling class was to turn to the newly formed Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), which came to power in 1956 on the basis of an openly Sinhala-chauvinist program dressed up with socialistic phrase-mongering. The SLFP-led government implemented its policy of making Sinhala the country s only official language, severely disadvantaging Tamils, including many public servants who lost their jobs. The roots of the civil war that erupted in 1983 lie not simply in the anti-Tamil chauvinism in which the Colombo ruling class is mired, but in the liquidation of the BLPI into the centrist LSSP in 1950 and the LSSP s subsequent political backsliding and adaptation to Sinhala populism and the SLFP. In 1964, the LSSP completely abandoned any adherence to socialist internationalism and joined the bourgeois SLFP-led government of Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike. The LSSP s great betrayal was aided and abetted by the revisionist tendency within the Fourth International led by Michel Pablo and Ernest Mandel that rejected the revolutionary role of the working class and sought to subordinate it to the Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, social democratic parties and bourgeois nationalist forces like the SLFP in countries such as Sri Lanka. The International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) was formed in 1953 in a break from the Pabloites to defend genuine Trotskyism. The LSSP s betrayal generated great confusion and disorientation within the working class. It opened the door for various petty-bourgeois radical groups based on communal politics. In the south, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was formed in 1966 on an eclectic mixture of Maoism, Castroism and Sinhala populism and gained a base among oppressed rural youth. In 1972, the SLFP-LSSP-CP coalition government brought in a new constitution, drawn up by attorney-general and LSSP leader Colvin R de Silva, that formally enshrined Buddhism as the state religion, along with the Sinhala-only language policy. It also enacted discriminatory measures against Tamils in public sector employment and for university entrance. Tamil youth in the north deserted the traditional Tamil bourgeois parties in droves and embraced various Tamil groups including the LTTE that advocated the armed struggle for a separate Tamil state. A group of youth who had opposed the LSSP s betrayal formed the Revolutionary Communist League (RCL), the predecessor of the Socialist Equality Party, in 1968, as the Sri Lankan section of the ICFI. RCL General Secretary Keerthi Balasuriya addressing an RCL meeting in early 1970. Tragically, Comrade Balasuriya died in 1987 at the age of just 39. The RCL alone championed the program of socialist internationalism, opposed all forms of communal politics and fought for the unity of the working class Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim. When conflict finally erupted in 1983, the RCL was the only party that consistently opposed the war, defended the democratic rights of Tamils and demanded the unconditional withdrawal of the Sri Lankan army from the North and East. The 26-year war is an indictment against the Sri Lankan ruling class and a confirmation of Leon Trotsky s Theory of Permanent Revolution. Trotsky demonstrated that the bourgeoisie in countries of belated capitalist development are organically incapable of meeting the democratic and social aspirations of the masses. That task falls to the working class as part of the struggle for a workers  and peasants  government to implement socialist politics and the fight for socialism internationally. The war also graphically exposed the LTTE s separatist policy that sought to carve out a separate state of Eelam in the North and East of the island with the support of India. Despite its various socialistic phrases, the LTTE s call for a separate state represented the interests of the Tamil bourgeoisie that sought an arena to profiteer from the exploitation of Tamil workers. The LTTE s promotion of illusions in the Indian bourgeoisie was exposed in July 1987 when the Indian government reached an agreement the Indo-Lanka Accord to bail out the crisis-ridden Jayawardene regime. The LTTE backed the Accord under which India sent  peace-keeping  troops into northern Sri Lanka to disarm Tamil armed groups on the promise of limited provincial autonomy. The Accord allowed Jayawardene to send his army to crush the rural unrest in the south. The LTTE s support for the Accord reflected deeper processes internationally that were undermining so-called national liberation movements. The globalisation of production in the 1980s had undermined all programs based on national economic regulation, most clearly revealed in the collapse of the Stalinist regimes in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The LTTE increasingly dropped its socialist window dressing and anti-imperialist rhetoric and turned to the major powers to assist in setting up a separate state where foreign capital could exploit cheap Tamil labour. As part of the broader discussion in the ICFI, the RCL, which had advocated the  right of self-determination for the Tamil people,  as a means of unifying Tamil and Sinhala workers, concluded that the slogan no longer had any progressive content. While continuing to demand the immediate withdrawal of Sri Lankan armed forces from the North and East, our party advanced the call for a Sri Lanka-Eelam Socialist Republic as part of a Union of Socialist Republics in South Asia and internationally. While the communal war dragged on until 2009, the LTTE s separatist perspective resulted in its increasing isolation. It blamed the Sinhala masses for the crimes of the Sri Lankan military and attacked innocent Sinhalese people, which only strengthened the hand of the Colombo government. In the North and East, the LTTE increasingly alienated Tamil working people through its oppressive and anti-democratic rule. The LTTE s defeat was not just a military catastrophe but demonstrated the bankruptcy of its political program. As the Sri Lankan military closed in for the kill, the LTTE was incapable of appealing to the working class in Sri Lanka, let alone India and internationally, for support. Instead, it continued to issue futile appeals to the  international community that is, to major powers such as the US and India which had been backing Colombo s war politically and militarily. None of the issues of the protracted civil war have been resolved. The Sri Lankan army maintains its heavy-handed occupation of the North and East, the basic democratic rights of Tamils continue to be trampled on, and, amid an unprecedented economic crisis, communal tensions are again being whipped up. The government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe is implementing harsh austerity measures dictated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It is facing widespread opposition and unrest among workers and the rural masses Sinhala and Tamil alike. In a desperate attempt to stabilise his government, Wickremesinghe is seeking the support of bourgeois Tamil parliamentary parties by offering greater power-sharing for provincial councils. Anti-Tamil communalism has immediately raised its ugly head in Colombo. Sinhala chauvinist groups have already launched a campaign denouncing Wickremesinghe for preparing to divide the country by giving more power to the Tamils. In early August, the former army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Jagath Dias, addressed a Sinhala chauvinist gathering at a Buddhist centre in Colombo, where he claimed that  a plan is underway to help establish Eelam by constitutional means.  The Island, which reported the meeting and is notorious for boosting Sinhala chauvinist groups, declared that Dias would spearhead a campaign against greater provincial autonomy. Another Sinhala extremist group, the National Freedom Front, has accused Wickremesinghe of seeking the  Indianisation of the country  through its economic agreements with New Delhi. Sagara Kariyawasam, secretary of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), on which Wickremesinghe relies for parliamentary support, has warned the president against prioritising discussions on more powers to provincial councils. The whole history of Sri Lanka, particularly the brutal civil war that devastated the island, constitutes a sharp warning to the working class that its class interests for decent, well-paid jobs, social services and living conditions cannot be met through divisive communal politics. Instead, what is desperately needed is a unified struggle of workers, mobilising the downtrodden rural toilers, against the capitalist system and all its defenders, including the trade unions. The Socialist Equality Party calls on workers to form their own democratically elected action committees, independent of all capitalist parties, in every workplace and rural area to fight for their basic democratic and social rights. We are campaigning for a Democratic and Socialist Congress of Workers and Rural Masses based on the representatives of the action committees to take up the fight for a workers  and peasants  government to abolish all forms of communal discrimination, repressive laws and to implement socialist policies.",

        "content": "Perhaps the most informative and convenient way to get around is on the new double decker City Sightseeing bus, launched in February 2013, which delivers historical commentary as it travels the streets of downtown Jo burg and beyond. Make sure to stop off at Constitution Hill: today, this is the site of the South African Constitutional Court, but visitors will also learn about a rather less cheery era in the country s history. Its Old Fort is a former prison that operated from pre-Boer War times in the late 19th Century and throughout the apartheid era until its closure in 1987. Mandela spent short stints here in 1956 and 1962 while awaiting trial, and although the cells he occupied have since been demolished, a recreated one contains a permanent exhibition documenting his stay both here and on Cape Town s Robben Island, largely through correspondence written during his incarceration. The one-time prison also offers a chilling look at the apartheid regime, where deep racial inequalities permeated even the penal system. The sightseeing bus then takes you on an equally emotional ride to the excellent Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg South, where the exhibition is as superbly moving as it is distressing. Understanding the political system that ruled South Africa from 1948 to 1994 is essential to understanding Mandela himself, and a couple of hours spent walking through recent history will help untangle the extent of the complex web of laws that segregated every aspect of South African society. Throughout the 1950s and  60s, Mandela s home was a simple dwelling on Vilakazi Street in Soweto, a thriving suburb 30km southwest of Johannesburg   though his underground political activities meant that he spent little time here with wife Winnie and their two daughters. Today, the house is preserved as a museum, and while the information panels go a long way to explaining this era in Mandela s life, it is the impassioned guided tours that make this a must-see stop. In those final years before his lengthy incarceration (1962 to 1990), Mandela also spent time in a farmhouse 28km to the north of the city. In the 1960s, Liliesleaf Farm was the headquarters of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the then-banned ANC. Today it has been transformed into a magnificent museum, where interactive exhibits draw visitors into a fascinating chapter in South African history. Information is abundant, so be sure to set aside half a day to fully appreciate the role that Liliesleaf played in the resistance movement. Cape Town and around: Imprisonment and freedom (1964 to 1990) After the Rivonia Trial, which began with the Liliesleaf raid in 1963 and wrapped up in 1964, in which 10 leaders of the ANC were tried for acts of sabotage designed to overthrow the apartheid system, Mandela was moved to Robben Island, South Africa s answer to Alcatraz. Lying 7km off Cape Town s coast, the island served as a jail, a leper colony and a World War II fortification before returning to its roots in 1961 as a maximum security prison with virtually no chance of escape. Today the building is a museum, and it s is one of the main attractions in a city awash with activities and sights. Board a ferry at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront for the half day trip that takes in the choppy seas, tours the island and makes an all-important stop at the cell that held prisoner 46664 for much of his 27 years behind bars. Towards the end of his incarceration, Mandela was moved between prisons in the Cape. Both Pollsmoor Prison and Drakenstein Correctional Centre (formerly Victor Verster Prison) remain in use, and the latter, 70km east of Cape Town in the Winelands, is worth a visit. It is here that Mandela spent his final days of imprisonment and where the memorable scenes of him walking free for the first time in almost three decades were shot. A bronze statue of the great man, hand raised in triumph, commemorates the moment. If you re lucky, you might find a warden to take you on a quick unofficial tour of the cottage where he spent his final years of captivity. Back in Cape Town, there is one more sight to see: the Edwardian City Hall facade overlooking Grand Parade. This large square is home to a daily bustling market, but on 11 February 1990, thousands gathered in this spot to hear Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela speak from the balcony as a free man for the first time in more than 27 years. Visit on a Sunday when the square is quieter and ponder the life of a man who epitomised forgiveness and reconciliation, and inspired not only a nation, but the rest of the world as well.",

In the autumn of 1608, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, the most original Italian painter of the 17th Century, was on the run. Tempestuous and arrogant, Caravaggio was forever getting into brawls. He swaggered about with a sword at his side and once flung a plate of scalding artichokes in the face of a waiter, supposedly because some of them were cooked in butter rather than oil. Yet even by his own combustible standards two years earlier he had crossed a line, when he killed a man in a quarrel over a gambling debt at a tennis match. Before he could be charged with murder, he fled Rome and spent the rest of his short life as a fugitive from justice. That autumn in 1608, following spells in Naples and Malta, he arrived in Sicily. He stayed on the island for around a year, sleeping fitfully with a dagger by his side, and painting several late masterpieces, including the Nativity with San Lorenzo and San Francesco.",

Built between the 12th and 13th Centuries during a period of Venetian occupation, the castle was once called  the eye of Crete ; views from the top allow visitors to see the Ionian, Aegean and Cretan seas simultaneously. Today, the castle   the former residence of the Venetian governor   houses the historical archives of Cythera. Also in sight is the town of Kapsali, which served as the capital s port during Venetian times. Located just 2km south of Chora, Kapsali is characterised by a curved waterfront and sandy twin bays where sea turtles are known to swim. Kapsali is just one of many villages that dot Cythera s shoreline, with one of the most well known among locals being picturesque Avlemonas, a charming and historic hamlet situated some 18km northeast of Chora that you can reach by crossing Katouni Bridge. A reminder of British rule, the stone bridge  the largest of its kind in Greece at 110m long and 6m wide   was completed in 1826 as part of a project to ensure ease of travel between the seaside village and Chora   or so official records say. Legend has it that the construction was driven by desire: after Cythera s British governor fell in love with a girl from a nearby village, he decided to build this bridge near her house in order to see her daily. Another large relic backed by lore is the Panagia Myrtidiotissa monastery, the largest in Cythera. Situated on the western side of the island near the village of Kalokerines, the monastery   which translates to  The Most Holy Virgin Mary of the Myrtle Trees    was built next to a myrtle tree where a shepherd, according to legend, found a holy icon of the Virgin Mary in the 14th Century. Pilgrims travel here to venerate the icon on 15 August s Feast of the Dormition and on 24 September, the day of its finding. The icon is the patron saint of all Kytherians and is on display in the monastery save for Easter, when there is a religious procession to transfer it to Chora. An island for nature lovers Whittled away by wind and sea, Cythera is generously composed of steep, rocky cliffs and deep bays   and all of these elements are on display in the lush village of Mylopotamos, situated approximately 13km northwest of Chora. Meaning  mill on the river  in Greek, the village was once home to 22 watermills used for grinding wheat. Today, only one renovated mill remains, situated near the island s notorious 20m waterfall, Neraida, which is a fount of folklore. Also known as Fonissa ( female killer ), the waterfall was reputedly the site of a murder: legend has it that two women were fighting atop the waterfall when one pushed the other over the edge. Many hiking paths originate by the Neraida waterfall and loop through the village, incorporating a variety of cultural and scenic elements that illustrate Cythera s combination of natural beauty and historical significance. Hikers can follow one such monopati (a one-person path often used for donkeys)   recently signposted with numbers and arrows   that loops 2.6km past ruins of old mills and back to the town, though the more intrepid can choose to break away from the path before it loops back up and descend 2.2km down steep rocks and through the gorge to Kalami Beach, which can only be reached on foot by climbing down the rocks or through the gorge. Another scenic hike starts in the cypress forests of Lourantianika, in the island s southern region, and passes 4.6km through wild olive trees while affording spectacular views of Chora, the Kastro and the sea. Such discoveries of isolated beauty remain standard on Cythera, said Fivos Tsaravopoulos, programme coordinator of the Kythera Hiking Project, an organization centred around the creation of trails and sustainable tourism on the island.  Cythera is a small paradise for walking,  he said.  It combines incredible landscapes   forests, waterfalls, cliffs, gorges, beaches and a Mediterranean desert   and picturesque villages, beautiful churches on the top of mountains and an incredible amount of wildflowers.",

Arthur Rimbaud called absinthe the  sagebrush of the glaciers  because a key ingredient, the bitter-tasting herb Artemisia absinthium or wormwood, is plentiful in the icy Val-de-Travers region of Switzerland. That is where the legendary aromatic drink that came to symbolise decadence was invented in the late 18th Century. It s hard to overstate absinthe s cultural impact   or imagine a contemporary equivalent. The spirit was a muse extraordinaire from 1859, when  douard Manet s The Absinthe Drinker shocked the annual Salon de Paris, to 1914, when Pablo Picasso created his painted bronze sculpture, The Glass of Absinthe. During the Belle  poque, the Green Fairy   nicknamed after its distinctive colour   was the drink of choice for so many writers and artists in Paris that five o clock was known as the Green Hour, a happy hour when cafes filled with drinkers sitting with glasses of the verdant liquor. Absinthe solidified or destroyed friendships, and created visions and dream-like states that filtered into artistic work. It shaped Symbolism, Surrealism, Modernism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and Cubism. Dozens of artists took as their subjects absinthe drinkers and the ritual paraphernalia: a glass, slotted spoon, sugar cubes   sugar softened the bitter bite of cheaper brands   and fountains dripping cold water to dilute the liquor. Absinthe was, at its conception, not unlike other medicinal herbal preparations (vermouth, the German word for wormwood, among them). Its licorice flavor derived from fennel and anise. But this was an aperitif capable of creating blackouts, pass-outs, hallucinations and bizarre behaviour. Contemporary analysis indicates that the chemical thujone in wormwood was present in such minute quantities in properly distilled absinthe as to cause little psychoactive effect. It s more likely that the damage was done by severe alcohol poisoning from drinking twelve to twenty shots a day. Still, the mystique remains. Muse in a bottle",

        "content": "After 700 years, Lalibela s 11 Unesco-listed churches may be meeting their greatest foe: travellers. After the 1991 fall of dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam made Ethiopia more amenable to visitors, hardy tourists started to make their way to the remote town of Lalibela, perched in Ethiopia s Lasta mountains at 2,600m. The town is home to 11 medieval rock-cut churches so revered, Unesco included them on the original World Heritage list in 1978   a list of then only 12 sites, which now has grown to 981. Yet as more travellers have followed, some are starting to worry that increased commercialisation is eroding the area s unique atmosphere. According to local history, Lalibela s churches were the grand project of early 13th-century King Lalibela, although archaeologists believe that some of the churches, including the imposing Bet Gebriel-Rafael and the nearby Bet Mercurios, were built five centuries earlier, under the rule of the Axumite Empire. Arguably the most spectacular of Lalibela s churches is Bet Giyorgis (St George). The church lies in a hole some 15m deep, putting its cruciform roof roughly at ground level. Giyorgis has no bricks, no blocks, no evidence of joins. Instead, the church is carved out of a single solid piece of pink rock. The 13th-century labourers who built it dug down into an outcrop, carving a trench around a single massive block, and then hewed the church from that monolith. Visiting the church may be a priceless experience, especially in mid-January during Timkat (Epiphany), when thousands of Ethiopian white-clad worshippers, as well as tourists, descend on the churches. But tourists have been grumbling since the fee to see the churches tripled in 2013 from 350 birr to 950 birr, a ticket that covers all 11 churches and is good for four days.  It was a shocker,  said Priscilla Champaneri, who was visiting from New Zealand.  I was thinking it would be $20 (385 birr) maximum.

        "title": "Does Sigmund Freud still matter?",
        "content": "Psychoanalytic theory has changed a lot in the 75 years since his death, but literature still feels the strong influence of Freud's ideas, argues Jane Ciabattari. Freudian slips. The Oedipus complex. The ego. The id. The superego. Sigmund Freud s writings changed how we perceive human behaviour. The founder of psychoanalysis pioneered insights into perhaps the original unreliable narrator   the self   and opened the pathway toward increasingly complex literary characters with motives beyond the obvious.  Every dream will reveal itself as a psychological structure, full of significance, and one which may be assigned to a specific place in the psychic activities of the waking state,  Freud wrote in his landmark book, The Interpretation of Dreams, published in 1899. From the beginning, his work was intertwined with the canonical literature of his time. He drew upon Sophocles, Goethe s Faust and Shakespeare   especially Hamlet, King Lear and Macbeth   to explicate his understanding of unconscious motivations and the complex metaphors and displacements of dreams. He used the language of poets and novelists to outline irrational behaviour, pioneering concepts we have come to think of as commonplace. To begin to understand Freud s enduring impact on literature today, it is illuminating to trace the parallels between his writings and the work of his literary contemporaries. Peer pressure and praise  When I read one of your beautiful works I keep finding, behind the fiction, the same propositions, interests and solutions that are familiar to me from my own thoughts,  Freud wrote to Arthur Schnitzler, whose sexually explicit work, including the 1897 play Reigen (best known as La Ronde) was banned in Austria for nearly a quarter century. Schnitzler was, like Freud, trained as a neurologist in Vienna. And he was familiar with The Interpretation of Dreams. Schnitzler s fiction includes dreams, Freudian symbols (mountains, lakes) and stream-of-consciousness, modelled on the  free association  Freud describes in Studies on Hysteria (1895). Freud also corresponded with Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig, who noted in his 1931 biographical essay about the psychoanalyst,  Twenty years ago, Freud s ideas were still thought of as blasphemous and heretical. Today they circulate freely and find expression in ordinary linguistic usage.  Freud s psychoanalytic theories and emphasis on the unconscious have shaped decades of conflicted characters. His theory of the Oedipus complex underpins many a literary work, from the incestuous relationship between Paul Morel and his mother in DH Lawrence s 1913 novel Sons and Lovers to the present. Freud s work with traumatised World War I soldiers led to Beyond the Pleasure Principle, which fed into the character of Septimus Smith in Virginia Woolf s Mrs Dalloway (1925). The modernist poet HD sought out Freud in 1933 when she was suffering from writer s block, triggered in part by her dread of another devastating world war. Her 1956 book, Tribute to Freud, is a memoir of her psychoanalytic treatment. Critical analysis Freud s theories also have inspired literary critics for more than a century. In the 1940s, Lionel Trilling noted the  poetic quality  of Freud s principles, which, he wrote, descended from  classic tragic realism  a view which does not narrow and simplify the human world for the artist, but, on the contrary, opens and complicates it . Postmodernism, Structuralism and Post-Structuralism   including the work of French theorists Claude Levi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Julia Kristeva   all have roots in Freud s thinking. Susan Sontag argued against Freud and for an  erotics of art  in her 1964 essay Against Interpretation. Harold Bloom applied Freud s Oedipus complex to rivalries among poets and their precursors in his The Anxiety of Influence (1973), an approach given a feminist slant by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in Forward into the Past: The Complex Female Affiliation Complex (1985). Peter Brooks mined Freud s dream-work for ideas of how novels are plotted in Reading for the Plot (1992). Freud s influence continues in the 21st Century. But today he is as likely to turn up as a character as a theoretical catalyst. Recently we ve seen postmodern feminist novels such as the European Union Award-winning Freud s Sister by Goce Smilevski, translated from the Macedonian by Christina E Kramer (2012). This novel fictionalises the melancholy tale of Freud s youngest sister Adolfina, who perished in the Theresienstadt concentration camp (four of Freud s five younger sisters died in the Nazi death camps). Karen Mack and Jennifer Kaufman s historical romance Freud s Mistress (2013) spins a tale out of Freud s alleged affair with Minna, his wife Martha s younger sister. The producers of Downton Abbey have a TV series in the works called Freud: The Secret Casebook, set in fin de si cle Vienna, positing Freud as the first  profiler , and delving into his own  tangled and provocative personal life , Variety reported April 16. Mental detective Freud s case studies, crafted as stories or novellas, have yielded endless bounty for fiction writers. The studies are rich texts to be questioned, critiqued, studied, imitated, modified and fictionalised. One of Freud s best known case studies, described in his 1905 Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria, involves a young woman with limb pains and a hysterical loss of voice, whose symptoms Freud sees as displacements of sexual feelings rooted in childhood memories. Lidia Yuknavitch s edgy 2012 novel Dora: A Headcase, places Dora   whose real name was Ida Bauer   in contemporary Seattle with an analyst she calls Siggy.  I first read Freud s famous case study on hysteria based on his client Ida Bauer when I was in my 20s,  Yuknavitch told The Rumpus.  It pissed me off so badly it haunted me for 25 years. But I had to wait to be a good enough writer to give Ida her voice back.  The Dora case is also the basis of Sheila Kohler s new novel Dreaming for Freud. A beautiful 17-year-old patient is taken to Freud by her father.  He wants her to be more reasonable,  says Kohler.  He wants her to have an affair with his mistress s husband, but not to speak of it. She protests and she says the man has been after her since she was thirteen.  The girl finds Interpretation of Dreams in her father s library and decides to invent dreams to bring to Freud, feeding him fabrications in their sessions that appear in his later case study.  Freud s case studies are all written as mysteries, like Conan Doyle,  says Kohler, who has been teaching a class called Reading Freud's Great Case Histories as Short Stories at Princeton University this spring.  Each case study is a mystery. Each one he solves. Is he right? It doesn t really matter.  This mystery may, in the end, be the point. From his first publications, Freud s ideas were revolutionary and controversial. His followers   Carl Jung, Otto Rank, Alfred Adler, Karen Horney, Anna Freud, Melanie Klein and Erik Erikson among them   diverged from his original blueprint, extending and modifying psychoanalytic thought and practice to this day. Freud the author, awarded the 1930 Goethe prize for literature for his  clear and impeccable style , catalyst for innumerable other writers, may be as important as Freud the scientist. The highest measure of his meaning may derive from the echoes of his voice in artistic work. Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

        "content": "Why is one of Edinburgh's best views still off limits? 1 day ago Share Save Andrew Picken Share Save A look at Edinburgh's Radical Road which has been closed since 2018 It offers one of the iconic views of Edinburgh that has been celebrated in books and paintings for centuries. But access to the city's Radical Road path - set high along cliffs at Arthur's Seat, the extinct volcano that is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks - has been blocked since 2018. This was when 50 tonnes of rock fell from the cliffs, known as the Salisbury Crags, on to the path. The Radical Road was fenced off and years of rancour and indecision about reopening it have followed. Stretching for less than a mile in length, the Radical Road packs a lot in when it comes to rich history and stunning views of Scotland's capital. It overlooks the Scottish Parliament and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where senior royals stay when they visit Edinburgh. The path got its name from the unemployed west of Scotland weavers who were set to work paving a track around Salisbury Crags - a plan suggested by author Sir Walter Scott in the aftermath of the Radical War of 1820. It also contains the location where the founder of modern geology James Hutton arrived at his theory of how and when the world was formed. Why is the Radical Road closed? HES Some of the 50 tonnes of rock which fell from Salisbury Crags in 2018 Rockfalls on a narrow rocky path that clings to the side of a giant slab of dolerite rock are, unsurprisingly, not a new issue. The Radical Road has been regularly temporarily closed after significant volumes of rockfall over the last century, including a 100-tonne fall in 2011. The path was temporarily shut on five occasions in the two years before the 50-tonne fall in late 2018 sparked the current closure. At the time, park operator Historic Environment Scotland (HES) did not have an established policy on categorising what levels of rockfall risk would be considered acceptable. This was produced six years later and shows that three section of the Radical Road - the ones where it is at its narrowest below Salisbury Crags - currently present an unacceptable risk to the public. Why Edinburgh's best view has been hidden for seven years The section with the highest and intolerable risk has an estimated probability of a fatality from a rockfall event of one in 4,886. This compares with one in 95,435 for the section with a tolerable risk, where the rockface is set much further back from the path. Fairhurst, an engineering firm used by HES, also argues that its work elsewhere in the park has led it to conclude the \"number of actual rockfalls is higher than the number that is identified and reported in all areas \". What has been the impact of the closure? HES bills Holyrood Park as the \"most important open public space in the city\" so closing one of its most popular paths has had a big impact. The Radical Road itself has become overgrown without usage for years but HES says the wider path network is now \"highly degraded\" from the pressure of user numbers outweighing the capacity of the paths. Closures due to rockfalls elsewhere in the park, as well as wildfires, have not helped. HES does not have an up-to-date handle on how many people are using the park but an estimate from 2016 suggests more than two million visits a year. The 14 rangers who help manage the park are busier than ever. They dealt with 314 incidents, such as missing persons or fires, in 2023 - up from 162 incidents in 2018. HES Fences and warning signs greet visitors to the start of the Radical Road path At points the overgrowth nearly stretches across the whole path What needs to happen to reopen the Radical Road? Engineering firm Fairhurst first presented HES with options for long-term rockfall mitigation in 2019. It was asked to revise them in February last year to reflect the new rankings of what levels of rockfall risk would be considered acceptable. This report shows that to reopen the Radical Road the majority of the 0.8 miles (1.3km) route will need some form of engineered rockfall fence and netting. This would be similar to the measures in place on the rockface below Edinburgh Castle. Getty Images Steel netting has been in place on the rockface below Edinburgh Castle for years due to the risk of rockfall Other wider sections of the Radical Road would have a sloped earth embankment built to catch any rockfall. Fairhurst suggest this earth bund would need a fence on top to stop people getting in to the rock trap area. The firm's 2024 report estimates all of these remediation measures could cost up to  2.4m. Ranger-led guided walks in some sections of the Radical Road are available but a bigger step in the right direction for campaigners will come next year with a planned partial reopening. The areas marked in red are considered to present an unacceptable risk to the public of a fatality from rockfall Under the plan, the path between an area called The Hawse to the northern end of South Quarry would be open again. This will allow full access to the areas where James Hutton pioneered his theory that the Earth's age could be calculated using observations of volcanic rock. Edinburgh-based geologist Angus Miller, said: \"It's great that we are going to get access to the most geologically important features of the Radical Road but it has taken far too long. \"I don't think there has been an appreciation of what the route means to people and the impact of its closure on the wider park.\" Ramblers Scotland director Brendan Paddy said: \"After years of dithering, delay and broken promises, HES bosses must now stop kicking the can down the road. \"They must publish clear plans showing how they will reopen the 200-year-old Radical Road and boost the wider Holyrood Park path network - then urgently crack on with delivering trails worthy of this world-famous heritage site.\" Getty The dolerite rock of Salisbury Crags was quarried for use as cobble stones until it was outlawed in the 19th Century",

To mark the hundred-year anniversary, a new database containing thousands of personal records and documents from the time has been opened at the University of Oxford - making them fully accessible for the first time. The tomb of the former boy-king was discovered in 1922 by English archaeologist Howard Carter and his patron Lord Carnarvon from Hampshire.

The tale of the pair's incredible archaeological discovery, after years of digging in Luxor with little to show for it, enthralled the world. Getty Images Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter were the two \"unlikely Englishmen\" who discovered the tomb Lord Carnarvon has often been portrayed as merely Carter's patron but \"without him we probably would not have found the tomb of Tutankhamun\", the current Lady Carnarvon explained. She owns and runs the family's ancestral seat at Highclere Castle, in Hampshire, alongside her husband, Lord Carnarvon's great-grandson the eighth Earl of Carnarvon. \"He's often misrepresented today,\" she said of Lord Carnarvon. \"People say he's just a one dimensional financier - far from it.\" \"He was a great traveller, a restless man, and he was always trying to find something else, which I think is innate in all of us,\" she explained. \"He spent the winter months out in Egypt, he became very adept - he wasn't a trained Egyptologist, but nor was Howard Carter.\" \"It was two unlikely Englishmen in some ways, but their resilience, passion, obsession, and obviously his money, led to the discovery of Tutankhamun.\" Getty Images Lady Carnarvon said her great-grandfather-in-law had been \"misunderstood\" Along with photographer Harry Burton, Carter and Lord Carnarvon meticulously documented the tomb's more than 5,000 objects. The collection, which includes thousands of photographs, drawings and notebook pages, was donated to the Griffith Institute, the centre for Egyptology at the University of Oxford, after Carter's death in 1939. \"These records show how the tomb looked like when it was discovered, so this shows you how Howard Carter and his team saw the tomb,\" Daniela Rosenow, manager of the Griffith Institute and Egyptologist, said. Now, for the first time, the records will be available to researchers and the general public on an easy accessible database created by the institute. \"We really hope this will nurture research on the objects, which is desperately needed,\" Ms Rosenow said. \"The tomb of Tutankhamun is still not that well published or studied, because it is not easy to access the actual objects.\" \"My hope is that much more will come out now everyone can search the records and do the research.\" Griffith Institute/Harry Burton It took a committee of experts nine days to unwrap the boy-king's body Lady Carnarvon, who has written a book on the subject, said the documents show the discovery had been the \"result of hard work... and of a really well planned concessions\". \"There was a plan, there was a strategy, but actually in some ways they found it against all the odds.\" And on that November day more than a century ago, Carter, Carnarvon and his daughter, Lady Evelyn, first climbed in to the perfectly intact tomb of the boy-king. Lady Carnarvon said her great-grandfather-in-law had tried to write about first seeing the chamber, but just said it was \"entirely surreal\". \"It was beyond anything they'd ever dreamt of,\" she said. The world's media went into frenzy over the discovery, with Carter and Carnarvon becoming world famous. Griffith Institute/Harry Burton Tutankhamun's burial mask was uncovered after millennia in situ Lady Carnarvon said she believes the interest in Tutankhamun comes from the \"totality of the treasures\". \"It is a window back in time, of a culture which spanned 5,000 years and created works of art and architecture, such as we probably haven't created in our own world after 2,000 years.\" Just months after the discovery, Lord Carnarvon died following a mosquito bite - with some in the media speculating that it was the result of a curse placed on the tomb of Tutankhamun. \"He sacrificed all that we can give,\" Lady Carnarvon said. \"You can read into it what you will.\" \"I think there's a lot we don't understand in this world and the next, however you choose to interpret our imagination and our consciousness,\" she added. Griffith Institute/Howard Carter Ms Rosenow said autopsy drawings done by Carter during the unwrapping were among her \"favourite archaeological records ever\" A beta version of the Oxford database launches on Tuesday, exactly a hundred years on from the unwrapping of Tutankhamun's mummy, and will showcase Carter's material from the de-mummifying process. \"We do have other royal mummies, but none before were found in their context, their tombs had all already been plundered in antiquity - this is the first and only time that a royal mummy had been discovered in situ,\" Ms Rosenow explained of the event's significance. \"This was all planned in a very scientific way, a committee of experts was gathered and it took them nine days to unwrap the body.\" She added: \"During these nine days, some of the most stunning archaeological records ever were produced.\" Getty Images The new Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo houses treasures from the tomb, including Tutankhamun's golden coffin The databases launch comes just weeks after the Grand Egyptian Museum fully opened in the shadow of the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza. Described as the world's largest archaeological museum, it is packed with some 100,000 artefacts - including the entire contents of Tutankhamun's tomb. \"You can now see all these objects carefully curated as individual masterpieces,\" Ms Rosenow said. \"But not everyone can travel to Egypt, and our database will give everyone around the world the sense of how the tomb originally looked.\" Once the database is completed, and the 5000 or so objects are inputted, Ms Rosenow said the next step was to create an interactive 3D digital model of the tomb as it was found. Tutankhamun Exhibition The Tutankhamun Exhibition in Dorchester gives visitors the chance to experience an exact replica of the tomb But in Dorchester, that is already a reality. The Tutankhamun Exhibition in the town gives visitors the chance to experience an exact replica of the tomb. Michael Ridley, the exhibition's director, said the showcase's journey from its original home at the British Museum had been an \"accident of history\". Struggles to find a suitable permanent home for the display eventually ended with the choice of a redundant church in Dorset's county town. It has remained there ever since, with more than two million people having visited it in that time. Mr Ridley said visitors came through the doors because Tutankhamun's story was \"in fact many stories\". \"It is about the discovery of treasure, it's because of the wonderful gold mask that covered the head of Tut's mummy, and because of the mystery of why and how this pharaoh died at the young age of 19,\" he said. Of the new database, Mr Ridley said its appeal was that \"documents are the raw material of history\". \"They combine with the evidence unearthed by archaeology to make sense of the past.\" Griffith Institute/Harry Burton Photographer Harry Burton meticulously photographed the de-mummifying process More than a century on from the discovery, the story of Tutankhamun and his uncovering after millennia still captivates and intrigues the world. \"I think it's like all the appeal of Rider Haggard, Indiana Jones and the missions that we set ourselves in life,\" Lady Carnarvon suggested on why interest remains. \"All of us are the same, and I think the ultimate desire we all have, a quest we all have, is for knowledge, or for treasure - and maybe knowledge is treasure.\" But Ms Rosenow suggested a different answer for the persisting interest. \"There's this mystery about this young man who died very unexpectedly, but also it's the amazing and beautiful objects,\" she said. \"They are visually striking and you learn so much about ancient Egypt, but also about this young person, Tutankhamun.\" \"Hopefully, a 100 years on, you can actually move away from the gold and the curse and look at the young man.\"",

It is called \"Alt for Norge\" - which translates as \"All for Norway\" - a saying which dates back to World War II, when Dumfries became known as the \"unofficial Norwegian capital\". Over recent years, the balcony of Dumfries Museum has been completely revamped with a focus on military history. People with links to both countries attended the recent launch of the new archive material on display celebrating the Scandinavian connection. A telegram thanking the people of Dumfries is part of the exhibition In 1940 Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany, which meant many people fled and ended up in Dumfries. Many were based in Troqueer and Rosefield Mills, where they built a thriving community. This included setting up a Norwegian Society, where they hosted events from Burns suppers, to language classes. There were also 200 weddings between Norwegians and people from Dumfries, which is why some tourists from Norway continue to travel to Dumfries, so they can see where their parents got married. A launch of the exhibition celebrating the Norwegian links was held at Dumfries Museum Judith Hewitt, curator of the exhibition, said one special item in the exhibition was a telegram sent from Buckingham Palace in 1945. \"It's from the King of Norway, King Haakon VII, and it's to the provost of Dumfries on the liberation of Norway,\" she explained. \"It's giving thanks to the people of Dumfries for all they did to liberate his country. \"For a time in World War II, Dumfries was known as the capital city of Norway because so many Norwegians were here - 3,000 of them.\" Judith said the skis were her favourite part of the exhibition She said another special item was also worth highlighting. \"There's a famous campaign that the Norwegian army were involved in during World War II and it was to stop the Nazis getting the atom bomb,\" she said. \"I was told a long time ago that we had a set of skis in the museum collection that was used in the campaign to blow up the heavy water plant (a place where atom bombs could be manufactured) before the Nazis reached it.\" Judith said that the skis used came from Dumfries, which meant that the Norwegian army was carrying this small link to the town through their mode of transport. The display includes two uniforms worn by Norwegian soldiers \"They're with a big display about The Heroes of Telemark film, which is based on the book Skis Against the Atom, and it's quite probable that these skis saved the world,\" she said. Other items included are two uniforms of Norwegian soldiers with the photos and diplomas of the men who wore them along with an explanation of their Dumfries connection. The exhibition will run until 1 February next year.",

The 3,000-year-old artefact currently resides in the Great Hall at Chiddingstone Castle in Edenbridge, and the plan is to move it down several flights of stairs in order to be with similar relics in another part of the building. There it will be placed into a bespoke, museum-grade display case to make it more accessible to visitors. Curator Naomi Collick said its new home would also \"help preserve it for decades to come\". The operation to move the coffin lid will take place on 27 November, in plenty of time for when the castle, now closed for winter, reopens to the public in March. Studies of the coffin lid in 2017 revealed its origins, with analysis of its badly faded hieroglyphs identifying the name of the person for whom it was made. The middle of a set of three nested wooden coffins, it belonged to a man called Irethoreru, who lived during Egypt's 25th dynasty (circa 760   656BC). It will now be placed in the castle's designated Egyptian Room to sit alongside the rest of the historic collection from that period.

Garfield, meanwhile, embarked on an ambitious agenda for his presidency, including upgrading the US Navy, aiming to expand trade with Latin America, and advocating for civil rights. He appointed the once-enslaved social reformer Frederick Douglass as recorder of deeds for the District of Columbia, the first African American to hold a prominent federal office.

Those who climbed up the mountain trails to see it would encounter an icy, barren expanse of white, dark blue and aquamarine. Visitors described a scene akin to a torrent of waves and whirlpools frozen in time; an unrelenting frost extending boundlessly into the mountains. Many artists at the time painted this icy sea, but one of the most striking images is an early photograph: a gloomy daguerreotype taken by an assistant of the writer John Ruskin in the 1850s (above). This was the \"Mer de Glace\" glacier   a mass of compacted snowfall, creeping down from the Mont Blanc massif. For centuries, it has remained the largest glacier in France, and was one of the first to be studied scientifically. Sadly, it has shrunk profoundly since then   more than 2.5km (1.6 miles) since the mid-1800s   and as I discovered following a recent visit, it is barely visible from the same point that the Ruskin photo was taken.

Mandela spent short stints here in 1956 and 1962 while awaiting trial, and although the cells he occupied have since been demolished, a recreated one contains a permanent exhibition documenting his stay both here and on Cape Town s Robben Island, largely through correspondence written during his incarceration. The one-time prison also offers a chilling look at the apartheid regime, where deep racial inequalities permeated even the penal system. The sightseeing bus then takes you on an equally emotional ride to the excellent Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg South, where the exhibition is as superbly moving as it is distressing. Understanding the political system that ruled South Africa from 1948 to 1994 is essential to understanding Mandela himself, and a couple of hours spent walking through recent history will help untangle the extent of the complex web of laws that segregated every aspect of South African society. Throughout the 1950s and  60s, Mandela s home was a simple dwelling on Vilakazi Street in Soweto, a thriving suburb 30km southwest of Johannesburg   though his underground political activities meant that he spent little time here with wife Winnie and their two daughters. Today, the house is preserved as a museum, and while the information panels go a long way to explaining this era in Mandela s life, it is the impassioned guided tours that make this a must-see stop. In those final years before his lengthy incarceration (1962 to 1990), Mandela also spent time in a farmhouse 28km to the north of the city. In the 1960s, Liliesleaf Farm was the headquarters of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the then-banned ANC. Today it has been transformed into a magnificent museum, where interactive exhibits draw visitors into a fascinating chapter in South African history. Information is abundant, so be sure to set aside half a day to fully appreciate the role that Liliesleaf played in the resistance movement. Cape Town and around: Imprisonment and freedom (1964 to 1990) After the Rivonia Trial, which began with the Liliesleaf raid in 1963 and wrapped up in 1964, in which 10 leaders of the ANC were tried for acts of sabotage designed to overthrow the apartheid system, Mandela was moved to Robben Island, South Africa s answer to Alcatraz. Lying 7km off Cape Town s coast, the island served as a jail, a leper colony and a World War II fortification before returning to its roots in 1961 as a maximum security prison with virtually no chance of escape. Today the building is a museum, and it s is one of the main attractions in a city awash with activities and sights. Board a ferry at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront for the half day trip that takes in the choppy seas, tours the island and makes an all-important stop at the cell that held prisoner 46664 for much of his 27 years behind bars. Towards the end of his incarceration, Mandela was moved between prisons in the Cape. Both Pollsmoor Prison and Drakenstein Correctional Centre (formerly Victor Verster Prison) remain in use, and the latter, 70km east of Cape Town in the Winelands, is worth a visit. It is here that Mandela spent his final days of imprisonment and where the memorable scenes of him walking free for the first time in almost three decades were shot. A bronze statue of the great man, hand raised in triumph, commemorates the moment. If you re lucky, you might find a warden to take you on a quick unofficial tour of the cottage where he spent his final years of captivity. Back in Cape Town, there is one more sight to see: the Edwardian City Hall facade overlooking Grand Parade. This large square is home to a daily bustling market, but on 11 February 1990, thousands gathered in this spot to hear Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela speak from the balcony as a free man for the first time in more than 27 years. Visit on a Sunday when the square is quieter and ponder the life of a man who epitomised forgiveness and reconciliation, and inspired not only a nation, but the rest of the world as well.",

He swaggered about with a sword at his side and once flung a plate of scalding artichokes in the face of a waiter, supposedly because some of them were cooked in butter rather than oil. Yet even by his own combustible standards two years earlier he had crossed a line, when he killed a man in a quarrel over a gambling debt at a tennis match. Before he could be charged with murder, he fled Rome and spent the rest of his short life as a fugitive from justice. That autumn in 1608, following spells in Naples and Malta, he arrived in Sicily.

        "content": "Another issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive. The answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.'

This elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A 12.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\" The project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"",

The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993. It sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993. But the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell. WATCH: 'On a clear night, it could illuminate an area the size of a football stadium'. Even today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one. Back in 1923, German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth had proposed it in The Rocket into Planetary Space. His self-published book   based on a PhD thesis which Heidelberg University had rejected for seeming too implausible   demonstrated mathematically how a rocket could leave the Earth's orbit. Among the other ideas covered in the publication were the potential effects on the human body of space travel, how satellites could be launched into orbit, and, crucially, the concept of creating a grid of colossal adjustable concave mirrors that could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the Earth. Oberth reasoned that this illumination could help avert disasters   like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912   or assist with the rescue of their survivors. Oberth also speculated that space mirrors could be used to clear shipping lanes by melting icebergs or even to manipulate the Earth's weather patterns.",

In the early 1940s, he had promised his daughters, who were fans of the first book, that he would adapt it into a movie. But he had not counted upon its notoriously prickly author, Travers. He spent the next 20 years repeatedly trying to persuade her to sell him the screen rights. By the 1960s, despite Travers' serious misgivings about Disney's much more jolly, whimsical take on the darker elements of Mary Poppins, the author s increasingly dire financial situation forced her to relent. Despite author PL Travers describing Mary Poppins in the books as being very plain, Disney had a clear idea he wanted Andrews for the 'practically perfect in every way' nanny In 2013, Disney would depict their founder's fractious relationship with the intransigent Travers, and his efforts to bring the book to the screen, in the film Saving Mr Banks. In keeping with the author's fears about the adaptation of her own book, some critics claimed that the film portrayed a highly sanitised version of their antagonistic relationship, and the two complicated people involved.

A fast-rising talent By this time, Andrews had already established a successful stage career on both sides of the Atlantic. Born in 1935, in Surrey, in the UK, Andrews' mother and stepfather, on discovering their daughter's exceptional singing ability and four-octave vocal range, propelled her towards a career on stage. By the age of 12, she was astonishing West End audiences in London with her clear, melodic soprano voice. In 1954, she made her US debut on Broadway in the immensely popular The Boy Friend, but it was her role as Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in the 1956 musical My Fair Lady that really brought her to people's attention.

Described by experts as the county's \"ancient sacred heart\", Castilly Henge is believed to have been built during the late Neolithic period - about 3,000 to 2,500 BCE (Before Common Era). More than  40,000 of National Lottery funding was awarded to Cornwall Heritage Trust (CHT) to excavate a hidden stone circle at its centre earlier this year. Carolyn Kennett, CHT's site project manager, said: \"Neolithic henges are incredibly rare, so this is a really exciting moment.\" Is there a Bronze Age stone circle in Bodmin? Located just off the A30 near Bodmin, the substantial oval embankment that makes up Castilly Henge is believed to have been once used as an amphitheatre-like setting for gatherings and ritual activities. Its significance continued into the Early Bronze Age (circa 2,400 to 1,500 BCE) when several high-status burial mounds or barrows were built close by. Previous researchers also suggested that the site might have been used as a medieval open-air theatre known as a plen-an-gwari, as well as fortified housing for cannons during the English Civil War. The four-week archaeological excavation, which is a collaboration between the CHT, Cornwall Archaeological Society and Historic England, aimed to delve deeper into the monument's backstory, project leaders said.

Ms Kennett said she hoped that the henge - which is at risk from invasive vegetation and nearby road infrastructure - could be saved for future generations. \"Our goal is to fundraise to purchase this site and to open it up to public,\" she said, adding that more than  10,000 of an overall  50,000 target had already been raised. Dr Olaf Bayer, senior archaeological investigator for Historic England, described the henge as offering a \"direct visceral connection\" to our ancestors. \"To discover and hold in your own hands the very tools people of the past had used - it's the kind of stuff that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck,\" he said.",

On 23 September, 1779, beneath Bempton Cliffs, a French and American fleet of four ships swooped in and attacked two British Royal Navy vessels that were escorting a convoy. The USS Bonhomme Richard, under the command of Scottish-born naval captain John Paul Jones, managed to capture the frigate HMS Serapis. The Battle of Flamborough Head, during the American War of Independence, is now one of the most celebrated naval actions in US history. To mark the 246th anniversary, a refurbished monument, known as a toposcope, will be unveiled on the cliff tops with markings pointing to the site of the battle. One of the organisers, Kim Hodgson, secretary of Yorkshire Coast 1779, said Jones is seen as \"the father of the US Navy\". \"They actually still teach the Battle of Flamborough Head to every midshipman that goes through their officer training,\" she said. \"They see him as a hero and so it is a very important battle for the Americans. \"It gave the Americans a boost that they could just about win the war because at the time America was not doing very well, they were suffering quite a few defeats over in the colonies, so this really gave them a boost of confidence. \"The Royal Navy was outnumbered two to one but they managed to protect the convoy, it was saved, but they did lose both their ships.\" Getty Images Scottish-born naval captain John Paul Jones is seen as the father figure of the US Navy According to the research group, more than 400 men and boys were killed and injured when Captain Jones captured the Serapis, with his own Bonhomme Richard later sinking. Ms Hodgson added: \"The Americans treat it as a battle that they won. They may have captured two ships but they didn't achieve their objective, which was to capture some of those supply ships. \"They got off with the two Royal Navy ships but they didn't achieve their objective, but the Royal Navy did. That's why we want to raise this significant event.\" Legend has it that when the two ships were side by side firing broadsides into each other the captain of HMS Serapis asked Jones if he was prepared to surrender, to which he reportedly replied \"I have not yet begun to fight\". The refurbished toposcope was first installed on Bempton Cliffs in 1959 The toposcope will be unveiled in the presence of the Lord Lieutenant of East Yorkshire, Jim Dick OBE, Michael Rice, High Sheriff of East Yorkshire, Charlie Dewhirst MP for Bridlington and the Wolds and Liam Dealtry, chairman of East Riding of Yorkshire Council. It was originally built in 1959 and has been refurbished and made more accessible. As well as arrows pointing to the site of the battle, panels will be installed giving more information about the skirmish, allowing visitors to \"look out to sea and reimagine this ferocious battle and what it must have been like for the terrified locals watching this\". Ms Hodgson said the monument was a \"really nice opportunity to remember our history and the significance of what the Yorkshire Coast played in that little bit of a historic timeline in 1779\".

The piece of gilded silver jewellery was discovered by a metal detectorist at Carleton Rode, near Attleborough, Norfolk, earlier this year. Dr Natasha Harlow, an expert in portable Iceni objects, said it was quite a rare piece and was probably made in East Anglia. The brooch is going through the treasure process and Norwich Castle Museum is hoping to acquire it. \"It would have been very eye-catching, as it was made from silver and it was partly gilded, so it had these flashes of gold and silver,\" said Dr Harlow, who is an honorary research fellow at the University of Nottingham. \"[The Iron Age] would have been a very bright and colourful world to live in, which is not necessarily what we think of when we think of British pre-Roman history.\" Andrew Williams/Norfolk County Council Only 17 similar brooches have been found in Norfolk making then quite rare, said Natasha Harlow The find has been dated to between 30BC and AD60 and is reminiscent of other late Iron Age finds from Norfolk, she said. In particular, she pointed to three little pellet shapes at its base, which are seen in Iceni coins and horse metal work. The Iceni were a tribe occupying present-day Norfolk and Suffolk and are most famous for queen Boudicca, who led a revolt against the Romans. Dr Harlow said: \"In northern East Anglia, there is a regional distinctiveness to the settlements and we tend to see people showing their wealth and status through the small items they wore - it shows something about the wearer's importance and access to resources.\" This style of brooch is known as the Birdlip type, because the first one of its kind was found at Birdlip, near Gloucester. In a time before buttons and zips, brooches were also believed to have had a practical purpose, acting as safety pins to hold clothes together, Dr Harlow added.

The Great Fire of Northampton destroyed 700 out of 850 buildings and claimed 11 lives within hours of starting on 20 September 1675. The anniversary has been commemorated with a series of events in the town over six months. But, what caused the devastating blaze and how did Charles II help with its rebuild? The BBC has been finding out. 'Densely packed and filthy' Joseph Ashmenall/BBC One of the few houses to survive the conflagration was Hazelrigg House, part of which did need rebuilding Northampton in 1675 was still essentially a medieval town, densely packed with lots of alleyways, having evolved in a random way over centuries, according to Alan Clark, an expert on the town's history. \"At the same time there was a population increase in what was a golden era of English market towns in terms of commercial activity, which meant the population density was such that properties were simply ramshackle, insalubrious and often filthy,\" he added. The vast majority of the buildings were thatched and built from timber frames with plaster walls imbedded with straw and horse hair - all highly flammable. Dr Clark said the local authorities were well aware of this, repeatedly urging people to maintain what fire precautions were in place. Meanwhile, conditions across the country were tinder-dry. \"[The year] 1675 is known for a terrible drought, which began in January and continued throughout the year,\" he said. \"So along with supplies like hay for horses and barrels of alcohol, it was a recipe for disaster,\" he added. 'Going up in a whoosh' Nick Moses/BBC James Miller (left) and Earl Spencer (right) have been researching the Great Fire of Northampton The fire is believed to have started accidentally on St Mary's Street, now Chalk Lane. Dr Clark said: \"It's reported that late in the morning of 20 September, a woman put a kettle on an open fire and left it unattended, so this is just a simple human occurrence - except that on this day a very stiff wind, blowing directly from the west, had been suddenly picking up in speed and strength. \"It may have contributed to the ignition of the fire at that lady's property and fanned those flames into and affecting other properties.\" An eyewitness riding past the town and bound for London would later describe the astonishing speed of the blaze that ripped through the town. Earl Spencer, who has has written several historical books and co-hosts a history podcast, said: \"I've read contemporary accounts that say the Great Fire of Northampton was more devastating than the Great Fire of London (1666) for its scale. \"You think of these quite compressed, highly combustible buildings going up in a whoosh.\" Trapped in the market square Joseph Ashmenall/BBC Many of the townsfolk fled to the safety of the market square - reportedly the largest in the Midlands - only to seek escape through the Welsh House (above) As the blaze began at about midday, people could grab some of their possessions and flee, said art historian James Miller, who worked on the town's anniversary events. \"They weren't in their beds, they knew it was coming and they all rushed to the large Market Square because they thought that would be quite safe,\" he said. But the square was packed with more combustible material, which also caught fire and \"whoosh off it went\" trapping them, he said. Just as they feared the worst, the terrified people discovered an opening at The Welsh House, in the square's north-eastern corner, enabling them to cross its grounds by the side of the property to make their escape. Meanwhile, the fire reached All Hallows Church, south of the Market Square, which supercharged the blaze. Dr Clark said: \"Its central crossing tower becomes a chimney and magnifies, radiates and increases the intensity of the heat and so the fire reignites and this then allows it to leap spaces and to spread and continue eastward to St Giles' Church.\" Then the weather that had helped whip up the conflagration, suddenly came to the town's aid. Mr Miller said: \"The next morning, a gale took place and it drenched the town - it had burnt down but within 36 hours, it was sodden and the fire was out.\" 'You should have seen the looting' Joseph Ashmenall/BBC All Saints' Church stands on the site of the burned-out All Hallows' Church and was built within five years of the devastating blaze Thousands of people were now without their homes - more than 80% of the town's properties were uninhabitable. They were about to benefit from a rapid rebuild thanks to lessons learned from the Great Fire of London - and royal support. Dr Clark said it had taken five months to pass an Act of Parliament for London's rebuild and this set the foundations for helping destroyed towns and cities going forward. \"One of the first buildings to be constructed was the Sessions House in 1678, because it is regulating the economy, levying taxes and fines and reconstitution of law and order,\" he said. \"This mattered, because an anecdote from the time was, 'If you thought the fire was bad, you should have seen the looting'.\" Next to be rebuilt was All Saints' Church, constructed on the foundations of All Hallows and funded by the ecclesiastical authorities. Dr Clark said, for many people, the immediate impact of the blaze was devastating - \"exceptional poverty becomes rampant, people starve and are left impoverished\". 'An act of reconciliation' Getty Images Charles II (1660 to 1685) became one of the chief benefactors of the construction effort Leading local figures stepped in with offers of help. The Reverend Oliver Cross, the rector of All Saints' Church, said: \"The Earl of Northampton turned up the day after the fire and donated  150 for the immediate aid effort.\" Others who helped the rebuild efforts were chief justice Sir Richard Rainsford, who had experience working on the aftermath of the Great Fire of London, and Sir Roger Norwich. Prior to the fire, Charles II had pulled down Northampton's town walls to punish its people for Parliamentarian supporters during the English Civil Wars of the 1640s and 1650s.

One pilot tells BBC Future what it feels like to fly them. They are two of the most celebrated aircraft still flying today. The two Boeing B-29s flown by the Commemorative Air Force (CAF) in the US are the last airworthy examples of nearly 4,000 built in the mid-1940s, the largest bomber in the world at that time and a design which pushed aviation technology to the limit. The aircraft, nicked \"Fifi\" and \"Doc\" by the CAF, take part in airshows across the US during the summer, where aviation fans can pay to ride along in 30-minute-long demonstration flights. The Boeing B-29 was the most advanced bomber in the world when it entered service in 1945: it was the first mass-produced aircraft to have pressurised compartments for the crew, and it could fly higher and further than any other aircraft thanks to its four enormous engines. These engines also helped it fly almost as fast as the fighter planes of the time. Designing and building it cost more than the atomic bombs that B-29s would eventually drop on Japan to end World War Two. Bringing the B-29 into service was a colossal industrial project that at times overwhelmed Boeing. Its engines were powerful but temperamental, and keeping them in line required the full-time attention of a dedicated flight engineer, who kept a beady eye on engine temperatures to avoid the engines catching fire from overheating. Even getting a B-29 airborne for its mission over Japan required great effort in the humid air of tropical airfields. So, 80 years after the B-29 helped bring the world's most costly conflict to a close, what is it like to fly one now?",

The manuscript details plans for his journey across what would become New Spain. The page - which describes payments made for supplies for expeditions - was discovered in the US and repatriated on Wednesday. The manuscript page was penned in 1527 and is one of 15 pages thought to have been swiped from Mexico's national archives between 1985 and 1993, the US investigatory agency said. The FBI has returned a 500-year-old stolen document signed by Spanish conquistador Hern n Cort s to Mexico. At its height, the colony stretched across much of western and central North America, and into Latin America. The previously missing document was written after Cort s had been made the governor of New Spain by the Spanish crown. Mexico's national archives had counted the document among a collection of papers signed by Cort s - but found 15 pages were missing when it was put on microfilm in 1993. The recovered page bore a number written in wax that archivists had applied in 1985-1986, suggesting it had been stolen between the two cataloguing periods. The Mexican government requested the assistance of the FBI's art crime team in finding the missing documents in 2024, providing notes on which pages had been taken and how certain pages had been torn. The FBI said open-source research revealed the document was located in the US. The agency did not reveal exactly where the manuscript page was found or who had owned it when it was seized. No one will face prosecution over the theft as the page had \"changed hands several times\" since it was stolen, according to Special Agent Jessica Dittmer of the FBI's art crime team. The document \"really gives a lot of flavour as to the planning and preparation for uncharted territory back then\", she said, outlining \"the payment of pesos of common gold for expenses in preparation for discovery of the spice lands\". The so-called \"spice lands\" were areas of eastern and southern Asia. Europeans sought to find a quicker trade route with these areas by sailing west, but in doing so landed on the Americas instead. Cort s would go on to explore north-western Mexico and the Baja California peninsula. The document's repatriation comes at a time of political tension between Mexico and the US over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and illegal migration across the US-Mexico border. But the FBI says that, as one of the largest consumers of antiquities, the US had a responsibility to counter the trafficking of artefacts. Ms Dittmer said: \"Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico's history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their archives for the purpose of understanding history better.\" The FBI said it was determined to locate and repatriate the other pages still missing from the collection. Another document signed by Cort s was returned to Mexico by the FBI in 2023.",

The team from the University of Southampton said it was the first time one from this period had been totally uncovered in the UK. Buckler's Hard, the small hamlet in the New Forest where the slipway is located, was once home to one of the busiest private shipyards of the 1700s. The researchers said they hoped the findings would help improve their understanding of shipbuilding techniques and infrastructure during the period. The slipway is the first of its era to be fully revealed in the UK The dig was supported by the newly formed Buckler's Hard Shipyard Trust, a conservation charity. A total of 55 wooden warships were built at Buckler's Hard for the Royal Navy in the 1700s, some of which were comparable in size to HMS Victory. \"No other private yard built as many ships for the navy during this period,\" said Prof Jon Adams, director of the university's Centre for Maritime Archaeology.

The 41 slabs cross the Ewenny River in the Vale of Glamorgan and are adjacent to the 12th Century Ogmore Castle. They are listed as being \"of national importance\". In recent days, the names Patrick, Lily and Liana have appeared cut deeply into three stones. South Wales Police is investigating the damage as a heritage crime, with support from Cadw, the body which preserves and protects Welsh heritage. Cadw said criminal damage to listed buildings was on the increase, adding this year could see the highest ever number of reported crimes of damage and vandalism at some of Wales' ancient sites. The body said heritage crime was widely under-reported but rising, and encouraged anyone who witnesses suspicious behaviour at heritage sites to report it. It is a criminal offence to damage or destroy a scheduled monument or use metal detectors on protected sites without consent. Erica Staple, from nearby Merthyr Mawr, said it was \"mindless and unacceptable\". Ms Staple likened the damage to the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland. \"This is an absolutely beautiful place,\" she said. \"The whole village is upset by it. They've been there for hundreds of years and they've been defaced. \"To think anyone could do that. It's just awful.\" She added her daughter asked if it could be put right, and she told her \"there's nothing we can really do\". Marc Hollyman South Wales Police is investigating the damage as a heritage crime Ms Staple said she was concerned the three names could inspire copycats and there could be further vandalism. \"We've got to treasure what we've got,\" she said.

The Buckinghamshire Council site in High Wycombe has four separate buildings, including a neo-Georgian structure built in 1932. A Conservative councillor said she was \"exceptionally disappointed that this wonderful building is being sold\". The council said the site was \"currently underused\" and offered a \"prime location\". The 1932 building in Queen Victoria Road was designed by Richard Greaves Brocklehurst and Charles Cowles-Voysey in the neo-Georgian style. The Royal Institute of British Architects awarded a bronze medal for the design. On Tuesday, the Conservative-controlled council's cabinet will decide whether the sale of the site should go ahead with the most likely outcome being a residential development. A drawing of a possible design for the land shows about 180 flats across three buildings of up to seven storeys. The listed front facade of the 1932 building would be retained and converted but the rest of the site would be cleared. Councillor Lesley Clarke said the sale plan was \"disappointing in the extreme\" Lesley Clarke OBE, a conservative councillor, said: \"I am exceptionally disappointed that this wonderful building is being sold and that the Council Offices are moving. \"It is a beautiful building and has a lot of history . disappointing in the extreme.\" Independent councillor Trevor Snaith called for an immediate halt to the sale process and a full and open public consultation. He said the council was being \"arrogant, short-sighted and undemocratic\" as there had been \"no transparent discussion about the future of the historic frontage or its role in mayoralty, civic occasions, and local democracy\".

The spokesperson added the site was currently underused and offered a prime location and \"huge opportunity\" to attract further investment.

        "content": "Volunteers reclaiming much loved historic railway 5 September 2025 Share Save Bea Swallow, BBC News, West of England and Luke Knight, BBC Radio Somerset Share Save The historic line ran between Bath in Somerset and Bournemouth in Dorset For more than a century the Somerset and Dorset Railway (S&D) served as a lifeline for rural communities - transporting coal, commuters and holidaymakers alike. The historic line ran between Bath in Somerset and Bournemouth in Dorset, serving towns and villages such as Highbridge, Glastonbury, Wells, and Wincanton. This week is the 60th anniversary since the 105-mile (168km) route was given a public notice it had to close all its station due to the Beeching cuts - a sweeping reduction of the UK rail network that severed thousands of miles of track. But now volunteers, historians and local residents are reclaiming sections of the abandoned route, determined to preserve the once rich history of the railway line. Julian Peters The historic line ran between Bath in Somerset and Bournemouth in Dorset In the 1960s, the British railway system was considered financially unsustainable, with underused lines, high maintenance costs, and slow passenger services. Dr Richard Beeching, former chair of the British Railways Board, aimed to modernise the railways by eliminating unprofitable routes and stations to create a more efficient, financially sound network. A total of 2,363 train stations were axed across Britain. As a child, Colin Price and his family referred to the S&D railway as the \"holiday line\", transporting them from Wells to Bournemouth for a seaside getaway. \"I was keen on railways anyway, so obviously I spent all my time with my head out the window, as you could in those days,\" he laughed. Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust On 5 March 1966 a coffin with the words \"S&D died today\" was loaded on to the very last train in a mock funeral to mark the service's demise Mr Price said the day the stone station was built, local residents \"thought it would be there forever, but it wasn't\". \"It was a very sad day,\" he recalled, as he watched the wooden sleepers being ripped from the ground. \"There was a lot of feeling around that it was the end of an era. \"The closest station would have been the main line at Castle Cary. It was getting further and further from anybody here, cutting us all off.\" John Strickland When the stone station closed, residents said they felt cut off from the world Elsewhere in Midford, tears welled in Peter Davis' eyes as he watched workmen tear down a legacy. \"My grandparents used to live just up the road, so I can remember it as a child,\" he said, conjuring a faint memory of roaring black locomotives. \"They took a couple of years to take the track up and I remember seeing them do it. It had a big effect on me. I cried at the time, I thought I'd lost something.\" Peter Davis said watching the train station fall into disrepair felt like a personal loss Eight years ago, Mr Davis began volunteering at the former station, cutting back overgrown vegetation and reinstalling old signs to \"see more clearly what it used to be like\". \"We lost a lot in the Beeching cuts, a lot of good railway lines,\" he said. \"But this is one I thought I could focus in on. It needed something doing with it.\" The site is now part of a popular walking and cycling path called the Two Tunnels Greenway, featuring the Devonshire Tunnel and the Combe Down Tunnel. Frank Tompson said life without the Two Tunnels network would be \"unimaginable\" Frank Tompson, chair of the Two Tunnels group, says the line was transformed into an active travel path in 2013, almost 50 years after the last trains rumbled through the stone arches. \"It was a case of uncovering both of the tunnels, keeping our fingers crossed they were in good condition, which luckily they were,\" he said. \"When you've got something like this on your doorstep, it's just a case of recycling what's already there. Bath now without the Two Tunnels would be unimaginable.\" In Shepton Mallet, the disused Windsor Hill tunnels are finding their purpose again as part of a 76-mile (122km) traffic-free circuit known as the Somerset Circle. When the passenger services stopped, the demolition trains arrived - destroying the Windsor Hill Tunnels so they could never be used again Gavin Mayall leads the Friends of Windsor Hill Tunnels group, a team of volunteers who \"dared to dream\" of reopening the route to the public. \"Probably about four years ago, the tunnel was inaccessible,\" he said. \"It was gated and there was scrap, fridges, tyres and all sorts just dumped here. \"A group of volunteers decided it was about time this amazing resource that had been lost for so many years was reopened to the public. \"The usage now is nothing short of remarkable. You build the paths and the people will come.\" However, the second tunnel still remains closed due to a rare bat colony nesting in its arches. The signal box, painted in the S&D colours, overlooks the former track at Masbury A disused signal box, originally built in 1874, was previously left to rot beside the former Masbury station before Joe Bourne snapped it up. He was in the process of putting his house on the market when he spotted the unique gem for sale. \"Most signal boxes were destroyed when they closed the line, or were vandalised or destroyed. I thought it had to be done,\" he said. \"It was a pile of rubble when I first moved here. I've never had a grand plan. I just saw the opportunity to buy it and I thought 'what a cool place, what a project'.\" Mr Bourne sensitively restored the building back to its former glory, painting it in the original S&D colours as a tribute to the lost relic. Rosie Craddock, lives in S&D railway viaduct with her family Rosie Craddock, lives in S&D railway viaduct with her family in Shoscombe. Her grandparents bought the land in the 80s following a long battle for planning permission. \"He [granddad] had the vision originally to make the arches into a house. \"Unfortunately he got too old to finish it, and my husband and I saw an opportunity. \"It's only when you get visitors like 'wow' you think, 'oh yeah actually, it is quite special',\" she added. Roger Burfitt described the S&D railway as a \"part of [the] community\" Roger Burfitt is acting chair of trustees at the S&D Railway Heritage Trust, who run public day trips along a mile-long (1.6 km) restored section of the railway in Midsomer Norton. The group of enthusiasts got together when the station was just days away from being demolished. \"They managed to save the day at literally the last minute,\" he explained. \"We are extremely fortunate because most of the other stations on the railway have either been demolished or become private residences.\" The station's signal box has been completely rebuilt to the original design, using components that have been rescued from other derelict signal boxes. \"It wasn't just an old railway, it served a purpose, it was part of a community. It fulfils a different role now,\" Mr Burfitt added fondly.",

Cadw said this year could see the highest ever number of reported crimes of damage and vandalism at some of Wales' ancient sites. It is a criminal offence to damage or destroy a scheduled monument or use metal detectors on protected sites without consent. Cadw said heritage crime was widely under-reported but rising, and has encouraged anyone who witnesses suspicious behaviour at heritage sites to report it. Criminal damage to listed buildings is on the increase, Cadw has said Neath Abbey has seen a spate of incidents this year, including new signage damaged, grass torn up and used as a bike track, windows to the under croft smashed, and a Tudor exhibition vandalised. Jon Berry from Cadw said there were \"40 to 50 incidents a year\" of heritage crime at their sites and \"in the low hundreds\" across historical environments in Wales. \"There's a cost to the public purse,\" said Mr Berry. \"At Neath Abbey it was mostly modern infrastructure that was damaged and the wonderful thing about these sites is they are authentic fragments we've inherited from the past, and once it's damaged or destroyed we've lost that so the community and all of our visitors lose out as that archaeological source is eroded.\" Since the beginning of the year, there have been police reports of criminal damage at several Cadw sites. In some cases, it has resulted in sites being partially closed to the public and planned conservation work being postponed to prioritise repairs. Anti-social behaviour at Caerleon's Amphitheatre and Barracks has seen graffiti, the heat from barbecues damaging Roman brickwork and even a burnt-out motorbike left at the site. Blaenavon Ironworks' Cast House was recently closed to the public after a visual display was vandalised and bricks thrown from the top of a tower. \"There are incidents of theft too at Blaenavon iron works,\" said Mr Berry. \"Lead from the roof was stolen, we replaced it, and it was stolen again. \"So, we now use a product which looks like lead but isn't and thankfully that has stayed on the roof.\" Windows to the under croft of Neath Abbey were smashed, and a Tudor exhibition vandalised Wales has one of the highest proportions of historic buildings in Europe - 30,100 buildings are listed. There are more than 4,000 scheduled monuments which include archaeological sites of national importance including Roman remains, burial mounds, castles, and bridges, with 400 registered historic parks and four world heritage sites. The consequences for deliberate damage to a scheduled monument range from fines to a prison sentence. Cadw Graffiti painted on the medieval masonry of the undercroft at St Davids Bishop's Palace What is heritage crime? Heritage crime refers to any illegal activity that harms historical assets. This includes: Theft of historic metal such as lead from church roofs Deliberate damage including graffiti or vandalism Unauthorised works on scheduled monuments Illegal metal detecting also known as \"nighthawking\" Anti-social behaviour, including littering, out of hours access or climbing on walls Rob Taylor says there needs to be education to prevent these crimes Rob Taylor, Wales' wildlife and rural crime co-ordinator, says the crimes are sometimes down to ignorance. \"People are coming to sites which they might not realise are ancient sites like burial grounds which can just be a grassy mound,\" he said. \"Areas like Gwent now have a special constable who is an archaeologist which is a fantastic addition to their team and we have police cadets involved patrolling these sites and education is really important to the public and the police. \"Everyone is aware of the problem but we need to look at how we can prevent it from happening in the first place.\" Bryn Celli Ddu passage tomb is one of the best known neolithic sites in Wales, but has seen graffiti and damage to the internal chamber Bryn Celli Ddu passage tomb on Anglesey, is one of the best known neolithic sites in Wales, dating back 5,000 years. It has recently seen graffiti and damage to the internal chamber stones. More than 40 marks were painted inside the passage and tomb, including fingerprints, handprints, diamond shapes and circles, and large symbols on the internal lintels. Ffion Reynolds, from Cadw, discovered the damage while planning an event. \"Every year we come to Bryn Celli Ddu to promote monuments for future generations of people to come and enjoy them, and while I was up here planning those events I went inside the chamber and discovered that it was covered in lots of paintings, more than maybe 40 or 50 marks in there, and it did feel like a bit of a bunker in there.\" Dr Reynolds said she believes education is key to preventing future vandalism. \"So one of the things we did as part of the project was we got permission from Cadw and worked with some of the young volunteers and we cleaned it off safely, but it was really good to involve these young volunteers because some of them were actually individuals that had been in trouble for graffiti, so in a sense this is the message, it's trying to get young people to understand the importance. \"A lot of them found the experience to be quite a privilege, so hopefully they went away and told their friends to make sure not to do this to other monuments across Wales.\" \"Leave nothing but a footprint and take nothing but a photograph\" says archaeologist Rhys Mwyn",
        "target_summary": "Criminal damage to historic buildings and scheduled monuments in Wales is increasing, with Cadw reporting that this year could see a record number of incidents.

In 1675, the Great Fire of Northampton destroyed 700 of 850 buildings and claimed 11 lives. Starting on Saturday, 13 September, events marking the anniversary are taking place including guided walks, music and theatre performances, and a main event in the Market Square the following Saturday. Art historian James Miller, who has spearheaded the project, said it was a chance to \"celebrate Northamptonshire's extraordinary resilience, civic pride and independent spirit\". The huge blaze was believed to have started from sparks from an open fire at a home on St Mary's Street and it quickly spread, with residents seeking refuge in the Market Square. Despite efforts to control it, prominent buildings including All Hallows Church were destroyed. Following a community-driven effort, the town raised  25,000 to fund reconstruction. A number of events have taken place in the past five months to commemorate what happened all those centuries ago, building up to this final week. Mr Miller said: \"The Great Fire of Northampton is a hugely significant moment in our local history and we have been thrilled to see so many people coming together in recent months to mark the 350th anniversary. \"This will be an opportunity for the county to come together to celebrate Northamptonshire's extraordinary resilience, civic pride and independent spirit. \"It is that character that shone through 350 years ago and is still very much in evidence today.\" Matt Crockett Music star and former Finedon vicar, Rev Richard Coles, is taking part in the week of commemorations The main event of the upcoming week will take place from 11:00-19:30 BST in the Market Square on 20 September, where a specially commissioned animation will premiere at 13:30 telling the story of the fire on a big screen. The film is the result of a project involving hundreds of local people answering the question: 'If Northampton burnt down again tomorrow, what would people save, what would people rebuild first and what would make it feel like our Northampton again?' Becky Carrier, of Northampton Film Festival, said: \"We're looking forward to showcasing everyone's work, as we come together as a community to commemorate this huge milestone in our town's proud history.\" There will also be an artisan market, live music, a performance from the Bach choir and displays from the police and fire service. Also on 20 September, a Service of Rededication will be held at All Saints' Church at 19:30 BST, where Rev Richard Coles - the former vicar of Finedon, Communards musician and Strictly Come Dancing contestant - will be a guest. A \"spectacular\" light show is due to be beamed on to All Saints' Church every night from 19:00, from 15 to 20 September. Fiori Musicali will perform an interpretation of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks at the church on the Thursday of that week. Father Oliver Coss, rector of All Saints, said: \"The memory of All Hallows' Church and its destruction in the Great Fire of Northampton serves as a reminder of the resilience of the town and its ability to recover and rebuild, even in the face of catastrophic events. \"The events will channel that community spirit and shine a light on the history and heritage that gives Northamptonshire such a proud identity.\" The Royal Household Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, came to Northampton in June to mark a year of commemorations Elsewhere, on Saturday 13 September, there will be Mystery Tours and guided walks from St Mary's Street through the town centre. The next day The Deco will host a performance called Northampton Remembers The Great Fire of 1675, from 16:30-18:30. From 15 September, Northampton Museum and Art Gallery will host an immersive mixed-media experience. Also from 15-17 September, the University of Northampton will hold an exhibition of artefacts loaned by Northamptonshire Archives Service.

The Terra Nova carried Captain Scott and his men on their doomed expedition to reach the South Pole more than a century ago. The British party lost the race to the pole, and died on their return journey in 1912. The footage shows the Terra Nova colonised with sea life, but key features of the wooden ship are still visible including its wheel, winch and mast. Getty Images/Royal Geographical Society The Terra Nova is forever entwined in the tragic tale of Captain Scott and his men The wreck lies 170m down off the coast of Greenland. After the polar expedition with Scott, the ship continued in service and eventually sank in 1943 while carrying supplies to US bases during World War Two. The Terra Nova was discovered in 2012 by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, but the new expedition has been the first opportunity to record extensive footage of the wreck. \"To be able to see these significant parts of the wreck, it was truly awe inspiring,\" said Leighton Rolley, Science Systems Manager at REV Ocean. \"The wheel was sat there perfectly intact amongst the debris of the aft section of the wreck. \"When you think of the people who have stood there, manoeuvred the Terra Nova through ice, like Captain Scott  It was like, wow, if that ship's wheel could talk, it could tell an amazing history.\" The Terra Nova was one of the finest polar vessels of its time and sailed for 60 years. The ship was 57m (187ft) long with a wooden hull that was a metre thick in places to help it break through the sea ice. Captain Scott's men embarked to Antarctica in 1910. A comprehensive scientific programme was planned for the Terra Nova expedition - along with the goal of being the first to reach the South Pole. Scott, along with Edward Wilson, Henry Bowers, Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans, were attempting to make history. After trekking hundreds of miles, the British party reached the pole in January 1912, but they found they had been beaten by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen. Getty Images Captain Scott and his men reached the pole but realised others had got there first A black flag, planted by Amundsen, is now on display at the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in Cambridge along with other items from the Terra Nova. \"Their hearts must have sunk seeing this black flag against the whiteness of Antarctica,\" said David Waterhouse, curator of the polar museum at SPRI. The deflated British party began their arduous return journey to their base. But they encountered unusually bad weather, and Edgar Evans died after falling while descending a glacier. Several weeks later Captain Oates left the men's tent. His last words were recorded in Scott's journal: \"I'm just going outside and may be some time.\" He was never seen again. Scott, Bowers and Wilson continued on and made a final camp, but trapped by a freezing blizzard with dwindling supplies, all three perished. A search expedition discovered their last camp just 11 miles from a resupply depot that would have provided them with food and fuel. Getty Images The Terra Nova played a crucial role in breaking the news of their death. \"In January 1913, the Terra Nova arrived at Cape Evans in the Antarctic to pick up the shore party, and they were expecting to pick up Captain Scott and his pole party at the same time,\" explained Naomi Boneham, an archivist at SPRI. \"But when they arrived they found out the sad news.\" The ship's log records that the men had died from \"exposure and want\". The vessel sailed on to New Zealand, where the tragic end of the Terra Nova expedition was announced to the world.

Aethelstan ruled England from 927 AD to 939 and united the kings of Wessex, Mercia, Northumberland and East Anglia/Danelaw under a single crown. He was also king of the Anglo Saxons from his coronation in 925, and was buried in Malmesbury Abbey in Wiltshire. David Woodman, a professor of history at Cambridge University who has written a new book about the king, said: As we approach the anniversaries of Aethelstan's coronation in 925 and the birth of England itself in 927, I would like his name to become much better known. He really deserves that.\" Aethelstan was the grandson of Alfred the Great and in 929 he conquered the last Viking kingdom, York, at the Battle of Brunanburh, making him the first Anglo-Saxon ruler of the whole of England. He died in Gloucester in 939 and was succeeded by his half-brother Edmund. Woodman, from Robinson College, said: \"There has been so much focus on 1066, the moment when England was conquered. \"It's about time we thought about its formation, and the person who brought it together in the first place.\" Prof Woodman said he blamed a lack of public relations for this. \"Aethelstan didn't have a biographer writing up his story. \"His grandfather, Alfred the Great, had the Welsh cleric Asser to sing his praises. \"And within decades of Aethelstan's death, a wave of propaganda ensured King Edgar became famous for reforming the church. This completely overshadowed Aethelstan's earlier revamping of learning and religiosity.\" Edgar was the son of Aethelstan's brother Edmund, was the great-grandson of Alfred and became king of all England in 959. Getty Images King Aethelstan's bones were buried at Malmesbury Abbey in Wiltshire Prof Woodman said some historians dismissed Aethelstan's status as England's first king on the basis that the kingdom fragmented soon after his death in 939 and the focus instead shifted to Edgar. \"Just because things broke down after Aethelstan's death doesn't mean that he didn't create England in the first place,\" he said. \"He was so ahead of his time in his political thinking, and his actions in bringing together the English kingdom were so hard-won, that it would have been more surprising if the kingdom had stayed together. \"We need to recognise that his legacy, his ways of governing and legislating, continued to shape kingship for generations afterwards.\" He added Aethelstan brought England together just as parts of continental Europe were fragmenting. \"Nobles across Europe were rising up and taking territory for themselves. \"Aethelstan made sure that he was well placed to take advantage of the unfolding of European politics by marrying a number of his half-sisters into continental ruling houses.\" Parker Library/Corpus Christi The 10th Century manuscript shows the king and a saint Prof Woodman, together with other historians including Tom Holland and Michael Wood, has been campaigning for greater public recognition of Aethelstan's creation of England in 927 AD.

The work has been carried out on Dereham Windmill, in Norfolk, to weatherproof deteriorating brick work and remove moss from the exterior. It was made derelict in 1937 and opened to the public in 2013 as a community exhibition centre hosting events and art exhibitions across five floors. Philippa Whittington, trustee of Dereham Windmill, said: \"I only moved to Dereham a couple of years ago and it's a good way of getting to know people and getting to know things that are going on and it's nice to see something that is used for the community and it is staffed entirely by volunteers.\" Maddy Jennings/BBC Philippa Whittington said repairs to the building will be ongoing with urgent repairs being carried out first Built in 1836 by millwright James Hardy for Michael Hardy, a miller and baker, it ceased work as a mill in 1937 and was left derelict more than a decade later. The building received grade II listed status in 1972 and was opened to the public in 2013. Tracey Lingfield The mill opened to the community for events and exhibitions in 2013 Previously it underwent a number of renovations including work on the sails and was boarded up for some time to keep it weatherproof after failed funding attempts. She said: \"We had a number of work we had to do in getting rid of the moss on the outside and making sure the windmill was waterproof because we were suffering from a lot of water coming in through the bricks that were deteriorating so we are very pleased at the work that has been done.\" Ms Whittington said the work will be carried out in phases, with the urgent repairs done first. She said repairs will remain ongoing due to money strains. \"The idea is to keep it looking as it was shortly after 1836 when it was built, so it's really maintaining that building and making sure it doesn't deteriorate too much. \"The bricks tend of deteriorate in the weather, we have to make sure we replace them from time to time.\" Surveys carried out also show work will need to be undertaken on the cap of the windmill too.

On Sunday, the site near Langport in Somerset will be open to public so that people can view the villa and archaeological findings for the first time. The site includes remains of an old Roman villa, a ritualistic horse burial and luxury items that were used by the occupants. Agata Socha-Paszkiewicz, regional manager at Thames Valley Archaeological Services South West, said the finds were \"quite a significant\". The people living in the villa complex were likely to have been a wealthy family Ms Socha-Paszkiewicz said: \"In the villa, there probably would have been extended family as well as servants and slaves at Roman times. \"We have surviving floors and an atrium and evidence of a mosaic, which means they were quite wealthy, upper middle class.\" She said they found fragments of fine glass and hair pins that suggest they were trading with places quite far away from Somerset. \"We have some personal hygiene objects too, like tweezers. They are different objects that can tell us what life was like, how far they traded,\" Ms Socha-Paszkiewicz said. Agata Socha-Paszkiewicz said the findings were \"quite significant\" She added that the most common items they found was pottery and animal bones, as well as more than 60 coins. However, the most interesting find was a buried horse, she said. The remains show it was buried on its side, with its legs arranged to look like it was still galloping. \"It usually would have been a ritual or spiritual act. That's quite spectacular and quite a rare find,\" Ms Socha-Paszkiewicz said. People will be able to see the horse grave as part of the open day on Sunday. Correction 3 September: This article was amended on 1 September to make clear that archaeologists uncovered a villa, rather than a village as originally reported.

The next time it will be possible to see the nearly 1,000-year-old work of art should be when it goes on display at the British Museum in September next year. However, the French art world is fiercely opposed to the project, with experts fearing the 70m-long (230ft) masterpiece is in far too delicate a state to be transported across the Channel. French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the loan when they met in London in July. The last few weeks have seen a big rise in visitor numbers at the Bayeux Museum ahead of its closure from 1 September. A new display area is being built for the tapestry, which will take at least two years. The closure   long planned   is what gave Macron the opportunity to perform his act of cultural diplomacy, committing France to loaning the tapestry to the British Museum for a year from next September. But that promise has triggered an outcry from many in the French art world. A petition   which describes the loan as a cultural crime   has drawn 60,000 signatures.

But for one former software company owner, the opportunity to bring back to life a derelict 19th Century Napoleonic fort brought with it more challenges than he had ever anticipated. Mike Conner, 52, snapped up Thorne Island near Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire for  555,000 in May 2017. The building, which was known for its parties under a previous owner, had been empty for 17 years, taking him about a year to bring it to a habitable state. Now equipped with 40 beds, four en-suite bathrooms and its own night club, the historic building has come a long way from having no running water, and is back on the market for  3m. \"Many have described it as a midlife crisis,\" Mr Conner joked. \"I really didn't know what I was getting myself into.\" Layered with history, the 100-man fort was originally built in the 1850s to protect the busy port of Milford Haven from French naval attacks. A proposal was first made in 1817 to fortify the island but it was not implemented until sometime after 1852. A date of 1854 has been carved above the island's entrance, according to the island's website. It was converted into a hotel in 1947 and hired out for birthday parties, weddings and stag parties, before being sold in 1999. By 2001 the building was bought by the Von Essen hotel group who intended to spend  4m to re-open the hotel, equipped with a cable car to allow access from the mainland. But it was largely abandoned when Mr Conner purchased the listed building, with the once-bustling party island left to grow over. Mike Conner Mike Conner bought the island back in 2017 and has devoted years to bringing it back to life \"There was no electric, no water, and any food or waste needed to come back off,\" he said. \"My wife was pretty cross when I first said I bought it, she said she would stay once it had a flushing loo, which is pretty reasonable.\" But Mr Conner did not anticipate the first flush would require cutting through 16ft (5m) of rock to get to the biodigester pump, ultimately costing him  200,000. Strutt & Parker Strutt & Parker The fortress now has 40 beds, four en-suite bathrooms and its own night club The 100-man fort was originally built in the 1850s to protect the busy port of Milford Haven from French naval attacks \"Wales has got some absolutely fabulous historic buildings that are in really sad states,\" said Mr Conner. The whole Thorne Island renovation process took nearly five years to get over the line, with six men living on the island for about four years while work was ongoing. Much of the equipment was brought in via helicopter, Mr Conner said, a process he described as \"incredibly hard\" given its location. He added getting materials was extremely difficult, but it was also a challenge for those who agreed to work on the project and live on site. \"Most people who joined the project, I still work with now,\" said Mr Conner. \"You just couldn't predict how many people want to help you.\" The men working on the island would spend stints of about two weeks on the island, unable to shower and covered in dust. \"They would charge their phones with a generator, and would have to have a dip in the sea for a wash. It was tough living,\" said Mr Conner. Mike Conner The island hosted its own festival for Mr Conner's 50th birthday, complete with a tight-rope performer Mr Conner, who trained as a design and technology teacher, said the design process excited him the most. He said he could not believe the Victorians could build something so magnificent, inspiring him to keep going. He added: \"A thousand men were working on it for two years, it was built in the same way as Stonehenge.\" \"I felt my task was really modernising it,\" Mr Conner said, adding the renovation was a task of figuring out how the new would work with the old. \"It almost feels like a tribute to their hard work and you're just really building the last little bit on top of what was already an awesome, bomb-proof construction.\" The island has \"seen everything\", according to Mr Conner, from 80-people parties to \"millpond serenity\". With \"no neighbours to upset\", the island hosted its own festival for Mr Conner's 50th birthday, complete with a tight-rope performer across the picturesque courtyard. \"People who come for a weekend are surprised when I hand them a bin liner and say it needs to come back off with them - but no-one comes here to collect the bins.\" Mike Conner The fortress, built in the 1850s, was intended to protect Pembrokeshire from French naval attacks As a former CEO, Mr Conner described his time on the island as \"incredible\" as he had to let go of everyday routines. \"We all often live by a calendar of scheduled meetings, but the island is the complete opposite - it's off grid. It feels real time, it feels like living.\" Time stops on the island, Mr Conner said, adding that with something always going on, people tended to put their phones away. \"I think that's what makes Thorne a special place, that people are present.\" Mike Conner Thorne Island operated as a hotel from 1947 to 1999, hosting weddings, hen and stag parties and birthdays Originally from Gloucestershire, Mr Conner does not live on the island but as the primary contractor spent a lot of time there during the renovation process. He initially juggled running his business alongside the venture, but sold his software company two years ago. \"It was quite cathartic for me to have this parallel life of complete chaos, which particularly through Covid was quite awesome.\" The project also lifted the lid on Mr Conner's personal heritage too, as it was not until he got the keys did he discover he is in fact a quarter Welsh, as his mum grew up at Upton Castle, Pembroke Dock. Mike Conner The island can host about 800 people, Mr Conner said Speaking of the island's future, Mr Conner said he hoped its new owner enjoys it as much as he has, but that it also has huge potential to operate as a tourist attraction, or play host to \"the most unbelievable raves\". Mr Conner said he envisaged the site offering an \"unbelievable 24-hour experience\", with the potential to host about 800 people. \"I think that would be great for Wales, but I'm not in that industry and I don't know how that works. \"If it was generating revenue, and creating jobs and sustaining itself, that would be a great outcome. \"The more people who could use it the better, as it's got to be one of the most interesting buildings in the area,\" he added. Mr Conner said more people needed to come to Wales and see what is there. \"It's a blank canvas, and the next owner can work out what it's for,\" he said, speaking of the island. \"But if there are any events there, I would crawl over broken glass to get there.\"",

The maritime miniatures were uncovered while staff at Leeds Industrial Museum were assessing and cleaning their collection of historic model ships. They are now on display as part of Engineery, an exhibition about the history of engineering and inventors. Leeds Museums and Galleries' curator of industrial history John McGoldrick said the art of model ship making was as \"old as shipbuilding itself\". He said: \"Each of the model ships in our collection has been made at a unique and very different moment in history, but what unites them is the ingenuity and attention to detail, which has gone into capturing each minute feature. \"That level of dedication and commitment speaks volumes about how impressive these ships were and how much they inspired and motivated each model maker to reach such incredible feats of creativity.\" Leeds Industrial Museum A model of the RMS Queen Elizabeth, once the biggest passenger ship ever built, is also on display The model bone ship carved more than 200 years ago is a replica of a 19th Century warship. It is believed to be an example of the type carved by French captives in British prisons and aboard ships during the Napoleonic Wars. Using leftover bone, the prisoners were also known to employ hair, clothing and jewellery in a model, which normally took a prisoner years to complete. Other ships in the museum collection include wool clipper Cromdale, built in Glasgow in 1891. After narrowly escaping disaster on her maiden voyage when she was hit by 300ft high icebergs, she later ran aground in thick fog, ploughing into cliffs off the coast of Cornwall, where the wreck is visible today. Several members of the crew died, including one who was reportedly eaten by a shark in Montevideo Bay. Also part of the collection is a scale replica of the RMS Queen Elizabeth.

        "content": "The battle to rescue an historic pub from ruin 17 August 2025 Share Save Alex McIntyre BBC News, West Midlands Share Save Historic England The Golden Lion pub was dismantled and moved to Cannon Hill Park in 1911 In the grounds of a 19th Century park lies an old, derelict, timber-framed pub which has had to withstand both the passage of time and adversity. Almost destroyed in the English Civil Wars, it was then dismantled and relocated before, in the 20th Century, almost being burnt down by suffragettes. The story of the Grade II listed Golden Lion in Birmingham is one of a \"rare and remarkable\" survival, conservationists say, and many believe the community has a duty to rescue it from ruin. Leaders of the restoration project received a boost in August after Historic England awarded them  344,265 to make vital repairs. The Golden Lion was one of 37 heritage sites in England - and four in the West Midlands - to receive funding, which also included the Bethesda Methodist Chapel in Stoke-on-Trent - known as the \"cathedral of the Potteries\". With the pub, which was originally based in Deritend High Street, its early history is \"shrouded in mystery\" though some of its timbers date back to the 15th Century, the Birmingham Conservation Trust says. The building was rebuilt between 1616 and 1644, thought to be as a result of damage during a Royalist attack on Birmingham in the Civil Wars era. Historic England The Golden Lion has deteriorated over the last 20 years Since then, the Golden Lion has been used as a pub, culler's house, six small homes, a scrap shop and a rangers' hut, the trust said. It was dismantled by the Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeological Society in 1911 before it was rebuilt at its current location in Cannon Hill Park, where it was used as a cricket pavilion. During the votes for women protests, it was badly damaged in an arson attack carried out by suffragettes in 1912. Sarah Hayes Sarah Hayes, pictured with a visitor at the site, said the building was in \"desperate\" need of repair Sarah Hayes, museum and trust director at the conservation trust, said: \"It's a rare and remarkable survival of a timber-framed building in Birmingham, one that has stood the test of time and survived beyond all odds.\" But the building has stood empty and unused for 20 years, falling into a dilapidated state, with scaffolding currently surrounding the site. The trust has been working with Birmingham City Council to try and bring it back into community use, though the grant from Historic England, a spokesperson said, would make the site secure and watertight but not yet usable. The repair work will include fixing the roof, chimneys, walls, floors, windows and doors, as well as adding French doors to the rear before the scaffolding is removed. Ms Hayes said it was \"our turn\" to help the much-loved building in \"desperate\" need of help. \"In many ways it feels like the last chance for us to act before its condition becomes beyond repair,\" she added. Historic England Bethesda Methodist Chapel was known as the \"cathedral of the Potteries\" Meanwhile in Stoke-on-Trent, charity Re-Form Heritage said it was \"delighted and grateful\" to receive  521,737 of funding for its work to rejuvenate Bethesda Methodist Chapel in Hanley. The Grade II* listed building on Albion Street, Hanley, was first built in 1798, according to the Friends of Bethesda Chapel. At first, it seated 600 people but was deemed to be too small in 1813, so the back wall was removed and the building extended to fit 1,000 people. As the \"fire of Methodism\" grew in the Potteries, the Friends of Bethesda Chapel said it was once again judged to be too small in 1819 so the extension was pulled down and replaced. The chapel reopened to worshippers in 1820 and was \"full to excess\" with about 3,000 people in attendance. Historic England said the chapel stood as a \"testament to the power and influence of the Methodist Church\" in 19th Century Stoke-on-Trent. Re-Form Heritage The chapel was extended on two occasions due to a growing number of worshippers Since its closure in 1985, the Friends of Bethesda Chapel and Historic Chapels Trust have been maintaining the site. Conservation specialists Re-Form Heritage have taken control of the efforts to bring the building back into use. The grant will go towards repairing plasterwork, timber panelling, staircases, east lobby and ceiling coving, a spokesperson said. The charity said the renovated site would \"provide a more attractive, comfortable and accessible space\". Under the plans, the building will be used as a mixed-use space in the future, housing creative arts education specialist Pinc College and feature exhibition and performance space. Re-Form Heritage chief executive Alasdair Brooks said: \"The funds will allow us to move forward with bringing the much-loved Cathedral of the Potteries back into community use. \"We're excited at being able to progress our work at this important Grade II* listed building over the coming months.\"",

        "content": "Exploring the catacombs which lie under a city 16 August 2025 Share Save Elliot Ball BBC News, West Midlands Share Save Birmingham City Council Archives A catacomb at Key Hill Cemetery opened in 1836 and was Birmingham's first The fact that a labyrinth of catacombs lies beneath one of the UK's biggest cities may surprise many. Rome or Paris could spring to mind for their underground chambers but Birmingham? But it is true - the UK's second city once housed more than 500 bodies in large, private vaults, dug out underground and used until the middle of the 20th Century. The first location to house them opened in 1836 at Key Hill Cemetery in the city's Jewellery Quarter before nearby Warstone Lane Cemetery opened 12 years later. Tour guide Richard Beardall said, at the time, the vaults cost up to  30 - about  3,000 in today's money. They were inspired by concepts across the continent before the British climate put an end to them in the late 1950s. \"The idea for the catacombs came from Rome where the bodies would dry out and mummify but, with the British climate, the bodies would instead go mouldy and smelly,\" Mr Beardall said. \"The coffins were metal-lined and supposed to be sealed but they weren't, because they tended to explode due to the gasses that built up in them. \"You can imagine a small room with 10 bodies decaying in them wasn't very pleasant. \"The idea was to go and see granny's coffin and go to polish the brass. \"It was a nice idea but, due to the practicalities, people just didn't like the idea of it.\" Heritage England A vault for a family cost about  30 each, according to Mr Beardall The 56-year-old is the principal tour guide for the two catacombs with a voluntary group, the Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries, formed in 2004. \"We primarily keep the place clean and tidy, raise funds to restore headstones, as well as reconnect families with their ancestors,\" Mr Beardall said. \"The responsibility [for the cemeteries] is with the council but we work very closely with them.\" The Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries The Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries maintain both cemeteries Describing what lies beneath the surface in Key Hill's catacomb, Mr Beardall said: \"Key Hill has a long linear arrangement but with a curve at each end so look like an elongated 'S'. \"They are also two-tiered but the lower level is below ground level and is no longer accessible or visible. \"There is a small interior section in a T-shaped tunnel. This is accessible and we hold tours on our open days.\" The Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries Each vault was for one family and could house about 10 bodies, according to Mr Beardall In contrast, he explained Warstone Lane's catacomb was below a now-demolished church in a semi-circular arrangement, on two levels. \"There would be a gate of wrought iron, possibly with glass backing and coffins would have been visible to all visitors to the cemetery,\" he said. \"Sadly these have now all been bricked up. \"A number [of vaults] were full while the cemetery was in operation so the gate would have been removed and a memorial fixed to seal the opening.\" Heritage England The catacombs at Warstone Lane were on two levels and tunnelled beneath a now-demolished church Both catacombs stopped being used in the late 1950s when they were no longer profitable and were bought by Birmingham City Council. Asked why it was important to preserve the Key Hill and Warstone Lane, Mr Beardall explained: \"Key Hill is a Grade II* listed cemetery because of its age and the people that are in there. \"We have the major founding fathers of Birmingham in the two cemeteries. \"It's important that we honour them and keep their final resting places intact.\" Key Hill in particular houses some famous names including Marie Bethell, claimed to be the country's first female reporter, along with Alfred Bird, the inventor of baking powder and egg-free custard and former politician Joseph Chamberlain.

They ceased use by the late 1950s and are now maintained by a volunteer group, preserving these Grade II* listed sites and the remains of many of Birmingham's founding figures.",

        "content": "How a 'moth-eaten rag' became a war memorial 16 August 2025 Share Save Katy Prickett BBC News, Cambridgeshire Share Save The Long Shop The union jack is the centrepiece of a memorial made to remember the men of the 4th Battalion who died while prisoners of the Japanese A small coastal town is home to an unusual World War Two war memorial created by soldiers in memory of comrades who died while prisoners of war (POW). It was made by men from the 4th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment, who were captured at the fall of Singapore in 1942. They spent more than three years as slave labourers for the Japanese army, much of it at Chungkai camp in Thailand. The centrepiece of the memorial in Leiston, Suffolk, is a union jack, used in the camp during funeral services and brought home by Corp Hermie Bailey after he and the other survivors were finally liberated. In 1952, the veterans transformed the \"moth-eaten rag\" into a tribute to the POWs of the 4th Battalion who died and to mark the 10th anniversary of their capture. \"Sometimes people just refer to it as a flag, but it's not just a flag - the flag is just the centrepiece of a very, very interesting and unusual war memorial,\" said Taff Gillingham, chairman of the Friends of the Suffolk Regiment. Norfolk Museums Service Men from Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire regiments joined other prisoners of war and slave labour to toil on the Burma to Thailand railway In 1942, the 4th Battalion was among many Allied divisions rushed to defend Singapore, in the wake of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour. After fierce fighting but against impossible odds, the British, Australian and Indian forces were ordered to surrender. Somehow the 11ft by 6ft (3.3m by 1.8m) flag went with the men of the 4th Battalion when they were transferred to Chungkai camp, said Mr Gillingham. This was a POW camp used during the construction of the infamous Burma-Thailand Railway, and today it is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery. About 13,000 Allied prisoners of war died during the railway project, plus an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 civilians, according to the commission. Mr Gillingham said the 4th and 5th battalions of the Suffolk Regiment were about 2,000 strong when they disembarked at Singapore in 1942, but more than a third of them had died by the end of the war. The POWs were allowed to build a little wooden chapel at Chungkai for church services, where the flag rested on its altar. \"And every time one of the soldiers died, it was used for the funeral service,\" Mr Gillingham said. \"Starved, beaten and executed for the slightest misdemeanours - the thing that inspires me is their resilience and their ingenuity, making medicines from plants that they'd find in the jungle, for example.\" The Long Shop Every year on VJ Day (Victory over Japan), the people of Leiston remember the men from the town who never came back, said historian Taff Gillingham Every aspect of the memorial has a specific link to the 4th Battalion, a territorial unit which recruited from the Leiston area. Mr Gillingham said: \"The frame is just as interesting [as the flag], in that it's made from wood salvaged from Southwold Pier and the metal frame it sits on was made by the engineering works of Garretts, the engineering works in Leiston, so it was a proper local project. \"And the colours behind the flag mean something too - they are the colours of the Pacific Star, the medal that all the Far East prisoners of war were given.\" Today, it is owned by the Friends of the Suffolk Regiment and is on long-term loan to the town's Long Shop Museum. When the men of the 4th Battalion were liberated at the end of the war, many, including Corp Bailey, continued to serve in the territorials for years, with weekly training and annual camps. Underneath the memorial is a plaque which describes it as \"a moth-eaten rag on a worm-eaten pole\". It also records how the union jack was \"hoisted to the top of the pole in the camp by the men of the battalion who survived three years of living hell\". Mr Gillingham said: \"It's often said to be the only war memorial based on an artefact brought back from the field, and it's certainly the only one I can think of, but it's a lovely thing because it has a direct connection with the place, and the people, with those who died.\" A service to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day and the end of World War Two will be held at the memorial at 10:30 BST.",

Wing Commander Cuthbert \"Cubby\" Lander from Northumberland led the 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment at the Battle of Meiktila in March 1945 and was killed aged 30 during a night-time patrol. His pivotal role in the battle was remembered with an annual dinner at the regiment's headquarters, RAF Honington, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Wing Cdr Lander's niece Penny Fell, 81, said: \"It's absolutely times like this VJ Day milestone that we should be remembering the sacrifices that war calls for. \"And - both for the regiment and our uncle - where the sacrifice has been great and the contribution significant, there isn't a shelf life on honour or gratitude.\" VJ Day stands for Victory over Japan Day and commemorates 15 August 1945 when Japan surrendered, bringing the Second World War to a complete end. Fell family handout Penny Fell (left) and her late sister Juliet Francis were invited to the RAF Regiment's annual dinner in honour of their uncle in 2020 The Battle of Meiktila was both a significant milestone in the reconquest of Burma by Allied forces from Japan and one of \"the greatest and proudest battle honours\" for the newly-formed regiment, said the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund. \"The unusual thing about Lander is he was a wing commander, but he was leading a clearance patrol of the airfield when he died, partly because they'd lost so many officers and also because he was a man of action who the troops looked up to terrifically,\" said Warrant Officer Mac MacDonald, 60, manager of the RAF Regiment Heritage Centre. \"Not many other wing commanders would have done so or been able to - and in other circumstances, he would have been awarded some kind of medallic recognition,\" WO MacDonald added. Fell family handout The wing commander - known as Bill in the RAF - married during the war and his widow Eileen remained close to the family The capture of the important command and supply centre at Meiktila was crucial to the plan of General Bill Slim - who led the 14th Army in the Burma campaign - to prevent the Japanese army from organising effective action. The 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment had been set up in 1942 to provide a ground defence force for the air force and its men had the specialist skills needed to defend Meiktila's airstrips. Mrs Fell said: \"Slim - commander of the 14th Army - saw that morale and supplies were the two things they needed to beat the legendarily fierce Japanese fighters and the airfields were crucial to his strategy of getting men and supplies to the places they needed to be.\" The Japanese army rushed in reinforcements to besiege the town, desperate to recapture Meiktila. Two runways could not be held at night, so Japanese patrols would move in under darkness and establish themselves on the airstrips. The 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment gunners had to clear the airstrips every day, before essential supply, casualty evacuation and fighter aircraft could land. Fell family handout After his father died, the Lander family moved to Kirkley, just north of Newcastle, where Cuthbert started school (front row far right) Wing Cdr Lander was responsible for coordinating the actions of the 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment squadrons and flights [platoons] and often led night patrols. In his diary, he wrote: \"Mortars and snipers gave us hell and it took an hour to get our casualties clear. \"Bullets were flying in all directions which didn't make our task pleasant... not a man relaxed his efforts.\" Lander and his runner, Leading Aircraftman Dakers, were shot dead on 24 March. WO MacDonald said: \"The capture of Meiktila was an essential part of Gen Slim's plan to beat the Japanese and (if they had not retained it) the rest of the campaign would have been very difficult and very different. \"People talk about the battles of Kohima and Imphal as the turning points in the Burma campaign, but the thing that cemented those achievements was the battle for Meiktila.\" Air Historical Branch RAF Crown Copyright A newspaper in March 1945 reported the 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment were using a captured Japanese foxhole as a shower, featuring Wing Cdr Lander (right) Wing Cdr Lander was the youngest of seven and born in Northumberland, where his father was a coachman on an estate at Simonburn near Hexham. His childhood was one of \"considerable poverty\" after his father died when he was four, said Mrs Fell, who lives near Cardiff. She is too young to remember \"Uncle Cubby\", but was brought up on stories of his charisma and sense of fun and the loss has been remembered down the generations. The family remained close to his widow Eileen who never remarried, and Mrs Fell chose Cuthbert as the middle name for one of her sons. \"By 1942, he joined the RAF Regiment as a pilot officer and it's quite something to go from joining a regiment and becoming a wing commander that fast, even with dead man's shoes,\" she said. Air Historical Branch RAF Crown Copyright In a letter of condolence to his widow, Air Vice Marshal Vincent praised Wing Cdr Lander's \"wonderful leadership\" In 1990, Leading Aircraftman Dennis Leftley remembered \"there was a feeling of great loss that day [when Wing Cdr Lander died] - he was a great bloke to the lads\". Mrs Fell said: \"Afterwards, another of Cubby's men described him as 'the bright star that shone in the darkness of Meiktila'. \"He paid the ultimate sacrifice for a very important cause and there's just me and one nephew left alive now, so this is our last shout to say how wonderful it would be if he could be remembered for what he has contributed.\"",

Noel Duckworth, George Easingwood and John Beckett were captured with the 2nd Battalion The Cambridgeshire Regiment at the fall of Singapore in February 1942. They were a chaplain whose courage prevented a massacre; a sergeant who tirelessly cared for the starving and injured; and a captain who created a hidden radio to provide morale-boosting news updates. \"They found themselves in this unimaginably awful situation and did not give up or give in to selfishness - it's an incredible story,\" said Felix Jackson, from Ely Museum. The 2nd Battalion was a territorial division, \"a unit imbedded in the local Ely population, quite often it was sons following fathers,\" said Mr Jackson. In 1941, they were heading to India for garrison duty, when the attack on Pearl Harbour took place and the ship they were on was rushed to Singapore. After fierce fighting but against impossible odds, the British, Australian and Indian forces were ordered to surrender. The Cambridgeshire Regiment was about 1,900-strong when it reached Singapore, but by 1945, 784 officers and men had died fighting or as prisoners. The conditions the Japanese Army inflicted upon the prisoners of war (POWs) have since become a by-word for brutality and cruelty, while millions of civilians also died in the South East Asian countries the army occupied. The padre who 'used his charisma' Cambridgeshire Regiment Research Trust Chaplain Noel Duckworth pictured in late 1945. He rowed for Great Britain in the 1936 Olympic Games Chaplain Noel Duckworth (1912-1980) loved rowing - and the sport would go on to save his life. At 5ft 2in (1.6m), the vicar's son from Yorkshire coxed for his college at the University of Cambridge, for the university boat club - and for Great Britain during the 1936 Berlin Olympics, said Mr Jackson. By the outbreak of World War Two he was a Church of England priest and he joined the 2nd Battalion as its padre - the name given to Army chaplains. As Singapore fell, field hospitals were being overrun and the injured were being executed, so the order went out that it was every man for himself. \"Amazingly, Royal Army Medical Corps personnel elect to stay behind and look after the wounded and Noel Duckworth sees it as his duty to do the same,\" said Mr Jackson, co-founder of the Cambridgeshire Regiment Research Trust. The group he was with was captured and the order to kill was about to be given. The padre's story featured on the TV programme This is Your Life in 1959 Mr Jackson said: \"Noel steps forward and starts berating the Japanese officer and everyone around him, giving them a proper parade-ground telling off. \"There's a moment of hesitation and the officer recognises Noel from his rowing days - the Japanese had a rowing team at the Olympics - and, according to multiple reports, this stops the massacre, all because he stood up and did what he could.\" This episode set the pattern for the way he behaved during his years of captivity, paying the price with \"incredibly severe beatings\" for standing up for his fellow POWs, said Mr Jackson. \"He would use his charisma to trade with the guards for food or medical supplies - everyone speaks so highly of him as this remarkable chap, getting up to a little bit of mischief,\" he added. After the war he worked in Ghana, before returning to Cambridge to become chaplain of the newly founded Churchill College. The selfless medic Ely Museum Ely's Sgt George Easingwood (1919-1987) was awarded the British Empire Medal for his bravery and devotion as a medic, which saved many of the prisoners \"George Easingwood's story is another one of moral courage, he is caring from the off,\" said Mr Jackson. At the time of capture, the grocer's assistant from Ely was an acting medical sergeant, triaging patients alongside a doctor. He was initially held at Changi Prison before being sent to join the POWs toiling relentlessly as slave labour while building the Burma to Thailand railway. They were also expected to work on docks, airfields, in coalmines, shipbuilding yards, steel and copper works. So in 1944, Sgt Easingwood was among thousands of Allied POWs crammed into unmarked and disease-riddled \"hell ships\", sent to become slave labour in Japan. Ely Museum He was selfless in his care of the men he was with, who were suffering from tropical diseases and malaria, malnutrition and torture, said Mr Jackson Mr Jackson said: \"He is sent to Tokyo knowing that when the Allied invasion comes, they're all going to be killed - except the atomic bombs are dropped and the war is over.\" On his return home, he was nominated for a British Empire Medal by fellow-survivors. \"The citation talks about the incredible care he showed during a terrible cholera outbreak in 1943 and how he looked after 750 men during the voyage to Japan, despite suffering from [tropical disease] beri-beri and marked malnutrition, while refusing to rest when his medical officer said he was too ill to work,\" said Mr Jackson. Sgt Easingwood remained in Ely for much of the rest of his life, marrying and staying active in a Far Eastern Prisoner of War (FEPOW) club until his death. Saved by a Rolex Ely Museum John Beckett was a young captain when he was captured, but on liberation went on to become a colonel and is seen here with Queen Elizabeth II in 1955 \"Within four months of capture, John Beckett comes up with a plan to scavenge whatever machinery and electronics they can to create a rudimentary radio,\" said Mr Jackson. \"He knew there was huge personal risk, if the radio was found he risked beatings, torture and probable execution - but morale is suffering and he felt the best way to help that is to get hold of news about the war.\" Capt Beckett (1914 to 1987) was a solicitor in Ely before the war, who had followed his uncle Lt Col Archer and taken a commission in the Cambridgeshire Regiment. \"He described the absolute shock of being told to surrender and within a few weeks he was getting a bit itchy and keen to push back so comes up with the idea of making a radio - it's this quiet resistance that's quite remarkable,\" said Mr Jackson. Ely Museum Capt Beckett would seek out men from the Royal Corps of Signals to help create a much smaller radio (above) which remained in use until mid-1944 The initial radio was hidden in the latrine's roof, but it was too big to be portable so over time, a radio was developed small enough to fit into his 8in by 6in (20cm by 15cm) water bottle. Captain Beckett was the one listening to the updates and writing them down. Mr Jackson said: \"There was one occasion, where a Japanese sentry stumbles across him doing this, works out what is going on, but see his fancy Rolex watch and takes that in exchange for not reporting him.\" He also kept a secret list in his bible of the names of the men who went missing or died - or got moved into different work groups - as a record for when the war ended. On his return to Ely, he married, remained in the territorials, and ended up becoming its commanding officer. Ely Museum A group of Allied prisoners of war celebrating after liberation Mr Jackson said: \"They were such remarkable men and it's important we remember them because they were people from the communities we live in now. \"A vicar, a grocer's assistant and a solicitor - people who risked everything to help those around them and are beacons of humanity and resistance to evil.\" Follow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

The Peebles Hoard, which had lain undisturbed for 3,000 years before it was discovered in 2020, was acquired by National Museums Scotland (NMS) last year. It comprises more than 500 unusual bronze and organic objects and components, many \"without archaeological parallel anywhere in the world\".

NMS said the defining technological characteristic of the Bronze Age was the widespread use and production of bronze - an alloy of copper and tin that is usually a deep golden colour. However, conservation of the Peebles Hoard has revealed rare silver-coloured objects from an era when silver was unknown. Crown Copyright Hundreds of pieces were discovered by a metal detectorist in 2020 Analysis has revealed the colour is the result of high levels of tin on the surface. This is thought to be the product of a deliberate enrichment technique by highly-skilled craftspeople. The bronze objects emerged from the earth encrusted with earth and green copper patina - a film produced by oxidation After months of careful preparatory work to stabilise, assess and document the material in the hoard, conservators are painstakingly removing thousands of years of dirt and corrosion to reveal the \"spectacular lustre\" of the original surface. Duncan McGlynn It has been estimated conservation work will take three years to complete It is estimated that it will take three years to complete the conservation work on the discovery. Bethan Bryan, conservator at NMS, said: \"Working on the conservation of the Peebles Hoard is a rare privilege and definitely a career highpoint. \"As well as removing dirt and corrosion, it is essential that we preserve as much precious organic material as possible for future research. \"Getting to this point has been a challenging and incredibly time-intensive process, but the moment the silvery surface began to emerge was magical, a secret revealed after 3,000 years.\" NMS The items are estimated to have lain undisturbed for 3,000 years",
        "target_summary": "The Peebles Hoard, discovered in 2020 and acquired by National Museums Scotland, contains over 500 unusual Bronze Age bronze and organic objects. Initial conservation work revealed some of these items have an exceptionally rare silver-coloured finish, which is unexpected for the era. Analysis has shown this silvery glow is due to high levels of tin on the objects' surface, likely the result of a deliberate enrichment technique by highly-skilled craftspeople.",

        "content": "The Egyptologist and former minister of antiquities will be the first Arab to lead the UN s cultural organisation. The board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has nominated Egypt s Khaled el-Enany, an academic and former minister of tourism and antiquities, as its next head, before the organisation s general conference next month. If confirmed, el-Enany, a professor of Egyptology at Cairo s Helwan University, would become the first Arab director-general of the organisation, which oversees the UN s handling of cultural heritage, alongside international cooperation in other areas, including science and education. The former minister campaigned widely for the role, which was also contested by Firmin Edouard Matoko of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabriela Ramos of Mexico, who withdrew from the race earlier this year. The decision by the board, which represents 58 of the agency s 194 member states, is expected to be finalised at a meeting of UNESCO s general assembly in Uzbekistan next month. The organisation s next leader will replace France s former Minister of Culture Audrey Azoulay, who has served in the role since 2017. Azoulay notably helped lead a high-profile effort to rebuild the ancient Iraqi city of Mosul after it was devastated during fighting between the ISIL (ISIS) armed group and combined US and Iraqi forces. El-Enany s nomination comes as the Paris-based UN body continues to face political challenges, including in its work of choosing which cultural heritage sites to help preserve from threats including wars, pollution and climate change.  The organisation is also set to face an 8 percent funding cut at the end of 2026, when the United States again formally withdraws its membership, along with its funding. It will be the second time that the Trump administration has pulled the US out of the UN cultural organisation in protest at its members  decision to admit the State of Palestine as a member in 2011. The State of Palestine is also a Permanent Observer State member of the UN General Assembly, where more than 80 percent of member states now back its full membership. Explaining the US decision to withdraw again, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce claimed that allowing Palestine to remain a member of UNESCO had  contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organisation . Israel left UNESCO at the end of 2018. The organisation has been remotely monitoring damage to cultural heritage sites in the Gaza Strip during Israel s war, and says it has verified damage to a total of 110 sites since October 7, 2023, including 13 religious sites, 77 buildings of historical or artistic interest, three depositories of moveable cultural property, nine monuments, one museum and seven archaeological sites. El-Enani, 54, worked earlier in his career as a tour guide at ancient Egyptian sites, earned a doctorate in France and became a famed Egyptologist before serving in government. He was minister of antiquities and, later, tourism, under Egypt s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi from 2016 to 2022. El-Sisi welcomed the news of el-Enani s nomination, calling it a  historic achievement that shall be added to Egypt s diplomatic and cultural record and to the achievements of the Arab and African peoples . During his tenure in government, el-Enani oversaw the start of mega-tourism projects, including the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo, the Jewish Temple and multiple ancient discoveries that helped revive the country s battered tourism sector. He is expected to focus on UNESCO s cultural programmes, and has pledged to continue UNESCO s work to fight anti-Semitism and religious intolerance, according to The Associated Press news agency.",

Archaeologists in drought-hit Iraq have discovered 40 ancient tombs after water levels in the country s largest reservoir declined, according to an antiquities official. The tombs, believed to be more than 2,300 years old, were unearthed at the edges of the Mosul Dam reservoir in the Khanke region of Duhok province in the country s north.  So far, we have discovered approximately 40 tombs,  Bekas Brefkany, the director of antiquities in Duhok and leader of the archaeological work at the site, said on Saturday. His team surveyed the area in 2023 but spotted only parts of a few tombs. They were able to work on the site only when water levels dropped  to their lowest  this year, Brefkany said.  Drought allows us to do excavation work  In recent years, archaeologists have uncovered ruins dating back thousands of years in the same area, as a result of droughts that have plagued Iraq for five consecutive years.  The droughts have a significant impact on many aspects, like agriculture and electricity. But, for us archaeologists   it allows us to do excavation work,  Brefkany said. The newly discovered tombs are believed to date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period, according to Brefkany. He added that his team is working to excavate the tombs to transfer them to the Duhok Museum for further study and preservation, before the area is submerged again.  Iraq, which is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, has been facing rising temperatures, chronic water shortages and year-on-year droughts. Authorities have warned that this year has been one of the driest since 1933 and that water reserves were down to only 8 percent of their full capacity. They also blame upstream dams built in neighbouring Iran and Turkiye for dramatically lowering the flow of the once-mighty rivers Tigris and Euphrates, which have irrigated Iraq for millennia.",

        "content": "It s amazing how little art has changed since the decade of grunge rock and Ally McBeal. We re stuck in a rut and can t move on writes Jason Farago. How long does it take for the present to become history? Once our museums and universities were guardians of the past, but now they seem ever more concerned with the here and now. But what was once new must inevitably turn old, and historically minded curators are beginning to turn their gaze to the 1990s: a decade that feels like only yesterday and yet like ancient history all at the same time. They ve been coming thick and fast, these  what were the  90s?  surveys. In 2013, the New Museum in New York presented NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star, which filled the museum s entire building with art from the year of Bill Clinton s inauguration. Last year, the Centre Pompidou s satellite space in Metz unveiled 1984 1999: The Decade, which showcased the generation that put French art back on the global art world s map. And opening this week at New Jersey s Montclair Art Museum is Come As You Are: Art of the 1990s, a hotly anticipated full-scale survey of the last decade of the last millennium. The passing of the 1990s into history may feel a little sudden but this wave of 1990s shows marks a welcome effort to impose historical rigour on a period we still sometimes call  contemporary . By insisting on the distance between then and now, and by placing the works in the context of their times   Clinton and Blair, Bosnia and Rwanda, grunge rock and Ally McBeal   these shows do the great service of showing how this art came to be. Yet these exhibitions do something else too: they reveal that the gap between then and now might not be as gaping as presupposed, and that, in aesthetic terms at least, the  90s are still going strong 15 years past their expiration date. Dream of the  90s If you want to understand the art of the 1990s, you have to start not with aesthetics but with economics. The 1980s, especially in New York but also in cities from Cologne to Tokyo, was a period of media excess and frenzied stock market speculation, typified by aggressive large-scale painting that sold for lots of money. But in 1991 the art market crashed spectacularly, closing galleries right and left. Prices fell by more than 50% for many contemporary artists, and average art prices didn t recover their pre-crash height until 2003. (Now they are even higher, of course.) Art in the 1990s, in economic terms but also in aesthetic ones, went through a period of retrenchment and rethinking.  Value in everything is being questioned,  said Mary Boone, the influential 80s art dealer, in the midst of the crash.  The psychology in the 80's was excess; in the 90's, it's about conservation.  What typified the art of those days? Race, sexuality and multiculturalism were hotly debated at the start of the decade, notably at the controversial Whitney Biennial of 1993, of which the most famous artwork was an admissions button, designed by Daniel J Martinez, reading  I Can t Imagine Ever Wanting to Be White.  The rise of the World Wide Web had a strong influence on art production. So did celebrity culture, especially in Britain, where the Young British Artists hit the galleries and the tabloid front pages. The big theme was globalisation. That was reflected not only in the art of the time, but in the institutions that arose from it: the 1990s was the decade when biennials, from Johannesburg to Montreal to the South Korean city of Gwangju, became central nodes in artistic production and transmission.",

Despite glitches, it offers a glimpse of a future in which there are no linguistic misunderstandings   especially ones that change the course of history. BBC Culture looks back at the greatest mistranslations of the past, with a 19th-Century astronomer finding signs of intelligent life on Mars and a US president expressing sexual desire for an entire nation. Life on Mars When Italian astronomer Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli began mapping Mars in 1877, he inadvertently sparked an entire science-fiction oeuvre. The director of Milan s Brera Observatory dubbed dark and light areas on the planet s surface  seas  and  continents    labelling what he thought were channels with the Italian word  canali . Unfortunately, his peers translated that as  canals , launching a theory that they had been created by intelligent lifeforms on Mars. Convinced that the canals were real, US astronomer Percival Lowell mapped hundreds of them between 1894 and 1895. Over the following two decades he published three books on Mars with illustrations showing what he thought were artificial structures built to carry water by a brilliant race of engineers. One writer influenced by Lowell s theories published his own book about intelligent Martians. In The War of the Worlds, which first appeared in serialised form in 1897, H G Wells described an invasion of Earth by deadly Martians and spawned a sci-fi subgenre. A Princess of Mars, a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs published in 1911, also features a dying Martian civilisation, using Schiaparelli s names for features on the planet.",

Opened in 1917 on the ground floor of the Homer Loughlin Building and designed by the English-born architect John B Parkinson, the market has served succeeding generations of immigrants. Today, 80% of those who shop here daily are Hispanic Americans, a fact reflected in the wealth of fresh fruit, vegetables and Spanish delis. Most of these, though, display their wares under all-American neon signs hung from the reinforced concrete beams of an innovative building where Frank Lloyd Wright, the most famous of all US architects, once ran his studio. The architecture of Seattle s Pike Place Market is a rambling affair in a number of different styles dating from 1907, when this waterfront enterprise first opened. Located on several hillside levels, the nine-acre (3,600 sq m) market offers everything from the freshest Pacific fish to local crafts. A publicly owned development, it houses some 500 people as well as feeding and delighting many more. Of course you can dine on sushi here, although in its early days and before Congress passed an act in 1942 sending them to internment camps for the duration of the Second World War, Japanese-American families had made their special mark here, owning at least 80% of the market stalls.

Despite intense competition from opulent palazzos and mesmerising art-laced churches, few visitors to Venice can fail to be impressed by the Pescheria, the covered fish market set cheek-by-gill with Rialto Bridge. A fish market has existed near here since 1097, although the existing Neo-Gothic building designed by architect Domenico Rupolo and painter Cesare Laurenti dates from 1907. Look up at the capitals crowning the columns supporting the roof: they sport fish heads rather than classically correct volutes or acanthus leaves.

        "content": "The US TV series examines the Cold War from the perspective of Russian agents   and offers up a radical revision of history, writes Eric Kohn. While the US may struggle with its own history of espionage, its CIA and FBI have nothing on the KGB. The Soviet security agency has been one of the great faceless  villains  in the American imagination since World War Two. Since so many of the Cold War s  battles  took place behind closed doors, some of the conflict s key moments   and even players   may be unknown to history. Hollywood usually responded to this lack of information about  what was really happening  by portraying the Cold War as a battle against Russians who are villainous caricatures   with the KGB as a one-note, shadowy threat. The US TV series The Americans, which begins its third season on 28 January, challenges that notion by giving Soviet agents a familiar face   one we are supposed to empathise with. This is a radical shift in perspective, the full implications of which haven t been examined as closely as they should. In the series, Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) are Soviet agents posing as a quiet suburban family in the early 1980s. As The Americans explores the agents' ongoing missions to disrupt US interests and juggle other daunting orders from their handlers, it adopts the twisting structure of a classic espionage tale. The disguises they wear when assuming different identities, marked by innumerable ridiculous wigs, wouldn't feel out of place in an episode of The A-Team or Alias. But the show has a distinctive edge thanks to creator Joe Weisberg, a former CIA agent, whose storylines continually emphasise the similarities between the spies and their American foes. The result is a subtle parody of American suburban life: Philip and Elizabeth grapple with how best to raise their children, navigate infidelities and jealousies, deal with  bedroom problems  and intrusive neighbours. It s the stuff of soap operas, except that this nuclear family has a hand in events that might actually go nuclear. The bad guys don't just look like  us ; they struggle like us, too. Seeing red A few years ago, Sleeper Cell, another programme on US TV, attempted a similar concept but set in the present day   with Islamic terrorists fighting the CIA on American soil. Yet its plot felt hyperbolic and out of touch with reality. The lure of dramatic embellishment also holds back other popular shows about domestic terrorism such as Homeland and 24, which offer escapist fantasies about American security measures but struggle to top each increasingly outlandish plot point with events that are even more extreme.",

What do you think about when you hear the words  ancient Greece ? The conventional view is that the ancient Greeks provided the bedrock for Western civilisation. After all, they invented democracy, philosophy and drama. But it would be a mistake to imagine them as exclusively rational. Their society was shaped by strange and primal forces as much as the guiding light of reason. And nowhere is this more visible than in their art. One of the most intriguing aspects of ancient Greek art is its glut of fantastical creatures. When we consider Greek art, we tend to envisage marble statues of Olympian gods   but gorgons, griffins, centaurs and sphinxes are actually just as common. Lots of them were on show recently in New York, decorating all sorts of objects in the Metropolitan Museum of Art s exhibition Assyria to Iberia at the Dawn of the Classical Age. What was the significance of all these ferocious supernatural beasts? Fantastical animals were already part of the repertoire of Aegean craftsmen in prehistory, a millennium before the high point of the classical age in Athens in the Fifth Century BC.

Every decade has their supers, from impish, mini-skirted, swinging- 60s icons Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy to quirky Cara Delevingne today. But the phenomenon goes back further than Twiggy, to the very start of the 20th Century, when the world s first ever supermodel rose to fame. Evelyn Nesbit, a willowy, copper-haired beauty from Philadelphia, was the most sought-after artists  and fashion model in America s Gilded Age. Her life was turbulent and eventful, and her fame peaked when she became embroiled in a murder, and what was then dubbed  the trial of the century . Nesbit embodied her era in more ways than one. The late 19th Century was a glamorous period of rapid economic growth in the US but it was also an era of considerable poverty, as many poor European immigrants poured in. Nesbit in her lifetime saw both sides. She came from a modest Scots-Irish background in Tarentum, Pennsylvania, and after her father died leaving debts, her mother struggled to support the family. It was also an age with one foot still in the starchy Victorian era and one just about to step into the permissive Roaring  20s. The young Evelyn was from a  respectable  family, and modelled   fully dressed   for artists from the age of 14, as a way out of poverty for the whole family. When she came to New York in 1900, her rise was meteoric. But she was also stepping into a new, different world. James Carroll Beckwith, whose main patron was John Jacob Astor, took her under his wing, introduced her to artists and illustrators, and Nesbit was soon the most in-demand model in New York. She was the inspiration for numerous art works, including sculptor George Grey Barnard s famous piece Innocence (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Charles Dana Gibson s Women: The Eternal Question (1905). She was a popular face too on the illustrated covers of many journals and magazines, among them Vanity Fair, Harper s Bazaar, The Delineator and Ladies  Home Journal, and her likeness was also to be found advertising everything from face creams to toothpastes. In demand Nesbitt s soft-featured, youthful face soon became ubiquitous, to be seen on postcards, tobacco cards, calendars and chromolithographs. She often posed for illustrators in costume   a wood nymph, a gypsy, a Grecian goddess, a geisha girl   she was always clothed and the resulting images were not overtly sexual, though there was a pin-up suggestiveness about them that no doubt contributed to their popularity   and Nesbit s celebrity.",

        "title": "Who was the mysterious Madame X in Sargent s portrait?",
        "content": "John Singer Sargent s infamous portrait scandalised late-19th Century Paris. But who was the woman in the painting? Jason Farago investigates. She looks off to the right, staring out into the middle distance, her mouth shut tight, her dainty nose directed ever so slightly downward. Her right hand rests upon a bare wooden table, while her left hand, decorated with a wedding ring, clutches a folded fan. Her hair is twisted up, away from her shoulders   which are bare save for two straps, somewhat unconvincingly holding up her cinched, classical black gown. On her head is a little diamond tiara, but other than that and the ring she wears no jewelry. Between her long neck and the plunging, heart-shaped neckline of her dress lie acres of flesh, as cold and pale as ice milk. John Singer Sargent s portrait of the so-called  Madame X , painted in 1884 and now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, has attracted and repelled generations of gallery-goers. The stern face and the pseudonymous title have made her into a figure of mystery, an American Mona Lisa of inscrutable character. But her mystery, her anonymity, is not the result of lost historical documents or the covering of artistic footprints. Madame X, so alluring and so enigmatic, was once a bona fide celebrity   before it all came crashing down. John Singer Sargent s Portrait of Madame X caused a massive scandal upon its debut in Paris in 1884, in part because it emphasised the sexual allure of a married woman (Wikipedia) She was born Virginie Am lie Avegno, the daughter of white Creole parents in New Orleans. Her father died fighting for the Confederacy at the Battle of Shiloh in 1862. In 1866 her young brother died too, of congestive fever. Her widowed mother had had enough, and after taking out loans on the family plantation she left with her daughter to Paris in 1867. The City of Light must have seemed like a daydream after the devastation of the Civil War and the travails of Reconstruction that were just beginning. But Am lie had been brought to Paris for more than that. She was there to get married, big time   which she promptly did, to a banker more than twice her age, Pierre Gautreau. She was beguiling. Not conventionally pretty, she nevertheless cut a striking figure with her thin lips and extreme pallor; according to one Sargent biographer, she not only covered herself with powder, but also consumed arsenic to sap her skin of colour. (It was actually a less toxic substance .)  I remember seeing Madame de Gautrot [sic], the noted beauty of the day, and could not help stalking her as one does a deer,  wrote the American expatriate artist Edward Simmons.  Her head and neck undulated like that of a young doe . Every artist wanted to make her in marble or paint.  Yet though she had public admirers and a packet of money, she still struggled to climb to the top of Parisian society; the gossip pages took only limited notice of her, and as a Creole she would have been excluded from the highest echelons of the French beau monde. She, and her ambitious mother, were keen to make her name. And the young John Singer Sargent, who had commissions from fellow expats but craved French acceptance, was keen to make his. So there they were, the American society madam and the American painter, both in their late 20s, both eager for their big break. It took 30 sessions, and, as he would throughout his career, Sargent chose the dress: the little black number, which might actually be a two-piece skirt and bodice brutally drawn in at the waist, with severe d colletage. And   as a preparatory sketch in the Tate s collection shows   she originally appeared with one of the dress s straps missing. That bare shoulder, plus the wedding ring on her left hand, made a scandalous combination. It signified, not very subtly, that this married woman would look kindly on introductions from other men.",

        "content": "A historian claims Bach s wife wrote some of his works. That s up for debate, but these 10 female composers deserve recognition, Clemency Burton-Hill argues. Scandal threatened to rock the classical music world recently when a music historian named Professor Martin Jarvis reasserted his explosive theory that some of JS Bach s music was in fact written by his second wife, Anna Magdalena. His new documentary, Written By Mrs Bach, is described on its distributor s website as a  300 year old mystery and detective story , which incurs the  wrath of scholars worldwide  as it  challenges and confronts the myths surrounding Johann Sebastian Bach . Supported by  stunning visual forensic evidence , it claims that the handwriting in some of the original Bach manuscripts was not that of a mere transcriber or copyist, as we had previously understood Anna Magdalena to be, but bears the hallmarks of a mind in the act of creation. Over the years, plenty of minor works by JS Bach have been reattributed to others, with little furore. So why is this causing such a stir? Not only are the pieces in question some of Bach s greatest   including some of the Cello Suites and Well-Tempered Clavier   but the suggestion they might have been written by a woman rather than another man is raising the musical patriarchy s collective hackles. How could Anna Magdalena have written such sublime things, given she had over a dozen children to attend to, not to mention domestic duties galore? As critic Ivan Hewett notes, Bach s wife would also  have had to defy one of the strongest prejudices of her era , namely that  Woman, a lesser sort of being made from Adam s spare rib, couldn t possibly be creative. She could sing and play music, but only men could do the serious intellectual business of writing the stuff.  If Professor Jarvis  thesis turns out to be true, Hewett muses, it  puts a bomb right at the heart of the old patriarchal view of the Western tradition . Ever since Hildegard von Bingen in the 12th Century, women   as in other art forms   have made a significant contribution to classical music which has often been overlooked. This is not just a great injustice on an individual level to those creative and brilliant humans, but a shame for music history in general. Whether Anna Magdalena was the  real  Bach behind some of that glorious music or not, let s hope Professor Jarvis  arguments can inspire and empower classical-music-inclined females to slip out from their male counterparts  shadows. Because goodness knows we in classical music need our Beyonc s and our Taylor Swifts more than ever. Here are 10 undersung female composers who should be recognised for their contributions to the classical canon. 1. Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179)",

Christian Petzold s Phoenix is one of the latest German films to address the war and its aftermath, and it was a sensation at the Toronto Film Festival. It stars Hoss as a Jewish woman who survived imprisonment in a concentration camp and searches the rubble of post-war Berlin for her husband, who may have betrayed her to the Nazis.

At a time of decline in religious faith and amid an industrial revolution that changed landscapes and cities forever, artists in the Low Countries began to look inwards, turning art into a new kind of religion. The most famous artist to come out of the Netherlands and Belgium in the 19th Century, Vincent van Gogh s biography is well-known: the tortured man who cut off his ear in despair; the troubled soul who found ecstasy in the beauty of the French landscape. After unsucessfully attempting a career in the church, Van Gogh discovered his true calling in painting:  I ve found my work  he wrote in an early letter,  something which I live for heart and soul.  Andrew Graham-Dixon explains how the painter transformed everyday images of nature into visions of divine beauty, reaching a climax in his most famous subject: sunflowers.

Since avant-garde musicians in the 1950s first experimented with tape recorders, editing together sound fragments in a style called  musique concr te , messages have been inserted into songs that only become clear once they are played backwards.

Influenced by the techniques of musique concr te, they featured a backmasked line in Rain, a single released in 1966. Featuring in the fade-out, the reversed vocal is the first line of the song.  On the end of Rain you hear me singing it backwards,  John Lennon told Rolling Stone magazine in 1968.  We'd done the main thing at EMI and the habit was then to take the songs home and see what you thought a little extra gimmick or what the guitar piece would be. So I got home about five in the morning, stoned out of my head, I staggered up to my tape recorder and I put it on, but it came out backwards, and I was in a trance in the earphones, what is it   what is it?

Once life became more than chasing beasts, running away from bigger beasts, occasional mating and surviving ice ages, things got complicated. Once your life became a little more secure, you had to work out how to live your life. And so, philosophers. Socrates was facing execution when he laid down the challenge to succeeding generations and urged his fellow Athenians to pay more attention to the upkeep of their own souls (it s where we get the word psychotherapy). Since then, as knowledge has vastly expanded, living  the good life  has become an idea scrutinised by sects, cults, gurus and self-proclaimed self-help messiahs. Do the right thing One group, named after the street on which they hung around preaching, came to be known as the Stoics. Their founder, Zeno, suggested that our emotions are shaped by our thoughts, our feelings by our opinions, that we had free will, that we can change and that the key to a good life was to be virtuous and to think in harmony with nature. What chimes with a lot of modern self-help is that attaining happiness is an active endeavour. Happiness can only come through thinking about what the right thing to do is and then acting on that.

The periscope broke through the water. The U-boat captain had to be quick: he had just a few seconds to find his target and fire. And then the ship he was tracking appeared to break up, jolt, change direction. The torpedo missed. That was the idea, anyway. The scientist John Graham Kerr first suggested the use of camouflage to make it difficult to calculate a ship s course in 1914, but it was an artist who developed the technique. British marine painter and poster artist Norman Wilkinson was inspired to create  dazzle  camouflage after serving as a Royal Navy volunteer in a submarine patrol at Gallipoli and on a minesweeping ship off the British coast. Instead of attempting to render warships invisible, he aimed to confuse the enemy with contrasting colours and shapes that distorted the ship s form and obscured its movement in the water. The troopship USS Leviathan, 1918. (Hirz/Frederic Lewis/Archive Photos/Getty Images) Now the optical illusions have been revived as part of a series of art commissions celebrating the centenary of World War I. Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez has created a new work for a historic pilot ship in Liverpool, and in London today, Tobias Rehberger unveiled his transformation of the HMS President, which served as a  dazzle ship  during the conflict. The German sculptor won the Golden Lion award at the 53rd International Venice Biennale with a cafe he created using the principles of dazzle painting. Although Wilkinson s own artwork was traditional   he was commissioned to create paintings for the smoking rooms on the Titanic   his dazzle designs have been compared to the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Curves on the hull of a ship could create the impression of a wave, shapes on smokestacks suggested the ship was facing another direction, and patterns at bow and stern made it hard to see which was which.",

For the technically or mathematically minded, a geodesic dome is a spherical structure composed of triangular elements forming part of a network of circles, or  geodesics , on the surface of a given sphere. This description might seem a little mind-bending, yet for New Age Americans in the 1960s and  70s, the geodesic dome, for all its formal complexity, represented freedom, the potential to create a wholly new form of lightweight structure that, theoretically, could be placed anywhere within the United States. The idea of a home that could be manufactured in a factory and flown by helicopter to any suitable plot of land had long been a dream of the US inventor Richard Buckminster Fuller. Born in 1895, Fuller was a more or less a practical dreamer. Expelled twice from Harvard, he took on such unlikely jobs as a labourer in a stockyard and commander of a crash rescue boat in World War I before finding funds   through persuasion and charm   to develop a number of prototypes for factory made homes. He called these radical devices Dymaxion houses. Fuller believed they would sell like Model-T Fords, but they never quite caught on. Fuller even developed a Dymaxion car that was like no other that has been seen on US roads or anywhere else since. The British architect Norman Foster has recently had a replica built of this enormous, three-wheel, streamlined Buck Rogers-style car. Originally, only three were built.",

        "content": "The invention of the elevator enabled a whole new type of architecture   and had a profound effect on our culture, writes Jonathan Glancey. Scary stories about elevators are a dime a dozen: lurid tales about lifts are ten a penny. Lifts and elevators are, of course, one and the same thing, yet whatever you choose to call them, they have long evoked fears of being trapped inside or of plunging to death down dark, vertiginous shafts. A gift to filmmakers, the elevator was as its nastiest in De Lift, a 1983 Dutch shocker directed by Dick Maas in which an elevator fitted with a bio-computer brain finds nasty ways to kill those unwittingly foolish enough to ride it. As an antidote, watch Alfred Hitchcock s North by Northwest. In one scene of this immeasurably stylish 1959 thriller, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), an advertising executive mistaken for a spy rides a busy hotel lift along with his mother, hotel guests and a pair of murderous bad guys. The tension is broken when mother says, ever so politely,  You gentlemen aren t really trying to kill my son, are you?  Cue polite and then increasingly hysterical laughter from those crowded in to the lift including the thwarted gunmen   as Grant stares grimly ahead. The famous moment from North by Northwest when Roger Thornhill s mother single-handedly foils a plot to kill her son in a hotel lift (MGM) Lifts have engendered such heightened fears and emotions ever since Elisha Graves Otis demonstrated his elevator safety brake at the New York Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations in 1853. Standing on a high platform, this showman-inventor ordered the rope holding him up severed with an axe. Almost before the crowd below had time to gasp, the lift would grind to a sudden halt. Repeated many times, this theatrical demonstration convinced the world that lifts were safe. They had existed for at least 2000 years   Vitruvius, the first century Roman architect, noted a design for one by Archimedes dating from around 235BC   but Otis proved they were safe for everyday use.",

        "title": "9/11 Memorial Museum: How to remember?",
        "content": "What is striking, though, is the limited nature of the museum s mission. Early visitors have described the wrenching experience of its permanent collection galleries as if they were reliving that awful day, but there is little about the causes of 9/11, except for a short film that has been widely criticized as Islamophobic.. Holland Cotter, the New York Times s co-chief art critic, noted that the museum s depiction of 9/11 is  not so much wrong as drastically incomplete,  offering  news, not analysis.  And, if it remains so, the museum might not have the importance for future generations that it does for ours. A steel beam from the original World Trade Center stands at the center of the Foundation Hall of the museum (Getty Images) Very few museums focus with such single-mindedness on one disaster or one historical crime: Holocaust museums, say, or the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. Even battlefield sites, such as the Gettysburg Museum in Pennsylvania, regularly take in larger remits than the single event that happened at the site. That s for good reason. Museums do best when they not only narrate history, but place it in context and set it in motion. The Smithsonian, for example, does not recount the history of slavery in a standalone institution; slavery is right in the middle of the National Museum of American History. And that s as it should be   the history of the United States is inseparable from the history of slavery, and to separate the part from the whole would diminish both. In context With an event as traumatic as 9/11, whose history is still being written and whose victims are still among us, a more capacious view might be difficult. (And there is some history here. In 2005, George Pataki   the former New York governor and the great villain of the World Trade Center s reconstruction, who also overruled his own jury s recommendations for the site s design   evicted a planned historical museum from the 9/11 museum s site, which conservatives bashed as a  blame America monument. ) But even the greatest traumas, with the greatest need for respect and remembrance, offer room for context. One excellent case study is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Even while the museum insists on the uniqueness and irreducibility of the Holocaust, it also looks more broadly at anti-Semitism and discrimination, as well as at other genocides and war crimes, some dismayingly recent. The museum s permanent exhibition, with its searing display of thousands of victims  shoes, has lost none of its force in the decades since it opened. But it has also presented exhibitions related to Bosnia, Darfur, and most impressively Rwanda   a genocide with horrible parallels to the Holocaust, and which the museum has researched in depth since 1994. Last month, museum officials traveled to Kigali for the 20th anniversary commemorations of the Rwandan genocide; accompanying them was Margit Meissner, a Holocaust survivor. Alice Greenwald, the director of the 9/11 museum, is a veteran of Washington s Holocaust museum. Having steered the new institution to this week s opening, I hope that she thinks about the successes of her previous one, and begins to imagine ways in which the atrocious events of 9/11 could be placed in their historical epoch, rather than shown as an event wrenched out of time. Maybe the political risks are too formidable, and maybe it s too soon: Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, who has admitted to planning the 9/11 attacks, is still being held at Guant namo Bay, where his trial is once again delayed. But in a few years, perhaps, the museum may be ready to look beyond the few hours of that Tuesday in September and take into its narrative all the stories that came before and since: the attacks in Madrid and London and Bali, the ongoing revelations about government surveillance, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. That would be the best way to ensure that 9/11 retains its relevance when the millions of us who lived through it are gone, and it is left to New Yorkers born after 2001 to educate the living and commemorate the dead.",
        "target_summary": "The 9/11 museum is criticized for its limited mission, focusing narrowly on the event itself without adequate context, causes, or analysis. Unlike other successful museums, such as the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, which place events in a broader historical framework, the 9/11 museum offers \"news, not analysis.\" The text suggests that expanding its narrative to include the historical epoch and related events is crucial for its long-term relevance to future generations.",

        "content": "The truth is that despite frenzied speculation (was she the artist s daughter, or perhaps his mistress?), we will probably never know the identity of the model for Vermeer s Girl   if there even was one. Vermeer, himself, is a shadowy figure in the history of art. Once nicknamed  the sphinx of Delft , his native town which he never left, he produced little   only around three dozen paintings are today agreed to be by him. He also left behind few biographical traces, though we do know that his wife bore him 15 children. He is recognised as a master of light who specialised in painting women in sparse domestic interiors, and his pictures are prized in part because they are often suffused with mystery. Unlike some of his Dutch contemporaries, who crammed their compositions full of material objects and narrative detail, Vermeer got a kick out of teasing the viewer and withholding meaning. In one of his canvases, for instance, an elegant couple is engaged in a music lesson   but is the gentleman her tutor, a suitor, or her lover? We will never know. As for his Girl, well, she is even more perplexing. As Emilie Gordenker, the director of the Mauritshuis, told me recently, 17th-Century viewers would have looked at Vermeer s painting and seen not a portrait but a type of picture known as a  tronie .  A  tronie  is a study of a head and shoulders dressed in exotic clothing,  she explains. The giveaway is the turban: it lends an oriental flavour to the canvas, transporting viewers to a faraway realm of the imagination.  While it is possible that someone modelled for it,  Gordenker says,  just as Rubens often painted figures who looked like his wife, it isn t meant to be a specific person, but someone more generalised, timeless and mysterious   perhaps a sibyl or a figure from the Bible.  Moreover, according to one theory, the impossible pearl, which is too big to be worn in reality, was meant to be understood as a piece of costume jewellery   so adding to the general atmosphere of artifice and make-believe. For Gordenker, this  sense of mystery  is what attracts people to the Girl.  Partly, she s just gorgeous   that s easy,  she says.  But the composition is also very clever. Out of that dark background, she pops into our space looking very much alive   and the gesture is a big part of that. Her mouth is open, which you don t see that much in Dutch paintings, so she seems as if she is about to talk to you. I m dying to know what she s going to say. And around the world   in Japan, in the United States, in Italy   everybody has the same reaction: you can see them trying to fill in the story.   The image works because it is unresolved,  agrees Tracy Chevalier, whose novel about the painting has sold more than three million copies.  You can t ever answer the question of what she s thinking or how she s feeling. If it were resolved, then you d move onto the next painting. But it isn t, so you turn back to it again and again, trying to unlock that mystery. That s what all masterpieces do: we long to understand them, but we never will.  Lost and found The curious thing, though, is that it hasn t always been this way. A hundred years ago, visitors to the Mauritshuis were more eager to see Paulus Potter s gargantuan canvas The Bull (1647), which, with its massive, mud-spattered bovine protagonist, was prized as the last word in Dutch naturalism. Back then Vermeer s Girl was more wallflower than superstar.",

        "content": "Verdi s operas are well known   but what about his work as a member of parliament and fervent supporter of Italian unification? On the eve of the composer s 200th anniversary, Clemency Burton-Hill looks back at Verdi s life and times. Can you imagine any country today in national mourning over the death of a classical composer? When Giuseppe Verdi, born 200 years ago next week, died in January 1901, Italy wept as one. Almost a quarter of a million people took to the streets, marching to Va, Pensiero from Nabucco   better known as the Chorus of Hebrew Slaves   sung by a massed choir under the baton of celebrated maestro Arturo Toscanini. Verdi was a truly great composer: there is no question about it. Along with an eternal Requiem, some ravishing sacred choral music and a few notable chamber and orchestral works, there are of course the thirty-odd operas, at least twenty of which are in the core operatic canon. More than any year in recent memory, 2013 has seen a succession of major composers  anniversaries   Benjamin Britten s centenary, the bicentenary of Richard Wagner s birth, the four-hundredth anniversary of Gesualdo s grisly death   and it is noticeable that, in comparison to the festivities arranged for these other dates, the Verdi bicentenary has scarcely made an impact. This is not an indication of the esteem in which he is held; it merely reflects the fact that his music is performed all the time anyway, all over the world. It s a pretty safe bet that, on any given night, someone somewhere will be singing Rigoletto or Otello, Aida or Violetta. But the reason the Italians took to the streets that wintry day at the dawn of the last century was about much more than just music. Verdi s operas had provided the soundtrack to the politically tempestuous half-century that preceded his death, and his most famous arias had become quasi-anthems for a nation recently unified. When Nabucco had its premiere at La Scala in 1842,  Italy  was simply a cluster of geographically contiguous kingdoms and principalities with little more to unite them than a common language. So when Italians sang the Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves at Verdi s funeral procession, it wasn t just because it was a catchy tune they knew the words to. Its subject   the Israelites giving poignant voice to their longing for the promised land   had become a powerful analogue for the long-frustrated desires of the Italian people. When they cried  Viva Verdi!  during the funeral procession, they were still acutely conscious of the slogan s double meaning and its clandestine resonance for the agitators of  the Risorgimento , as the cause of Italian nationalism was known. The letters VERDI also spelled out the name of the King of Sardinia who, in 1861, finally took the throne of a unified nation for the first time since the 6th Century   Victor Emmanuele Re D Italia. That same year, at the request of the new Prime Minister Camillo Cavour, Verdi entered the country s very first parliament, in which he served for four years. Call me uncharitable, but I suspect the likes of Silvio Berlusconi (or Enrico Letta, or Mario Monti) would be hard pressed to name a contemporary classical composer, let alone invite them into the big tent of government.  Honour those heroes!",

        "content": "Alastair Sooke looks through the ultimate Renaissance man s anatomical sketchbooks   scientific masterpieces full of lucid insights into the functioning of the human body. We tend to think of Leonardo da Vinci as a painter, even though he probably produced no more than 20 pictures before his death in 1519. Yet for long periods of his career, which lasted for nearly half a century, he was engrossed in all sorts of surprising pursuits, from stargazing and designing ingenious weaponry to overseeing a complex system of canals for Ludovico Maria Sforza, the ruling duke of Milan. During the course of his life, Leonardo filled thousands of pages of manuscript with dense doodles, diagrams, and swirling text, probing almost every conceivable topic. Not for nothing, then, is he often considered the archetypal Renaissance man: as the great British art historian Kenneth Clark put it, Leonardo was the most relentlessly curious person in history. Yet according to Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Man, a new exhibition at the Edinburgh International Festival, one area of scientific endeavour piqued Leonardo s curiosity arguably more than any other: human anatomy. Leonardo s interest in anatomy began when he was working for Ludovico in Milan.  On the 2nd day of April 1489 , as he wrote at the head of a page in a new notebook, he sat down to begin his  Book entitled On the Human Figure . After executing a sequence of stunning drawings of a skull, though, his studies went into abeyance, probably because he lacked access to corpses that he could dissect. Bodies of evidence But his ambitions to publish a comprehensive treatise on human anatomy persisted   and around two decades later, he returned to his otherwise unused notebook, which is now known as the Anatomical Manuscript B and is kept at the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. In it he made a number of pen-and-ink drawings recording his observations while dissecting an old man who had died in a hospital in Florence in the winter of 1507-08. In the years that followed, Leonardo concentrated on human anatomy more systematically than ever before   and by the end of his life he claimed that he had cut up more than 30 corpses. In the winter of 1510-11, while probably collaborating with a young professor of anatomy called Marcantonio della Torre at the University of Pavia, Leonardo compiled a series of 18 mostly double-sided sheets exploding with more than 240 individual drawings and over 13,000 words of notes. Now known as the Anatomical Manuscript A, and also in the Royal Collection, these sheets are full of lucid insights into the functioning anatomy of the human body.",

        "content": "Fifty years ago, Martin Luther King s speech defined America s civil rights struggle. And it was a song by soul singer Mahalia Jackson that stole the show. Mahalia Jackson took America to church 50 years ago. Minutes before her friend Martin Luther King Jr. announced  I have a dream  to cap the March on Washington DC on 28 August 1963, Sister Mahalia reminded the 250,000 citizens spread out in front of the Lincoln Memorial of the long road they had travelled.  You know my soul looks back in wonder, how I got over,  she sang, praising the heavens for allowing her people to make it this far. But their struggle was far from over. A Hammond organ simmered, and rhythmic handclapping broke out as the singer closed her eyes and rhapsodised. In the past, the gospel classic How I Got Over had allowed her to cut loose for 10, even 15 minutes at a time as she worked church aisles and reached into the pews to grasp hands and anoint foreheads. She had recorded several versions of the song, but they were relatively tame compared to the heights she could reach in front of a congregation. Now, in the minutes before King was to speak, it was once again Holy Ghost time   the type of performance where Jackson surrendered not just her voice but her body to the moment, bending and twisting her robust frame as she reached for the notes. The legendary singer would be the final musical performer on a day in which the civil rights movement mingled with folk music and gospel in front of a national audience   not just the quarter-million assembled to hear King speak about job equality and voting rights, but millions more watching on television and listening on the radio. Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Odetta, the Freedom Singers and Marian Anderson also had performed, but it was Jackson who seized the day with a song that had particularly deep resonance in the African-American community. Pioneer of protest There is some dispute about the exact origins of How I Got Over. Reverend William Herbert Brewster is often credited with writing the song, though it was reinterpreted and popularized by Clara Ward and her family gospel group, the Famous Ward Sisters. In a memoir written by Ward s sister, Willa, she claims the song was inspired by a racial incident in Georgia during the early  50s while the family was travelling between performances. The Wards rode in a Cadillac, which drew unwanted attention from a group of whites, who blocked the road and viciously taunted the passengers. Only a feigned speaking-in-tongues seizure by the family matriarch, Gertrude Ward, prevented the incident from turning even uglier, and possibly deadly, Willa wrote in How I Got Over: Clara Ward and the World-Famous Ward Singers. The whites scattered when they saw Gertrude writhing, shaking and babbling.",

        "content": "An idea that came from Hitler would become the best-selling car of all time. Jonathan Glancey explains our enduring love for the Volkswagen Beetle. In 1945, a rare and curious Volkswagen car was shipped from its bomb-damaged German factory to England. Here, a commission of leading British motor manufacturers, chaired by Sir William Rootes, inspected the small, streamlined saloon. It would be  quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer , the commission reported.  It is too ugly and noisy , while  to build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.  This damning judgement proved as ill founded as that of Decca record bosses who, in 1962, declared  The Beatles have no future in show business , and turned the mop-tops down. Since then, global sales of highly lucrative Beatles  albums have topped two billion. The Volkswagen Beetle, meanwhile, with its friendly styling by the Austrian designer Erwin Komenda, and innovative engineering by Ferdinand Porsche, became the best-selling car of all time. Production of the Beetle outstripped that of Henry Ford s Model-T when the 15,007,034th car rolled off the line at Wolfsburg in 1972. The very last Beetles were made in Mexico in 2003 by when more than 21.5 million had been built worldwide. As its name made clear, the Volkswagen was truly a  People s Car , and, although many modifications were made between 1945 and 2003, the first and last Beetles were clearly peas in the the same mechanical pod. Star vehicle The remarkable thing about the Beetle is not just the sheer number of sales, but the fact that a car developed from an idea of Adolf Hitler s was to become as loved by Californian surf dudes, college kids and free lovin  hippies as it was desired by fervent Nazis. Herbie   the anthropomorphic star of six Hollywood movies beginning with The Love Bug in 1968   was the same car German families had saved up for before Hitler s invasion of Poland dashed their hopes. Ultimately, the sheer quality, along with the affordability, reliability, economy and distinct look and feel of the Beetle, ensured its success. It had, though, been touch and go for Volkswagen in 1945. Although the car had been on the drawing board since 1934, following a meeting between Hitler and Porsche, the Volkswagen failed to get into production before the war.",

But it is for his glorious music, not his grisly crimes, that we should remember Carlo Gesualdo, writes Clemency Burton-Hill.  Irrefutably badass  is not the obvious phrase to reach for when discussing a late-Renaissance lutenist and composer whose output was chiefly a capella madrigals and settings of sacred texts. But it is how Alex Ross, the esteemed critic of The New Yorker describes Don Carlo Gesualdo, who died 400 years ago this week   and badass Gesualdo indisputably was, both as a musician and as a man. A figure of fascination over the years for artists as diverse as Igor Stravinsky, Aldous Huxley, Bernardo Bertolucci and Werner Herzog, the continuing fixation on Gesualdo four centuries after his death is not surprising when you consider the grisly and gruesome details of his biography. We tend to think of classical music as a rather staid affair; its practitioners generally well-behaved servants at court who busy themselves with counterpoint and harmony, not murder and sadism. Gesualdo, on the other hand, lived a life   and death   that the most luridly resourceful director of slasher B-movies might struggle to dream up. A prince and nobleman from a prominent aristocratic family in the Kingdom of Naples, at 20 Gesualdo married his 24-year-old first cousin, the legendarily alluring Maria d Avalos, who already had two marriages behind her. Both husbands are said to have expired  in excess of connubial bliss . One fateful night in October 1590, Gesualdo discovered her in flagrante with the Duke of Andria, Don Fabrizio Carafa (he was wearing Maria s silk nightgown at the time). Gesualdo immediately set about slaughtering the pair, slashing their limbs with his sword, mutilating their sexual organs, and puncturing their skulls with the bullets of his gun. He then allegedly murdered the baby boy who may or may not have been his or Don Fabrizio s child by swinging him to death in his castle courtyard. Immune from the law by dint of his noble status, things didn t look up much for the prince after that: married again, he became subject to fits of depression that could only be relieved by regular beatings from a group of young boys kept at his castle for this express purpose. Embroiled in both the Spanish Inquisition and a witchcraft trial (he was supposedly tormented by the spells and potions of his rejected former concubine), Gesualdo ended his days in a depressive tumult and is said to have been beaten to death, aged 47, by his servants in some kind of masochistic rampage.

        "content": "But why would the studio heads, most of whom were Jewish, so willingly agree to shape their movies to please Nazi sensibilities? Urwand suggests it was all about maintaining access to the German market. Urwand s critics claim he has got it wrong   that the German market wasn t consistently lucrative in the 1930s. On this point, Urwand concedes that box office revenues really started to dwindle by about 1936   and that in 1937 one US studio sustained a loss in Germany. But he maintains Hollywood was thinking in the long term   it wanted to maintain a business relationship to ensure it had access to markets in Germany and other European countries that Hitler might conquer should the Third Reich prevail. Some of Urwand s detractors also maintain he has overplayed the role and influence of the German consul in Hollywood. Steven J Ross, Professor of History at USC, who is working on a book called Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews and their Spies Foiled Nazi and Fascist Plots Against America, argues that it wasn t George Gyslling who had the power but local American officials enforcing the Motion Picture Production Code. The Production Code was a set of self-imposed guidelines that Hollywood adopted. Its stipulations governed how filmmakers could cover a wide range of subjects   everything from sex, drugs and murder to the depiction of American flag. Ross notes that it also  prohibited any studio from making a film that denigrated any foreign country or leader. So that meant that most of the efforts to produce anti-fascist films didn t get produced not because of Gyssling but because of the Production Code censors simply refusing to allow it to be made because it violated the code.  Also, it s argued that there are other reasons why the studio heads didn t fight more strongly to make films with anti-fascist themes   or for the inclusion of Jewish characters in their movies. Film critic David Denby says that  the studio bosses were all from Eastern Europe. They never lost their feeling that as outsiders and as Jews, it could all be taken away.  Consequently they may have been hesitant, in an anti-Semitic environment, of taking any action which could be construed as being favourable to Jewish interests. LA influential",

        "content": "Fifty years since the Rolling Stones released their first single, Greg Kot asks whether the band s music has suffered from comparison with The Beatles. By the time the Rolling Stones got around to making records in 1963, The Beatles had already been cutting tracks with George Martin at Abbey Road studios for nearly a year. The Beatles were already stars, and their sweep made what the Stones did (and every other band in the UK, for that matter) seem like a response. In the end, of course, the Stones got their due as rock s nastiest band   that is, until Johnny Rotten came along. Since then, history has pretty much confined the two legendary groups to their prescribed roles: The Beatles as innovators and universal pop icons, the Stones as the anti-Beatles, the dirtiest Chicago blues band not from Chicago. Myth becomes fact. Or does it? It s hard to imagine that a band currently charging as much as $600 for their North American concert tour could once have been underrated. But the Stones  musical contributions often get short shrift because of the huge shadow cast by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and, yes, even Ringo Starr. On the occasion of the 50-year anniversary of the Rolling Stones  first single   a cover of Chuck Berry s Come On, released in June 1963   it s time to reassess. Were the Stones as revolutionary as the Beatles? No, but their reign of good-to-great albums was nearly twice as long, and their best music from this era   1963 through 1981   has a consistency, durability and variety that few bands from any era could match. Not even The Beatles, it turns out. The Beatles were running on fumes during the Let it Be sessions in 1969 and broke up soon after piecing together their final masterpiece, Abbey Road. The Stones were already playing it prickly on their first single. Come On was loosely modelled on Berry s original, recorded in 1960 at Chess Records studio in Chicago, but it had nothing of the guitarist s bounce and brightness. Berry raced through the lyrics with breathless anxiety, but the Stones played it rough and sullen as Mick Jagger sneered his way through the obstacles life dared to throw at him. The track rippled onto the pop charts. A few months later the Stones would have an even bigger hit with another cover, I Wanna Be Your Man, written by two guys named Lennon and McCartney, who were already so popular in the UK that they could hand leftovers to their rivals and watch them turn into gold. The British invasion The Beatles invaded and seduced America, with their three-night run on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964. For the next six years they were the biggest rock band in the world. The Stones followed The Beatles overseas a few months later, but were smugly mocked by Dean Martin on a less popular TV variety show, Hollywood Palace.",

Historically, The Beatles were seen as innovators and the Stones as their \"anti-Beatles\" counterpart due to the former's head start in recording and fame. The article posits that while not as revolutionary, the Stones' period of \"good-to-great\" albums (1963-1981) was nearly twice as long as The Beatles' and demonstrated superior consistency and durability.",

        "content": "To celebrate 100 years since the composer s birth, Clemency Burton-Hill recommends the best way for a casual listener to discover the magic of Britten s music. 2013 has brought forth an embarrassment of riches when it comes to musical anniversaries. As well as the bicentenaries of Wagner and Verdi, the year marks four centuries since the musical visionary and murderer Gesualdo died and one since the marvel that is Benjamin Britten was born. Britten s musical language is singular and can be tough going, and his sound world can be as disconcerting and strange as it is ravishing. Where in Britten s output might a casual listener begin? For me, the master keys that unlocked Britten s universe were his Canticles. A listen to the complete cycle will take less than a single hour of your life but resonate far beyond. Composed between 1947 and 1974, they bookend Britten s post-war career and form a unique strand in his oeuvre.  They are song, opera, cantata and chamber music , says the tenor Ben Johnson, a rising British (and Britten) star, whose critically-acclaimed new recording of the Canticles is out now on Signum Classics.  And so they correspond with the most delicate of intimacy and the most effective of grand gesture . There can be  no greater summary , he reckons, of Britten s work. Like a prayer Suffused with spirituality if not overtly liturgical ( canticle , loosely defined, denotes a short prayer-like song), they are five precise distillations of Britten s art: gem-like compressions of his supreme talents as a dramatist of human emotion. Musically spare and occasionally subversive, the Canticles shimmer with dissonance and drama, love and chaos. They seethe, they teem, they shatter. They are not, Johnson cautions,  easy listening . But much of the engagement and the wonder   especially for a bookish listener   comes from Britten s ability to set text with such mastery. As a new exhibition at the British Library explores, Britten always had a splendidly literary intelligence, writing operas based on Thomas Mann (Death in Venice), Shakespeare (A Midsummer Night s Dream), Henry James (The Turn of the Screw) and Herman Melville (Billy Budd). The words of the Canticles drink wide and deep across English literature, from the Bible to 17th-Century metaphysical poetry; from medieval Chester Miracle Plays to Edith Sitwell, whose Still Falls The Rain is the basis for the mournful Canticle III   composed in memory of the young pianist Noel Mewton-Wood, who had recently killed himself.",

        "content": "It is no longer the world s tallest building, but the Empire State Building s charisma ensures it remains an icon of American design.  Look! There s the Empire State Building!  First-time visitors to New York have been pointing excitedly to the pencil thin profile of the Empire State Building for more than eighty years. Lit up by night in coats of many electric colours celebrating high days and holidays, its spire sometimes vanishing into low cloud, at others crackling with lightning, this commanding and supremely elegant skyscraper is, beyond doubt, one of the world s most revered buildings. In some ways this is surprising. To bring the 1,454-ft (443 m) skyscraper down to earth, the Empire State Building is nothing more than an office block, and for several decades many of its 102 floors were rather shabby. It got off to a less than auspicious start. Declared open by President Herbert Hoover on 1 May 1931, the  tallest building in the world  was hit by the Great Depression. A year on, just a quarter of its floors had been occupied; and it took until 1950 before what New Yorkers dubbed the  Empty State Building  turned a profit. Worse still, on 28 July 1945 a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber flying through fog smashed into the offices of the National Catholic Welfare Council housed on the 79th and 80th floors, killing fourteen people. Today, the Empire State Building   home to some 1,000 businesses   is profitable and, enjoying a major renovation, becoming cleaner and  greener  than it has ever been. Clad in Indiana limestone, this slim steel-framed 20th Century ziggurat rockets up from the site of the old Waldorf Astoria Hotel. This was bought by a consortium led by John J Raskob, a high-rolling New York financier   a papal knight and father of thirteen children   who worked for General Motors. In 1929, GM s principal rival, Chrysler, had just put the finishing touches to the svelte 1,046-ft (319m) Art Deco skyscraper that bore its name in central Manhattan. Empire building Through Raskob s towering ambition, GM would go one better than Walter Chrysler. Raskob is said to have asked his architect, Brooklyn-born William Lamb of Shreve Lamb and Harmon,  Bill, how high can you make it so it won t fall down?  The answer was, of course, higher than the Chrysler Building. Drawing on the design of his earlier 314-ft (96m) Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Lamb prepared his design drawings in a fortnight.",

As the author, Erik Kirschbaum, tells the BBC:  Three-hundred-thousand East Germans were there   young, enthusiastic East Germans who had never had the chance to see a big Western rock star like that. Chimes of freedom?  Springsteen played an amazing concert   four hours long. It went straight to their hearts.  But what added the political impetus was that in the middle of it, Springsteen defied the authorities and gave a speech no more than a paragraph long. He spoke in German, which he had written out phonetically:  I am not for or against a government. I ve come to play rock and roll for you, in the hope that one day all barriers will be torn down.  He was greeted with a roar of approval. The moment he had spoken, he took off into Chimes of Freedom:  Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake/ Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsaked/ Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake/ An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing . The concert was transmitted with a time delay on East German television and radio channels and the short but utterly powerful speech never made it to air   but those in the concert knew exactly what  barriers  meant, and their word of mouth later travelled the nation. Of course, those words did not cause the collapse of communism. If they had not been spoken, East Germany s communist regime would still have crashed. The forces of change were too strong. But those forces didn t move on their own. Some factors pushed them further and some held them back. Some fanned the flame   and Springsteen gets credit for that, according to Erik Kirschbaum:  They had never heard a message like that. Here was this big, famous American rock star who came into the middle of East Germany, into East Berlin, and told them he hoped that the wall would come down one day.",

        "content": "A groundbreaking vision and a controversial construction colour the fascinating history of one of the world s most iconic buildings, writes Jonathan Glancey.  It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.  With this ringing endorsement from Unesco in 2007, the Sydney Opera House was declared a World Heritage Site. The famous building, with its soaring, sail-like roofs, that is often said to define the city, country and continent, was promoted to join ranks with the Egyptian pyramids, the Great Wall of China and the cathedrals of Chartres and Durham. This must have been a deeply moving moment for Jorn Utzon (1918-2008), the brilliant and poetic architect of the Sydney Opera House. From now on, there could be no doubting the supremely special qualities of this astonishing yet once hugely controversial building, opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1973. Today, few of the 1.2 million people who buy tickets for performances each year, and many fewer perhaps of the seven million who come to Sydney s Bennelong Point from around the world to gawp at this architectural marvel, would ever think that its visionary architect was once treated like a pariah by the government that commissioned the building. The story is as dismal, and as necessary to recall, as the opera house is glorious. It had all begun happily enough when, in 1957, Utzon s proposal was chosen from the 233 entries in an international competition held by the government of New South Wales for the design of an opera house on the site of a tram depot fronting Sydney Harbour. The judges kept returning to the young Danish architect s thrilling drawings even after they had discarded them several times in favour of more obviously practical designs. Intuition won the day.  We are convinced , said the judges at last,  that they [Utzon s drawings] present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.  Out of touch Construction began in 1957 with the driving of 588 concrete piles into land in and around Sydney Harbour to support the huge new building. But, as delays increased and costs began to spiral, a new coalition conservative government voted into office in 1965, took Utzon to task. Like Gaudi   the architect of Barcelona s Sagrada Familia   before him, Utzon believed that the design of a building on this scale should evolve over time. Davis Hughes, the new minister of public works, representing a government that was not exactly culturally aware, demanded instant solutions including a full set of working drawings of the interiors to speed construction along.",
