He swore an oath by the sun god Amun-Re, saying:  My Majesty will march by this Aruna Road!  He also determined that he himself would lead the army through the narrow pass.  None shall march on this road in front of my Majesty and (when the time came) he himself did march at the head of his army, showing the way with his own steps.  The route he chose was just over eight miles long, with parts of it only 30 feet wide. With steep walls on either side, it was the perfect place for the enemy to ambush an advancing army from above, as there was no room for maneuver. However, assuming the Egyptians would never risk such reckless exposure, the enemy had only stationed soldiers on the other two paths. Thutmose s army was able to march the route through the Aruna pass in one day without any problem. The soldiers emerged into the Qina valley to the astonishment of enemy troops who were encamped near the city of Megiddo. (The last missing tomb from this wealthy Egyptian dynasty has been found) The Egyptian advance At dawn the following day the Egyptian army was mobilized, dividing and deploying in three large units that advanced in crescent formation toward an encampment of Asian forces to the south of Megiddo. The inscription at Karnak records that:  The southern wing of his Majesty s army was at a hill south of the Qina [brook], and the northern wing to the northwest of Megiddo, while his Majesty was in their center, [Amun] protecting his person (in) the tumult, and the strength of [Seth pervading] his limbs.

SCALA, FLORENCE MILITARY OFFICIALS of ancient Egypt who won fame and fortune could expect a lavish tomb. The achievements of Thutmose III s commander Amenemheb (nicknamed Mahu) are partially preserved on a wall of his tomb. They record that he fought in many Asian campaigns, killing and capturing enemies, amassing a substantial booty, and being rewarded by Thutmose III with promotions and expensive gifts. They also relate several curious episodes, such as when he killed a mare in heat that the ruler of Kadesh had sent into the ranks of Egyptian chariots to distract the horses, or when he helped the pharaoh kill an elephant after a military operation in Syria. This reference provides tantalizing evidence that the pharaohs of the time hunted elephants in the Syrian region of Niya after having fought their northern enemies. That maneuver sparked panic among the enemy warriors; many of them abandoned their tents and rushed toward Megiddo. The pharaoh s troops set about plundering their camp, which allowed many of the Asian forces to escape. A NARROW PASS Thutmose III leads his troops toward Megiddo through the perilous Aruna pass. Choosing this route was a bold initiative that allowed the pharaoh to surprise the enemy. BRIDGEMAN/ACI Some Asian commanders were hoisted to safety over the walls of Megiddo by those inside who were defending the city. Others must have run northward to get as far away from the Egyptian troops as possible. The chronicles point out with a certain bitterness that if the soldiers of Thutmose III had pursued the fleeing troops in that phase of the confrontation, the victory would have been quick and definitive:  When they [the enemy chiefs] saw his Majesty overwhelming them, they fled headlong [to] Megiddo with terrified faces, abandoning their horses, their chariots of gold and silver, so as to be hoisted up into the town by pulling at their garments. For the people had shut the town behind them, and they now [lowered] garments to hoist them up into the town. Now if his Majesty s troops had not set their hearts to plundering the possessions of the enemies, they would have [captured] Megiddo at this moment.  This portion was less of a battle and more like a series of skirmishes with the Egyptians on the offensive. MISSION MEGIDDO Located on a hill in the north of present-day Israel, Megiddo controlled the important trade route linking Egypt with Mesopotamia in the mid-15th century B.C. ALAMY/CORDON PRESS Siege and victory Faced with the impossibility of taking the city by assault, the Egyptians decided to besiege it, building a series of fortifications with wood they obtained by felling trees in the surrounding area. The Annals of Thutmose III show how he emphasized the strategic importance of conquering Megiddo:  Every prince of every [northern] land is shut up within it, the capture of Megiddo is the capture of a thousand cities!  Finally, after seven months of siege, the city surrendered. Among the enemy leaders captured inside was the ruler of Megiddo. The prince of Kadesh, commander in chief of the Asian coalition, did, however, manage to escape. The Aruna pass A key moment in Thutmose III s triumphant first campaign and conquest of Megiddo was the daring decision made by the pharaoh to enter the Aruna pass. The Canaanite forces had left this route unguarded, believing the pharaoh would not expose his army to the possibility of deadly attack from the high ground on either side of the gorge. By taking this risky route, the Egyptian forces were able to take their enemy by surprise at Megiddo, the fortress where the troops of the princes of Retjenu (as the Egyptians called the region of Syria and Canaan) were concentrated. The Egyptians gave their opponents no time to react. At dawn the next day, they were deployed in three divisions that advanced on the Canaanites and their allies with the intention of subduing their flanks and overwhelming them. Thutmose III was in the central division. Unable to resist the onslaught, the Asian troops fled in disarray and several of their leaders ran to take refuge in the walled city of Megiddo while the Egyptians were engaged in looting their camp. As the Megiddo fortress defenders had closed their gates to prevent the Egyptians from forcing their way in, the fleeing commanders had to be hoisted ignominiously over the city wall by ropes tied to their clothes. Megiddo would finally fall after seven months of siege. An extraordinary booty The written sources preserve a long and detailed list of the booty obtained after the conquest of Megiddo. They indicate that there were 83 enemy dead and 340 prisoners, but these figures may only include individuals who were seen as significant. The Jabal Barkal victory stele, erected by Thutmose III in Nubia, recounts several of his campaigns in Asia. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. FINE ARTS, BOSTON/SCALA, FLORENCE AFTER THE VICTORY AT MEGIDDO, Thutmose consolidated his power to the north, in Asia, and to the south, in Nubia. In the 33rd year of his reign, he launched a direct attack against the Mitanni Empire that had  the anti-Egyptian unrest. Mitanni lay beyond the Euphrates River, so Thutmose transported boats by ox-drawn carts from the coastal city of Byblos (today in Lebanon). Using these boats, the Egyptians were able to cross the Euphrates, crushing the Mitanni state and strengthening Egypt s hold over the whole region. Thutmose III erected a victory stele far in the south of his lands at Jabal Barkal in Nubia, today in Sudan. He characterized himself as conqueror of both southerners and northerners  who massacres the tribes of Asia...and who smites the nomads of Nubia.  Apart from herds, provisions, and other objects, the Egyptian army took 2,041 horses; 924 chariots, among which were the chariots carved in gold belonging to the rulers of Kadesh and Megiddo; 200 sets of armor; and 502 composite bows. These bows, of Mesopotamian origin, were very expensive and highly sought after. The body armor, made of hardened leather or bronze mail, was innovative at that time. There is no mention of helmets, although their use was widespread during the rule of Thutmose III. This is demonstrated both by the lists of tributes from Asia and by the paintings in some private Theban tombs in which foreigners paying tribute are shown wearing helmets.

SCALA, FLORENCE Myth and might The immediate consequence of the victory was the consolidation of pharaonic control over much of what is today Israel and the Palestinian territories. The stunning victory, and expansion of the pharaoh s control, would live in the Egyptian imagination as the beginning of a new era of regional greatness. General Djehuty, appointed governor of the conquered areas by Thutmose, would later be immortalized as the hero in an ancient Egyptian tale,  The Taking of Joppa.  Recounting how Djehuty used his ingenuity to conquer the city of Joppa (modern-day Jaffa, near Tel Aviv, Israel) by smuggling soldiers into the city hidden in baskets, this story preceded the Trojan horse plot device used in Homer s epic poem The Iliad by centuries. It is also a likely source for the Arabic folk tale  Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,  in which the eponymous thieves attempt to smuggle themselves into a house in jars of lamp oil. THUTMOSE THE CONQUEROR This relief at the seventh pylon Karnak Temple Complex symbolizes the victories of Thutmose III over his enemies, who cower as he prepares to crush them with his mace. ALAMY/CORDON PRESS Beyond inspiring great stories, the Megiddo triumph forged new political and diplomatic realities across the region: The new Canaanite territory provided a closer starting point for Egypt to launch future campaigns into Mesopotamia. News of the impressive victory prompted monarchies in the Near East to send ambassadors to Thebes, capital of Egypt, with sumptuous gifts, hoping to curry favor with the pharaoh. (These crocodile mummies are unraveling a mystery) Following his victory, Thutmose III leveraged his position to expand Egypt s power in Asia through an ambitious program of conquests in Syria. The Annals inscribed on the walls of the Temple of Amun-Re at Karnak mention 16 other campaigns, although, in some cases, no details have been preserved. These military operations took place between 1454 and 1437 B.C. and can be divided into distinct phases. The first phase involved the conquest of important port cities, such as Ullaza and Simyra, to facilitate transport to and from Egypt and provide storage points. The second phase involved the occupation of much of central Syria, thereby neutralizing the strength of the city of Kadesh. The third phase consisted of a direct attack on Mitannian territories, while the fourth phase included a series of campaigns aimed at suppressing uprisings in certain conquered territories. Even accounting for Thutmose s campaign of self-mythologization, and the inevitable exaggeration that is built into the claims and boasts of the Annals of Thutmose III, many scholars view the details of this account as a reliable source. In fact, the Battle of Megiddo is one of the earliest well-documented battles of history. This major turning point not only expanded Egyptian territory but also marked the first solo success of one of the greatest military leaders in ancient Egypt.",
            "target_summary": "Pharaoh Thutmose III, demonstrating audacious defiance against his enemies, embarked on a campaign that would etch his name in history by choosing the perilous Aruna Road. Swearing an oath to Amun-Re, he personally led his army through this narrow, eight-mile pass, whose steep walls presented an ideal location for ambush. However, the enemy, deeming such a route too reckless for the Egyptians, had left it entirely unguarded. Thutmose's unwavering resolve allowed his forces to traverse the pass in a single day, emerging into the Qina valley to the utter astonishment of the enemy troops encamped near Megiddo.\n\nAt dawn the following day, the Egyptian army mobilized, advancing in a formidable crescent formation. The ensuing skirmish quickly threw the Asian forces into disarray; many abandoned their valuable chariots and possessions in a panicked flight towards the walled city of Megiddo. Their commanders, overwhelmed, were ignominiously hoisted over the city's closed gates by ropes of cloth. Yet, a swift, decisive victory eluded the Egyptians as their soldiers, distracted by the lure of plunder from the abandoned enemy camp, paused their pursuit, allowing many adversaries to escape.\n\nRecognizing Megiddo's immense strategic importance as a controller of vital trade routes—a city whose capture Thutmose declared akin to \"a thousand cities\"—the pharaoh initiated a rigorous seven-month siege. During this protracted period, figures like Commander Amenemheb distinguished themselves, his tomb chronicles detailing his valor in combat, his accumulation of immense booty, and even his participation with the pharaoh in a dangerous elephant hunt. The steadfast siege finally culminated in Megiddo's surrender, yielding an extraordinary haul: thousands of horses, hundreds of opulent gold and silver chariots, innovative armor, and highly sought-after composite bows, alongside numerous prisoners and vast provisions.\n\nThis monumental triumph at Megiddo profoundly reshaped the ancient Near East, solidifying pharaonic control over Canaan and serving as a crucial launchpad for Egypt's burgeoning empire. Thutmose III leveraged his victory to undertake an ambitious program of conquest across Syria, launching 16 further campaigns. These systematically secured vital port cities, neutralized rival powers like Kadesh, and even saw Egyptian forces transported across the Euphrates to crush the Mitanni Empire. The profound victory not only forged new diplomatic realities, compelling distant monarchies to send tribute and seek favor with Egypt, but also permeated Egyptian culture, inspiring legends such as \"The Taking of Joppa,\" a tale predating the Trojan Horse. Meticulously documented in the Annals of Thutmose III, the Battle of Megiddo stands as one of history's earliest and best-recorded battles, a testament to Thutmose III's strategic brilliance and cementing his legacy as one of ancient Egypt's preeminent military leaders.",

First, the rock walls were covered with plaster, and onto this outlines of the figures were traced with red paint and then corrected with black paint.Next came the artisans, who carved reliefs into the plaster following the painted outlines. Finally, the painters brought to life the walls and ceilings through the use of color. Over time, some layers of stucco that had been applied too thickly began to peel and fall off under their own weight.

A research team led by retired organic chemist Dr. Corrado Malanga and former academic and remote sensing expert Dr. Filippo Biondi, claim to have discovered and reconstructed enormous 38,000-year-old structures buried deep underneath the pyramid of Khafre at Giza. In a press conference held in Italy, Malanga and Biondi announced that through the development of a new proprietary method for interpreting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals, they were able to detect structures two kilometers beneath the Khafre pyramid. According to Malanga and Biondi, they discovered eight shafts, surrounded by spiral pathways, that connect to two 90-meter cube-shaped structures. Above the shafts, they claim to have found five structures connected to one another by passageways. Using what appears to be AI-generated reconstructions, they, and others, have hypothesized that these structures are part of a legendary ancient city or even a prehistoric power-generating structure (i.e. a power station). Rumors of hidden structures underneath the Giza plateau are nothing new. The idea dates to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus and intermittently bubbled to the surface of popular consciousness throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They became particularly popular among French scholars in the 19th century and again in the 20th century when American psychic Edgar Cayce popularized the idea that a secret hall of records was buried underneath the pyramid complex. The concept of a power station, allegedly built by aliens, has also been bouncing around pseudoscientific circles for a while. It is part of a broader conspiracy theory that credits impressive ancient architectural projects to aliens. (How cosmic rays helped find a tunnel in Egypt's Great Pyramid.)

To date, scientists have collected ancient DNA from Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Homo sapiens from 45,000 years ago.  Yet, Egypt has remained a kind of white spot on the map of this big puzzle of human genetic ancestry.  Previously, the oldest DNA recovered from ancient Egypt came from three mummies buried at the Abusir el-Meleq necropolis and dated between 787 and 23 B.C. But those sequences only represented partial genomes. The new genome is complete and comes from an individual who lived some 1,500 years earlier.",

Living some 4,500 to 4,800 years ago, during Egypt's Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods, this man has now yielded a groundbreaking legacy: the first complete ancient Egyptian genome. Despite enduring centuries of scorching heat and even Nazi bombings in Liverpool, his exceptionally preserved DNA, extracted from his teeth, allowed scientists to sequence his entire genetic blueprint. Published in Nature, this discovery represents the oldest and most intact Egyptian DNA ever recovered, dating between 2855 and 2570 B.C. This remarkable survival and subsequent scientific breakthrough fill a significant gap in the global puzzle of human genetic ancestry, illuminating the past of a civilization once a \"white spot\" in ancient DNA research, far surpassing previous partial genomic efforts from much later eras.",

First, the rock walls were covered with plaster, and onto this outlines of the figures were traced with red paint and then corrected with black paint.Next came the artisans, who carved reliefs into the plaster following the painted outlines. Finally, the painters brought to life the walls and ceilings through the use of color. Over time, some layers of stucco that had been applied too thickly began to peel and fall off under their own weight. Remarkably, the damage was relatively minor and the paintings, now restored, provide a unique artistic insight into how the inhabitants of pharaonic Egypt understood death and the afterlife. (How a single battle and one young pharaoh turned Egypt into a superpower) Nefertari s journey to the afterlife The artistic conventions of the day are reflected in how the tomb was painted. Royal tombs were conceived as a microcosm, a world in themselves. The ceilings symbolized the sky, and the floor was the earth the deceased would become a part of. The burial chamber where the sarcophagus of the deceased king or queen was placed represented the kingdom of Osiris, the god of the underworld. It was believed Osiris presided over the tribunal that judged the soul, determining whether the person had been righteous enough to pass into immortality. PRIESTS One of the two sem, or funerary, priests is dressed in leopard s skin and wears a side braid, indicating his youth. The priests received the queen and were in charge of the funeral rites. S. VANNINI/ALBUM If the judgment was favorable, the deceased began their ascent to rebirth with the sun god, Re. This transition involved a challenging journey during which the soul had to demonstrate certain knowledge and make offerings to the divine beings. The phases of this passage were detailed in the Book of the Dead. Nefertari s tomb was decorated and designed to help her on this journey, guiding the queen toward a full and happy life beyond death. The underground world of Osiris Nefertari s funeral ends with the transfer of her mummy to the burial chamber. This is symbolically the domain of Osiris, the god who embodies royal figures after death while simultaneously judging whether or not they are fit to enjoy immortality. Images of Osiris decorate the four pillars that support the room: On each pillar, he appears in human form and in symbolic form as the djed symbol. The mummy of Nefertari is put inside a large pink granite sarcophagus of which the lid, although broken, has been preserved. This sarcophagus is placed in the lower area of the room, which symbolizes the primordial earth, the origin of the world, and all that is in it.",

Despite some natural wear where stucco had loosened, the restored paintings offer invaluable insights into ancient Egyptian beliefs surrounding death and the profound journey to the afterlife.\n\nConceived as a sacred microcosm, the tomb's architecture itself mirrored the cosmos: ceilings depicted the celestial sky, while the floor symbolized the earth. At its heart, the burial chamber served as the kingdom of Osiris, the revered god of the underworld, who presided over the soul's critical judgment. Should the deceased be deemed righteous, a challenging ascent to rebirth alongside the sun god Re would commence, a complex passage detailed in the Book of the Dead and facilitated by the tomb's guiding artistry.\n\nWithin this subterranean realm, funerary priests orchestrated the sacred rites, preparing the queen for her transition. The burial chamber, permeated by the presence of Osiris – depicted in human form and as the enduring djed symbol on its supporting pillars – housed Nefertari's mummy. Encased in a grand pink granite sarcophagus, despite its broken lid, it rested in the room's lowest area, a profound symbol of the primordial earth and the origin of all existence, guiding the queen toward eternal life.",

The name  Miyamoto Musashi  was one of several he used throughout his life, but it was not his given name at birth nor the name on his memorial. Scholars believe it is likely that Musashi was adopted, and translator and scholar Alexander Bennett has suggested that, based on accounts of his behavior and relationships, Musashi might today be recognized as being on the autism spectrum. Musashi was best known for founding the School of Two Swords and is considered a kensei ( sword saint ). (Follow in the footsteps of samurai on this ancient trail.) However, like most samurai of the time, Musashi s talents extended far beyond combat. Musashi came of age during the final years of Japan s Warring States period a century of civil conflict that ended with the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603.

The delicate operation continued the following evening with the transport of the work in an effort that involved nearly 90 people and took more than seven hours. Bayeux s mayor told France 3 that law enforcement escorted two trucks from the museum one containing the 1,000-year-old treasure and the other that acted as a decoy. The tapestry was then taken to a secret storage location, according to the AFP , where it will be held before it makes its way to England. Until now, specifics of tapestry's removal from the museum in Bayeux had been scant, and the exact manner in which it will make its way to England remains a closely guarded secret. A spokesperson from the Bayeux Tapestry Museum declined to comment on the logistics of the operation, citing security reasons, and France s Ministry of Culture did not respond to multiple interview requests. Transporting the tapestry to England by plane has reportedly been ruled out partly due to a loss of climate control on the tarmac, and media reports speculate that the tapestry s trip will involve some form of overland transport,  possibly combining road and rail with a shuttle train.  Before Friday, the Bayeux Tapestry had been moved only twice the first time by Napoleon, who had it displayed in Paris in an effort to drum up support for a planned invasion of England, and the second time in the 1940s during the German Occupation. At one point, the Nazis even conspired to steal the artifact in order to advance a claim that the depicted conquerors were Vikings (and hence Germanic) rather than Normans. The Third Reich did succeed in absconding with a small piece of the cloth, which remained hidden in Germany for decades after the war and is due to be returned to France.",

            "content": "Europeans in the Middle Ages were no strangers to diseases and plagues. When suffering from health problems, they did the same as people today: They looked to medicine in the hope for a cure, or at least for the easing of pain. People bought, ingested, or applied items that are still familiar potions, ointments, and pills. The chemistry of such medication, however, was very different, made from natural substances once believed to have curative, even miraculous, properties. These included precious stones (agate was a remedy for eye complaints, while jasper was thought to counter hemorrhoids); mineral waters; products derived from animals or even humans (nails, urine, blood); and, above all, a great variety of plants. A pharmacopoeia called De Materia Medica by the Greek physician Dioscorides was widely circulated both in the medieval West and the Arab and Muslim world. It included botanical descriptions and medicinal applications for hundreds of plants. Certain plants were credited with a wide range of curative properties. According to Dioscorides, the cyclamen plant can be made into a potion and used to treat everything from jaundice and headaches to constipation, chilblains, acne, and alopecia. Spice merchants (e piciers in French, speziali in Italian) had close ties with apothecaries, as some of the spices they traded from the East were believed to have medicinal properties. Cinnamon and anise, for example, were used to prevent bad breath. Lotions, potions, and poultices would sometimes be prepared by itinerant healers who sold their wares in the streets or door-to-door. But there were also dispensaries called apothecaries (from the Greek word meaning  storehouse ), the precursors of modern pharmacies and drugstores. (The gory history of Europeans eating mummies for health) Nature cure A garden in a 15th-century French miniature, British Library. ALBUM Monasteries often had a special garden or herbularius dedicated to cultivating medicinal plants, known in French as simples, a word that entered English usage. The plants were placed in square beds separated by pathways. Monk hospital The origin of these apothecaries is closely linked to convents, monasteries, and abbeys. Monastic foundations often had places where they could offer hospitality to pilgrims and the poor. Since many of those using these houses, called hospitals, were also sick, the monks sought ways to treat their ailments, and so the word  hospital  acquired its modern sense Monks were suited to be physicians. They had access to scientific books in their libraries, such as the treatise by Dioscorides, and many other texts in circulation in medieval Europe and the Muslim world. They also had the physical resources. Based on their knowledge, monks knew which medicinal plants to cultivate in their monastery gardens. In this way, the first pharmacies were established as distinct rooms or spaces. In Camaldoli, east of Florence, in the 11th century, a monk named Romuald founded a community of Benedictine monks who ran a hospital for the poor. The pharmacy at Camaldoli was referenced as early as 1048. Sixteenth-century sources describe the provision of medicinal herbs from the well-stocked botanical garden.",

Their pharmacopoeia, a vibrant mosaic of traditional knowledge, relied heavily on substances believed to possess inherent curative powers. Medications ranged from potions and ointments crafted from precious stones and mineral waters to surprising animal derivatives, but above all, an extensive variety of plants. Influential texts like the Greek physician Dioscorides' *De Materia Medica* guided practitioners, meticulously detailing hundreds of botanical descriptions and their medicinal applications for ailments spanning jaundice, headaches, and skin conditions. Even exotic spices, traded from the East by merchants, found their way into remedies, with cinnamon and anise, for instance, used to combat bad breath.\n\nThese healing concoctions were dispensed by itinerant healers traversing streets and doors, but also within nascent dispensaries known as apothecaries—literally \"storehouses\"—the direct ancestors of modern pharmacies. Monasteries emerged as cornerstones of medieval healthcare. Within their serene walls, monks cultivated dedicated \"herbularius\" or medicinal gardens, tending \"simples\" (medicinal plants) with meticulous care. These monastic foundations, initially offering hospitality to pilgrims and the poor, evolved into \"hospitals\" in the modern sense, driven by the monks' commitment to treating the sick. Armed with access to extensive libraries containing scientific texts like Dioscorides' treatise, and the physical resources of their gardens, monks became adept physicians. They established the first distinct pharmacy rooms, laying the groundwork for organized medical care. A notable example is the 11th-century Camaldoli monastery near Florence, where Benedictine monks operated a hospital and a well-referenced pharmacy, providing essential herbal remedies from their richly stocked botanical garden.",

(Another French mystery: Who was the \"Man in the Iron Mask?\") Some chroniclers believe that the French Blue didn t go to London with Lordonner. Instead, it arrived much later in a scenario worthy of a political thriller. According to this theory, the revolutionary armies desperately needed a victory around the time Austria and Prussia were threatening to invade France in 1792. Led by the Prussian Duke of Brunswick, an invasion was repelled by the French at Valmy and retreated back over the Rhine on September 20. Revolutionary momentum returned and fervor soared. Sunlight streams through the Apollo Gallery in Paris s Louvre Museum, which showcases France s royal regalia, gems, crowns, and diadems. SYLVAIN SONNET/ALAMY/ACI Skeptics questioned how an experienced and well-equipped Prussian general could be defeated so quickly. They theorized that revolutionary leaders had orchestrated the jewel heist earlier that month in order to bribe the Duke of Brunswick. They would give him the French Blue in return for losing the battle at Valmy. Theorists suspect that years later Brunswick sent the Blue to his daughter, Princess Caroline, in London in 1805.

New Identity In 1812 a blue diamond smaller than the famous French gem passed through the hands of a London dealer named Daniel Eliason. How he acquired it, and to whom he sold it, is a mystery. Eliason showed the stone to the jeweler John Francillon, who made a sketch and described a 45.52-carat  deep blue  diamond  without specks or flaws.  Historians believe it is no coincidence that it reappeared two days after the window for prosecuting crimes committed during the French Revolution expired, perhaps encouraging its owner to sell it.",

Though the spinel and much of the stolen loot were recovered after his failed attempt to sell it in London led to debtors' prison, the French Blue remained elusive. An intriguing theory suggests the diamond's disappearance was far more than mere theft, hinting at a high-stakes political thriller. Revolutionary leaders, desperate to secure a victory against invading forces, may have orchestrated the heist to bribe the Prussian Duke of Brunswick with the French Blue, thereby ensuring his retreat from the pivotal Battle of Valmy in 1792 and turning the tide of the revolution.

Victoria, still in her nightdress, had become queen. That night she wrote in her journal:  Very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what is fit and right than I have.  Victoria s accession marked a significant change. Gone were the old men who had ruled for half a century, replaced by a young queen soon to have her own family. As the future British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli told the House of Commons in a speech in 1861:  She who reigns over us has elected amid all the splendor of empire, to establish her life on the principle of domestic love.  The royal family represented youth, morality, and domesticity now. Changed, too, were the regalia worn by monarchies past. A teenage queen who stood at less than five feet tall needed better-proportioned displays of royal authority. A new coronation ring was made for Victoria, and the shafts of the scepters were altered to enable her to hold them comfortably. The Jewel in the Woman s Crown Among Victoria s magnificent jewels was the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which passed into her possession after the British conquered the Sikh empire in 1849.

He also presented his wife with jewelry of his own design, such as the sapphire and diamond brooch he gave her before their wedding, and a gold and porcelain set, which included a brooch, earrings, and necklace that recalled the wreath of orange blossoms she wore on their wedding day.

            "content": "Since 1759, when the first Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease on St James s Gate Brewery in Dublin, generations of Guinnesses have grown the business, along with a vast fortune and a family legacy based on philanthropy as much as their stout. Ad House of Guinness, a drama now streaming on Netflix, explores a chapter of that fascinating family history in the way that only Peaky Blinders and SAS Rogue Heroes creator Steven Knight can. Starring a riotously charming Anthony Boyle (of Masters of the Air fame) as Arthur Guinness, the eight-part series bills itself as a 19th-century Succession, complete with sibling rivalries, political intrigue and a rebellious spirit   all mixed down with plenty of pints. Who was the real Arthur Guinness? The Arthur Guinness of House of Guinness is not the one who founded the brewery back in 1759. This is his great-grandson, Arthur Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun. He ran the brewery business alongside his brother Edward from 1868 to 1876, as well as sitting in the House of Commons as an MP and giving generously to a host of humanitarian causes. Born on 1 November 1840 in Dublin, Arthur was the eldest son of Elizabeth and Benjamin Lee Guinness, the man responsible for turning the brewery into a truly global giant. Growing up with two brothers, Benjamin and Edward, and a sister, Anne, he received an elite education at Eton and Trinity College Dublin, graduating in 1862.

(Image by Alamy) During its first three generations, Guinness had become the largest brewery in Ireland and a major exporter to Europe, the Americas and parts of Africa. Under the stewardship of Arthur and his youngest brother, Edward Guinness, the brewery continued to thrive; even the temperance movement, which bemoaned the social ills of alcohol, promoted the stout as a preferred alternative to spirits like gin and whiskey. What was Arthur s involvement in the brewery? For Arthur, 1868 would be a life-changing year, beginning with the death of his father. He was elevated to the title of Baronet Guinness of Ashford, which had been created just a year earlier to mark Benjamin Lee s achievements. His father left a fortune of  1.1 million (well over  100 million today) and the Guinness Brewery, the management of which became a partnership between Arthur and the youngest son, Edward. While the middle brother Benjamin and sister Anne received estates and money, they had no say in the business. In the first decade of their ownership, the success of Guinness only expanded, with sales more than doubling from around 350,000 barrels sold in 1868 to almost 779,000 in 1876. In the decades that followed, it would rise to more than a million a year. Was Arthur Guinness a philanthropist? As a major landowner in rural Ireland, Arthur had hundreds of poor tenants. Although more attentive than many landlords, this got him embroiled in the agrarian unrest and occasional violence of the 1880s, known as the Land War, in which several of his employees were murdered. Generally, though, he was considered a generous and conscientious figure, having learned the creed of the Guinness family to favour philanthropy and social responsibility over greed. Did Arthur Guinness commit election fraud? The year 1868 also saw Arthur s election to the UK Parliament as a Conservative MP for the City of Dublin, the seat previously been held by his father. Only a year later, however, the election was voided when it emerged that Guinness agents had used tactics that amounted to corruption and bribery, even offering  5 for every vote. When the matter went to court, it was concluded that Arthur himself had no idea this had happened.

(Image by Ben Blackall/Netflix) It would be another five years before he could win his seat back, in 1874, when he served under the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli until 1880. This was a time of widening divide in Ireland, between the Unionists who wished to stay part of the United Kingdom and nationalists seeking independence. Religion similarly divided the Irish between Protestant and Catholic.  | Who was to blame for the Irish famine? Arthur was a staunch Unionist and Protestant, as all generations of his family had been. In later life, he bought two Unionist newspapers and supported the Irish Unionist Alliance, and the Guinness Brewery s clear stance was cause for some anger among republicans. In 1880, Arthur left the House of Commons as he was raised to the peerage as Baron Ardilaun. What s known about Arthur Guinness s sexuality? In 1871, Arthur married Lady Olivia Charlotte Hedges-White, daughter of the Earl of Bantry. It seemed to be a happy marriage, although childless. The couple became known for their extravagant hospitality, hosting both Queen Victoria and the future George V, and they travelled widely. According to Joe Joyce, author of 2009 The Guinnesses: The Untold Story of Ireland s Most Successful Family, Arthur was  probably gay . Joyce also reported that both Arthur Guinness and the Baroness Ardilaun were content in maintaining the marriage under the agreement that there would be no sexual intercourse. It s a slender claim that the show has taken to heart and run with to riotous conclusions. Certainly, there was no way that same-sex relationships could have been accepted in tandem with success in public life   male homosexuality was legislated against in UK law, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. \"Sodomy (or buggery) were previously a hanging offence in Britain,\" writes Brian Lewis. \"This was modified by the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which replaced capital punishment with minimum sentences of 10 years  imprisonment. The Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 added to the statute book a two-year maximum penalty for 'gross indecency' between men.\" What happened to Arthur Guinness after the events of House of Guinness? In 1876, Arthur made the decision to step back from the brewery, selling his half of the shares to his brother for nearly  700,000. Although that figure made the younger Guinness a fabulously wealthy man, Edward would float the business a few years later on the London Stock Exchange, which made him a multi-millionaire. Arthur helped restore Marsh s Library and extend the Coombe Hospital in Dublin; he  the building of housing for the poor; and, along with his brother, set up the Dublin Exhibition of Arts and Finance to encourage domestic trade. To this day, people can visit St Stephen s Green, a 22-acre public park that Arthur bought, landscaped and gifted to the city in the 1870s and 80s. Was Arthur Guinness assassinated? No, Arthur Guinness was not assassinated, or ever targeted by a Fenian plot to assassinate him. Arthur died on 20 January 1915, at the age of 74. He would be buried in the Dublin suburb of Raheny at All Saints  Church, the building of which he had helped fund several decades earlier. Ad House of Guinness is streaming on Netflix now.

            "title": "Shakespeare s 'lost years': what do we know about this secretive chapter of the bard's life?",
            "content": "The idea that William Shakespeare s life contains a stretch of  lost years  is a minor ghost that haunts popular biographies and discussion of his poems and plays. Those missing years are conventionally taken to begin in February 1585, when Shakespeare s children   twins Judith and Hamnet   were baptised at Stratford upon Avon, and to end in September 1592, when he was described as being  an upstart Crow  in a gossipy pamphlet in London. Ad Between these dates, we have no reliable record that ties Shakespeare to any particular location, or reveals what he was doing. Shakespeare was 20 when his lost years began, and 28 when they ended. Those seven-and-a-half lost years belong in a wider landscape in which we know remarkably little about the playwright. We know virtually nothing for sure about Shakespeare s schooling, which he probably completed in 1578 or so; nor what he did until he married Anne Hathaway in November 1582. Listen on the podcast | What happened in Shakespeare's lost years? This is not only the case for Shakespeare: scholars may hate to admit it, but our ignorance of so much of this period is vast. Almost 60 per cent of the 3,000 different plays written between 1570 and 1642 are lost. While some titles survive, there could be some lost plays that we have never even heard of at all. It is a safe guess, but a guess nonetheless, that plays by Shakespeare are among these wholly lost plays. We are uncertain of even the most basic things. Until the remains of the Elizabethan Curtain playhouse in Shoreditch, London, were discovered in 2012, theatre historians assumed that it was round; it turned out to be rectangular. Why the lost years matter Shakespeare s undocumented years have a special quality: enigmatic, evocative and instructive. As those years began, Shakespeare was a young man in a provincial town who had written nothing and had few prospects. When they ended, he was celebrated enough as a playwright to be worth attacking. The lost years are exactly the period of his genesis as a writer. What has filled those years is a series of guesses and rumours. Half a century after Shakespeare s death, the 17th-century antiquarian John Aubrey began collecting anecdotes and stories about Shakespeare from people who had known him, notably the son of an actor who had been a member of Shakespeare s company. The lost years are exactly the period of his genesis as a writer Aubrey recounts, in his Brief Lives   a collection of short biographies   two slightly different stories about those lost years.  This William being inclined naturally to Poetry and acting,  Aubrey wrote,  came to London I guess about 18 and was an Actor at one of the Play-houses and did act exceedingly well.  Then a little later, he added:  he had been in his younger years a School-master in the Country.  The two stories don t quite fit together: a diligent, rural Shakespeare versus a theatrical, London one. But they establish the two main traditions of thinking about this time. Shakespeare, depicted in a later image based on a contemporary portrait. His dramatic works shed light on Elizabethan and Jacobean society, and on views of history. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) The writer and poet Nicholas Rowe prepared the first real biography of Shakespeare for his own edition of Shakespeare s plays published in 1709. Rowe had apparently not read Aubrey, but he offers an expanded version of the first idea. He repeats a Stratford legend, that the young Shakespeare fell into  ill company  and poached a deer from a local gentleman. The ensuing trouble meant he had to flee to London, where he found work at a playhouse. There, suggests Rowe,  his admirable Wit, and the natural Turn of it to the Stage, soon distinguish d him, if not as an extraordinary actor, yet as an excellent Writer .  | Did someone else write the plays of William Shakespeare? The real history that debunks the conspiracy This is an echo, or revision, of Aubrey s first story. Another version, which circulated in the 17th century, was that the young Shakespeare held the horses at the playhouse door. The alternative and less thespian description of Shakespeare also pops up in the early biographies. Edmond Malone, in his great edition of the plays (1790) and the biographical essay which accompanies it, extended Rowe s biography into a much more reliable timeline of Shakespeare s life and works. This edition is the foundation of much later textual study, and while it is a mountain of scholarship it is not without a little sentimental speculation. In it, Malone speculates that after leaving school, Shakespeare was  employed, while he yet remained at Stratford, in the office of some country attorney . Perhaps so: it is worth noting that Malone himself had trained as a barrister. Along with the development of Shakespeare biography, and the beginnings of careful scholarly work on the texts of the plays, came the realisation that some things were unknown. We might say that the lost years are really a sign of how much has been found; it was only once much was known, with some degree of confidence, that the idea of  lost years  emerged. In a further apparent paradox, in the early 20th century the phrase itself became less an admission of ignorance than a boast about knowledge. Player, teacher, clerk? Those keenest to use the phrase have been those most sure they have the answer. Arthur Acheson s 1920 book Shakespeare s Lost Years in London, 1586-1592 confidently uses the phrase  lost years    and sometimes  dark years    to refer to this specific period, but only to find them to be not so lost at all. His book discovers Shakespeare, as in Rowe, arriving early in London. E A J Honigmann s 1985 book Shakespeare: The  Lost Years  places him back in the countryside: in Lancashire, working in the household of a Catholic family in Lancashire, perhaps as a player (actor), or a tutor. In each case, that  lost  is rhetorical. There is no evidence that he was not, say, a pirate or a mercenary in those years Shakespeare the player, the teacher, the clerk: the timidity of the suggestions is revealing. There is no evidence that he was not, say, a pirate or a mercenary in those years. But what he wasn t tells us much about him. Shakespeare was not at university, while so many of his contemporary playwrights were. He was not a spy, while his great rival Christopher Marlowe was, in the same period of his life. The lost years mark him as apart and this is why they matter both as an episode and a story. They say: here is a mystery. Your attempt to solve it may reveal something only about you. Shakespeare got there first, of course. In the middle of his play The Winter s Tale, a character called Time enters, and addresses the audience: Impute it not a crime To me, or my swift passage, that I slide O er sixteen years, and leave the growth untried Of that wide gap. Between the first and second halves of the play, 16 years have disappeared, and Time offers an apology that soon turns into a boast: Of that wide gap, since it is in my power To o er throw law, and in one self-born hour To plant and o erwhelm custom. The lost years are Shakespeare s self-born hour. In them, he exits the world of conventional, discoverable biography, and enters the world of the theatre, of play and invention.

            "target_summary": "A persistent phantom in Shakespearean biography, the concept of his \"lost years\" describes a seven-and-a-half-year silence in the historical record, stretching from his children's baptism in Stratford in February 1585, when he was 20, to his emergence as a celebrated \"upstart Crow\" playwright in London by September 1592. This enigmatic period reveals no reliable trace of his whereabouts or activities, casting a profound shadow over his early adulthood. Yet, these silent years are far from insignificant. They possess a special, almost mystical, quality: enigmatic, evocative, and profoundly instructive. They mark Shakespeare's metamorphosis from a young man of scant prospects in a provincial town, who had penned nothing of note, into a burgeoning playwright celebrated enough to provoke fierce rivalry. This crucial interval represents nothing less than his genesis as a writer.\n\nThe absence of definitive documentation for Shakespeare's early life is not unique, as much of the Elizabethan theatrical world remains shrouded in mystery, with countless plays and even the designs of playhouses lost to time. However, the \"lost years\" hold a particular fascination, prompting centuries of biographers to fill the void with a tapestry of legend and reasoned conjecture.\n\nThe earliest glimpses into this lacuna come from John Aubrey in the 17th century, who relayed conflicting anecdotes: one of Shakespeare as a London actor, another as a rural schoolmaster. Nicholas Rowe, in his 1709 biography, expanded upon the former, adding a Stratford legend of deer poaching forcing the young playwright's flight to London, where his \"admirable Wit\" quickly distinguished him. Later, Edmond Malone speculated about Shakespeare potentially working as a country attorney.\n\nParadoxically, as scholarship advanced, the phrase \"lost years\" transformed from an admission of ignorance into a rhetorical boast, with subsequent biographers confidently claiming to have \"found\" Shakespeare during this time—whether in London or in the Lancashire countryside as a player or tutor. The timidity of these suggestions (player, teacher, clerk) is revealing, contrasting starkly with the more dramatic lives of contemporaries like Christopher Marlowe, a known spy, or university-educated playwrights. These choices underscore Shakespeare's distinct path, marking him as apart from his peers.\n\nUltimately, these \"lost years\" transcend mere biographical gaps; they represent Shakespeare's own \"self-born hour,\" echoing the character of Time in *The Winter's Tale*, who effortlessly \"slides o'er sixteen years.\" This period allowed Shakespeare to exit the conventional, discoverable world of biography and fully immerse himself in the transformative realm of theatre, play, and invention. The enduring mystery of these years continues to invite speculation, often revealing more about the inquirer than about Shakespeare himself.",

            "title": "The ingenious Roman invention that sparked the ancient empire s obsession with luxury",
            "content": "Think of Roman engineering, and it might be the grandest feats that first come to mind: the towering aqueducts bringing water to towns and cities, the amphitheatres filled with cheering crowds, and the paved roads that stitched the Roman empire together. Ad The hypocaust   the Roman system of underfloor heating   may be less staggering in its scale, but it remains one of the most recognisable features of Roman domestic life. Archaeologists still point to those distinctive stacks of bricks beneath villa floors as a mark of Roman sophistication.  The hypocaust system is really important for us to think about when we consider Roman homes,  explains Dr Hannah Platts on the HistoryExtra podcast.  It was important to them: that it heated their baths and their other spaces.  But they weren t for everyone. Who owned homes with underfloor heating? And what did such comfort say about status and power?  I should reiterate, having your own bathhouse or having a hypocaust was a luxury,  says Platts. Rome s underfloor miracle At its simplest, a hypocaust worked by circulating hot air through a hollow space beneath the floor. A furnace, or praefurnium, was stoked outside the building; hot air from the furnace was funnelled into a network of small brick pillars (pilae) that supported a raised floor. But it wasn t just about heating the floor.  | How and why did the Roman empire fall?  The hypocaust was used to heat houses via underfloor heating, but actually we ve got a number of houses where we ve got evidence of box flue tiles in the walls,  says Platts.  So we know that hypocausts could heat the walls of the rooms as well.  In the context of ancient Rome this was engineering of incredible sophistication. Archaeological remains from sites such as Pompeii and Ostia, and across Roman Britain, show entire suites of rooms heated by the system. Stepping barefoot on a mosaic floor, warmed from underneath, was quite literally to step upon Roman ingenuity. The Roman baths at Salamis, dating to the 3rd century, feature a well-preserved hypocaust system beneath the tepidarium, or warm room. This network of brick pillars once channelled hot air under and through the floors. (Photo by Getty Images) From the baths to the villa The hypocaust began as a public luxury, eventually exported to private homes. The earliest examples appeared in the great bath complexes (thermae) of the late republic and early empire. Roman baths were vast public leisure centres and required consistent, large-scale heating. The first recorded Roman hypocausts date to the first century BC, developed under architects and engineers serving figures such as Marcus Agrippa, the ally and later son-in-law of the Roman emperor Augustus. Under Augustus himself, public bathhouses multiplied across Rome and its provinces. The technique soon spread to private villas, where the wealthy adapted public comfort for domestic display. By the second century AD, during the reigns of emperors such as Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, the hypocaust had become a standard feature of elite architecture across the empire   from the Mediterranean heartlands to the frontier forts of Britain. The price of luxury But this warmth came at a cost.  We know that the idea of heating your house was really important, but it wasn t for everyone,  says Platts.  To have a hypocaust system in one s house was a big sign of wealth. It would generally only have been present in examples of really opulent and wealthy dwellings: dwellings that, for example, might have their own private bathhouses.  They didn t even need to go to the general baths. They could just have fun in their own spaces.  And, Platts says, what often goes forgotten is that maintaining heat from a hypocaust was hard.  | Everything you wanted to know about the Roman emperors  It took significant effort to build [and] to maintain,  says Platts. Fires had to be constantly fed with wood, ash cleared away and airways cleaned.  There s engineering skill behind it too,  says Platts.  Not everyone is going to be able to build a hypocaust. There is a huge amount of skill behind that building process, and then you ve actually got to be able to run the hypocaust and have it working. It really would ve taken considerable finances to build a hypocaust within your house.  The result was that the hypocaust became an unmistakable badge of wealth. Visitors entering a villa with warm floors knew instantly that they stood in the home of someone of status. This Roman mosaic from Sousse, Tunisia, shows the poet Virgil seated between the muses Clio and Melpomene as he writes the Aeneid. (Photo by Getty Images) The Roman world of privilege and luxury The hypocaust was one element within the broader picture of Roman luxury. For the upper classes, architecture, fashion, and food all worked together to display wealth and taste.  What also would be luxuries could be the way in which people spent their fortunes in other ways,  Platts says.  I m thinking about fashionable clothing, or elaborate jewellery or gemstones. Romans loved amber. They loved pearls. They had quite a thing for uncut diamonds   as we all might   and things that were imported: ivory imported from Africa, silks imported from towards China.  The global reach of the Roman empire fed its appetite for exotic goods. To own these luxuries, to eat peppered dishes and dress in silk, was to embody the luxuries of empire.  Anything like fine wines, exotic spices, was a really good way of showing your status,  Platts notes. In this way, food became another way to demonstrate power. Enslaved servants circulated trays of imported delicacies from Britain, Syria and Africa, served to guests in rooms warmed by the hypocaust. Living symbols of servitude Luxury in Rome was also inseparable from labour, says Platts.  Whilst owning a slave in and of itself was not a luxury   Rome was a slave-based economy, and actually, even many of the really relatively poor households would likely have one or two enslaved people living under their roofs   the number of slaves you had, where they came from, and how skilled they were, that really was a sign of wealth and luxury.  For the Roman elites, warm homes   and the people who kept them running   were signs of sophistication and wealth combined. The hypocaust might not have been as spectacular as an aqueduct or as imposing as an amphitheatre, but it does symbolise a crucial fact of ethos of the Roman empire: it shows how innovative engineering served comfort for the wealthy as much as conquest on the frontiers. Ad Hannah Platts was speaking to Emily Briffett on the HistoryExtra podcast. Listen to the full conversation.",
            "target_summary": "While Roman engineering often evokes images of monumental aqueducts and grand amphitheatres, the **hypocaust**—an innovative underfloor heating system—reveals a more intimate yet equally sophisticated aspect of Roman life. These distinctive networks of brick pillars beneath floors stand as archaeological testaments to Roman ingenuity and domestic luxury.\n\nAt its core, the hypocaust was a marvel of ancient engineering. Furnaces, stoked externally, channeled scorching hot air through hollow spaces formed by **pilae** (small brick pillars) supporting a raised floor. This ingenious design not only warmed mosaic floors, inviting occupants to step barefoot on a tangible display of Roman cleverness, but also extended its comforting heat to walls via intricate box flue tiles, creating entire suites of cozily warmed rooms.\n\nBeginning as a public luxury in the sprawling **thermae** (bath complexes) of the late Republic and early Empire, the hypocaust eventually migrated to private residences. By the 2nd century AD, it became a coveted standard feature in elite villas across the vast Roman Empire, from its Mediterranean heartlands to the frontier forts of Britain, transforming public comfort into a private display of affluence.\n\nYet, this lavish warmth carried a significant price tag, cementing the hypocaust's status as a profound badge of wealth. As Dr. Hannah Platts explains, its construction demanded considerable financial outlay and specialized engineering skill. Moreover, maintaining such a system was an arduous, continuous task, requiring constant feeding of furnaces, clearing of ash, and meticulous upkeep of airways. Thus, only the most opulent households, often boasting their own private bathhouses, could sustain such a costly amenity.\n\nThe hypocaust was but one thread in the rich tapestry of Roman aristocratic luxury, where every element—from architecture to fashion and cuisine—served to proclaim wealth and refined taste. Elite Romans adorned themselves with silks, elaborate jewelry, and precious imported goods like ivory, amber, and exotic spices, demonstrating their global reach and status. Crucially, this privileged existence, including the steady warmth of their homes, was inextricably linked to **enslaved labor**. While slavery was widespread, the quantity, origin, and specialized skills of one's enslaved household significantly amplified one's social standing and capacity for luxury.\n\nIn essence, the hypocaust, though less colossal than its architectural cousins, powerfully symbolizes the Roman Empire's dual genius: harnessing groundbreaking engineering not only for conquest and public works but also for cultivating an exclusive realm of comfort and opulent display for its privileged elite.",

            "content": "Roman society was acutely hierarchical. Every occupation carried a moral weight, and the line between dignity and dishonour was a stark one. A senator who spoke in the law courts could win eternal repute, but a gladiator who risked his life to entertain the masses was branded socially devalued, and the same was true of actors. Ad No matter how dazzling their performances in front of a packed theatre might be, their profession consigned them to the lowest rungs of society. By law they were infamis; people of ill repute, stripped of civic rights and grouped alongside the enslaved. But what was this paradoxical life of stardom and shame really like for the actors of the Roman empire? Roman theatre s golden age under Augustus  When we talk about a golden age of Roman theatre, we tend to be talking about Emperor Augustus s reign and the beginning of the Roman empire,  says Jessica Clarke, author of A New History of Ancient Roman Theatre, speaking on the HistoryExtra podcast.  This was a period with new cultural, religious and political structures being implemented.  Augustus was the first emperor of Rome, ruling from 27 BC until AD 14. And he grasped how useful theatre could be as a political tool.  | The worst Roman emperors Spectacle was part of a strategy that Romans would come to call panem et circenses, or bread and circuses: free food and entertainment offered to the populace in return for loyalty and social cohesion. Drama and performance helped bind audiences into a shared Roman identity and provided a stage (quite literally) for imperial ideology. This 1st-century AD mosaic from the House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii depicts the staging of a theatrical performance. Such scenes highlight the importance of theatre in Roman cultural life, blending entertainment with expressions of myth, satire, and social commentary. (Photo by Getty Images) A web of theatres across the Roman empire  Augustus built hundreds of theatres across the Roman empire, all following the design of the theatre that he also built for himself in Rome,  Clarke explains.  These theatres are enormous, they re spread across all of the provinces. Essentially, what he built was a web of entertainment venues that Rome was in charge of.  These theatres were architectural marvels in themselves. The Theatre of Marcellus in Rome, inaugurated by Augustus in 13 BC and named after his nephew, could seat more than 10,000 people. Its semicircular rows of stone seating rose above a wide orchestra space and a stage backed by the towering scaenae frons; a richly decorated permanent backdrop of columns, niches and statues. Men and women alike could attend the performances at this new wave of theatres, (unlike in Greece, where women were mostly banned from attending) and seating was arranged by social rank, with senators and equestrians   members of the second-highest social class   in prime positions, and the poor higher up. Performances ranged from solemn tragedies to ribald comedies, farcical mimes and elaborate pantomimes accompanied by music and dance. Admission was usually free, funded by magistrates or emperors seeking popularity. Who performed and who was excluded The Roman stage, however, was overwhelmingly male. As in Greece, women were largely banned from treading the boards. Clarke points to the existence of scant evidence of female performers in mime and pantomime   forms considered lower status and more risqu    but official theatre roles were reserved for men.  It s quite similar to Shakespearean rules around who is allowed to step onto a stage,  says Clarke.  Though it would have been slightly easier for men to play the female roles because they had masks on.  Masks, made of linen and plaster or occasionally wood, were central to performance, and not just because they made it easier for men to portray women; they exaggerated expressions and amplified voices too.

Listen to all episodes now On the Ides of March 44 BC, the most famous Roman in history was murdered. Julius Caesar's assassination transformed Rome forever, and the image of his bloody toga has haunted monarchs and tyrants ever since. Actors as infamis No amount of training or talent could lift an actor out of the social stigma that came with the role.  In ancient Rome, acting was an incredibly lowly profession,  says Clarke.  It wasn t something that was seen as an acceptable job for a Roman citizen to undertake. An actor was in the class known as infamis.  This was the same class as a slave; the same class as a prostitute. You would have no voting rights, and you also don t have bodily autonomy, so you don t have legal rights over your body,  Clarke explains. Why this disdain? Roman moralists believed that a respectable citizen should preserve dignitas (dignity) and gravitas (seriousness). To display one s body on stage, to impersonate others, or to provoke laughter was considered undignified. The actor sold their body and voice for public pleasure, which made the profession inherently shameful. This attitude was consistent with how Roman society viewed other entertainers. Gladiators might achieve celebrity in the arena, and charioteers could command passionate fan followings, but both were technically degraded in status. Performers were celebrated in spectacle but lacked any standing in civic life. The life of a Roman actor Evidence from inscriptions, satirical writings and contracts paints a picture of precariousness. Troupes travelled from town to town, dependent on festivals and civic sponsorship for work, while pay was unreliable; some actors received generous gifts, others little more than food and board. The constant would have been the rehearsals. Actors trained their voices to carry across open-air theatres, practised precise gestures codified to signal emotions and maintained the masks, costumes and props essential for performance. Injuries would have been common, especially in physical pantomimes involving acrobatics.  | The overshadowed ancient empire that rivalled Rome with maritime might and an iron fist  But that doesn t mean that we don t know about some very famous actors,  says Clarke.  One we know of is called Clodius Aesopus. He was the most famous tragic actor in the late Republic. Cicero was friends with him.  Aesopus, active in the first century BC, was celebrated for bringing Greek classics to Roman audiences. As Clarke notes, he became a personal acquaintance of Marcus Tullius Cicero, one of Rome s greatest statesmen, orators and philosophers, whose speeches still survive as masterpieces of Latin prose. That such a figure could publicly befriend an actor underscores the inherent paradox: Aesopus was admired, wealthy and socially connected, yet in law he remained infamis. Life as a Roman actor was full of strange contradictions. The art form of theatre was a powerful political tool, theatres themselves were magnificent constructions, audiences were vast and enthusiastic, and some performers became famous enough to mingle with Rome s elite. Yet the profession itself stripped actors of rights and respect. It was a life lived in the spotlight, but without dignity.

            "target_summary": "Roman society was acutely hierarchical, placing public performers like actors and gladiators at its lowest rungs, branding them \"infamis\" – people of ill repute. Despite their ability to captivate vast audiences, actors were stripped of civic rights, lacked bodily autonomy, and were legally grouped with enslaved individuals and prostitutes. This profound societal disdain stemmed from a Roman value system that highly prized \"dignitas\" (dignity) and \"gravitas\" (seriousness), deeming the public display of one's body or the impersonation of others as inherently undignified and shameful.\n\nParadoxically, this era of social degradation also marked a golden age for Roman theatre, particularly under Emperor Augustus's reign (27 BC - AD 14). Augustus masterfully utilized theatre as a potent political instrument, integrating spectacles into his \"panem et circenses\" (bread and circuses) strategy to foster loyalty, ensure social cohesion, and subtly propagate imperial ideology. To support this grand vision, he oversaw the construction of a vast network of magnificent theatres across the empire, echoing the colossal design of his own theatre in Rome. These architectural marvels, such as the Theatre of Marcellus which accommodated over 10,000 spectators, boasted elaborate backdrops and welcomed both men and women, albeit with seating rigidly segregated by social rank. Performances encompassed a rich variety, from solemn tragedies and farcical mimes to elaborate pantomimes, often offered free to the public.\n\nThe stage, however, was overwhelmingly male. Actors, predominantly men, relied on linen, plaster, or wooden masks not only to amplify their voices and exaggerate expressions but also to portray female roles, with only scant evidence of women performing in lower-status forms like mime. An actor's life was demanding and precarious; troupes constantly travelled, relying on festivals and civic sponsorship, and pay was notoriously unreliable. Rigorous training in voice projection, codified gestures, and meticulous maintenance of masks and costumes were essential, and physical injuries were common.\n\nYet, amidst this legal disenfranchisement, a fascinating contradiction emerged: some actors achieved immense celebrity and wealth. Notable figures like Clodius Aesopus, a celebrated tragic actor of the late Republic, were so admired that they forged personal acquaintances with Rome's elite, including the esteemed statesman Cicero. Thus, the Roman actor navigated a life of profound paradox: a publicly celebrated figure whose art served as a powerful political tool, performing in grand venues before enthusiastic crowds, yet simultaneously branded \"infamis,\" legally dispossessed, and denied fundamental dignity. Their existence was one brilliantly illuminated by the spotlight, yet perpetually shadowed by deep societal shame.",

            "title": "The Strange Christian Afterlife of Pontius Pilate",
            "content": "Towards the end of the second century AD the pagan intellectual Celsus wrote an anti-Christian treatise mocking belief in Jesus Christ. If Jesus really had been the Son of God, he asked, why hadn t God punished Pontius Pilate, the man responsible for crucifying him? Why had Pilate not been driven insane or torn apart, like the characters in Greek myths? Why had no calamity befallen him? While there are plenty of later Christian traditions about the punishment of Pontius Pilate, all of these seem to belong to a period long after Celsus was writing. Celsus  challenge, and the response of early Christians to it, suggests that there was more than a kernel of truth in the claim that the Prefect of Judaea had evaded misfortune. This is implicit from the efforts early Christians made to absolve him of responsibility for the Crucifixion. The only reliable statement we have about Pilate s life after his time in Judaea comes from the pen of the Jewish writer Josephus. In his Antiquities of the Jews, written about 60 years after the events, Josephus states that Pilate was recalled to Rome after his mishandling of a riot involving the Samaritans in AD 36. For this he would have expected to face a hearing before the Emperor Tiberius, the aged but uncompromising ruler who had appointed him ten years earlier. Pilate hurried back, but by the time he arrived, in March AD 37, the ailing Tiberius had died. A new emperor, Caligula, had taken up the reins of power. What happened next is guesswork. Josephus says nothing more about him, implying that there was no hearing. Perhaps, in the general euphoria surrounding Caligula s accession, his case was put on hold, or simply forgotten. Maybe the hearing did go ahead and he was acquitted. For all we know, he was given another posting. The lack of a suitably grisly fate for Pilate put Christian apologists in a quandary. As governor, it was Pilate s job to pass judgement in capital cases: he was the one who condemned Jesus to suffer on the cross. There was no circumventing his guilt. Divine punishment should have followed. Yet in the early years of Christianity it was difficult to make such claims. The Roman state was suspicious of the new cult and, if Christians wanted to avoid confrontation, it was best not to accuse one of Rome s officials of deicide. The canonical Gospels stressed that Pilate was not fully to blame. He could find no fault in Jesus:  I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him , Pilate declares in Luke s Gospel. John has Pilate twice announce  I find no basis for a charge against him . The apocryphal Gospel of Peter, thought by many scholars to be among the earliest Christian texts, went even further. In this, Pilate and his soldiers play no part in the crowd s mocking or torturing of Jesus. He himself declares  I am pure from the blood of the Son of God  and, together with his soldiers, who guard the tomb of Jesus, he conspires to keep the miracle of the Resurrection secret from the Jewish priests. The tradition of a blameless Pilate, a witness to the Passion, led to a strange early Christian fascination with him. By the second century AD, fake letters of Pilate, recounting the wondrous story of Jesus, circulated among the faithful. The so-called Acts of Pilate, allegedly deriving from the governor s own records, portray Pilate as a convert. Tertullian, the late second-century Christian theologian, described Pilate as someone  who himself also in his own conscience was now a Christian  and alleged that Tiberius was so convinced by Pilate s reports that he would have placed Jesus among the Roman gods had not the Senate refused. So influential were the various versions of the Acts of Pilate that in the early fourth century the Roman state created and promoted an anti-Christian,  true , pagan version in an attempt to discredit the Christian ones. Needless to say this was no more reliable than its rivals. All of this might seem merely capricious, but the absolution of Pilate came at a terrible cost. The early Christians shifted the blame for the Crucifixion onto others. A rebuttal of the arguments of Celsus, written by the third-century bishop Origen, shows this clearly:  It was not so much Pilate that condemned Him,  he wrote,  as the Jewish nation . Celsus had chosen the wrong culprit; and the fact that the Jewish nation had been torn apart by the Romans and dispersed across the face of the earth was proof of God s retribution. The fake letters and the Christian versions of the Acts of Pilate said much the same thing, as did other Christian apologists. The Acts went so far as to have the Jewish crowd telling Pilate that they willingly accept the blood-guilt, an echo of the Gospel of Matthew, which has the same crowd shouting  his blood be on us and our children!  These claims formed a basis for Christian persecution of the Jews right up to modern times. Pilate s costly absolution was the product of specific religious and political circumstances. When the Roman Empire became a Christian state in the fourth century, there was no longer any need to emphasise his innocence. The Nicene Creed, formulated under Emperor Constantine in AD 325 and emended in AD 381, stated bluntly that Christ  was crucified under Pontius Pilate . It became acceptable to cast Pilate as a villain and a range of myths developed describing his grisly end. Some influential Christians demurred, however. Saint Augustine, writing in the sixth century, argued that when Pilate wrote on the cross  Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews , he really meant it:  It could not be torn from his heart that Jesus was the King of the Jews.  While the West went on to develop the tradition of a  bad  Pilate who was punished for his misdeeds, the Eastern Church preferred a more sympathetic interpretation. Not only was Pilate a Christian; he was a confessor and even a martyr. One eastern text, The Handing Over of Pilate, has Tiberius ordering the governor to be beheaded for having allowed the Crucifixion to go ahead. First Pilate repents and then a voice from heaven proclaims that all nations will bless him, because under his governorship the prophecies about Christ were fulfilled. Finally an angel takes charge of his severed head. In some accounts he is buried with his wife and two children next to the tomb of Jesus   the ultimate martyr s sepulchre. In the Gospel of Matthew, Pilate s wife warns her husband not to harm Jesus and for this she achieved sainthood among Orthodox Christians. The Copts and Christians of Ethiopia took the next step and canonised Pilate himself. An Ethiopian collection of hagiographies lists St Pilate s Day as the 25th of the summer month of Sanne, a day shared with his wife Procla and the saints Jude, Peter and Paul: Salutation to Pilate, who washed his hands To show he himself was innocent of the blood of Jesus Christ Those familiar with the western tradition may find the idea of St Pontius Pilate curious or even absurd. But the fascination with Pilate never abates. From the Acts of Pilate to Mikhail Bulgakov s novel The Master and Margerita, the man who cross-examined and crucified Jesus remains an enigma, a shadowy metaphor for opposites: equivocation and stubbornness, cowardice and heroism, cruelty and clemency. His dilemma   to do the right thing or the popular thing   is every ruler s quandary. Perhaps that is why people can sympathise with him: we too must sometimes face a difficult choice; though, fortunately for us, its legacy is likely to be less enduring.

            "target_summary": "The enigmatic figure of Pontius Pilate has long provoked divergent interpretations, stemming from a crucial challenge posed in the late second century AD by the pagan intellectual Celsus. He critically observed that Pilate, the Roman governor responsible for Jesus's crucifixion, appeared to have evaded any divine punishment, unlike those who offended the gods in classical myths. This lack of a calamitous fate for Pilate posed a significant quandary for early Christians, especially since historical accounts, such as Josephus's *Antiquities of the Jews*, merely state that Pilate was recalled to Rome in AD 36 for misgovernance and his ultimate fate beyond that is unknown, suggesting no dramatic downfall.\n\nTo navigate this dilemma, early Christian apologists sought to absolve Pilate, a politically prudent move given the Roman state's suspicion of the new cult. Canonical Gospels, particularly Luke and John, subtly began to distance Pilate from full culpability, depicting him as finding no fault in Jesus and attempting to release him. Apocryphal texts, such as the *Gospel of Peter*, went even further, entirely exonerating Pilate and his soldiers, portraying him as a witness to the Passion, even conspiring to conceal the Resurrection miracle. This burgeoning tradition of a blameless, even sympathetic, Pilate led to a peculiar early Christian fascination. Spurious \"Acts of Pilate\" circulated, depicting him as a convert or even a secret Christian, a view endorsed by theologians like Tertullian, who believed Pilate was \"Christian in his own conscience.\" So influential were these narratives that the Roman state itself countered with its own \"true\" pagan versions to discredit them.\n\nHowever, Pilate's absolution came at a terrible cost. To deflect blame, early Christians, exemplified by Bishop Origen, tragically shifted responsibility for the crucifixion onto \"the Jewish nation.\" This dangerous narrative, echoing sentiments in Matthew's Gospel where the crowd accepts \"his blood be on us and our children,\" became a foundation for centuries of anti-Jewish persecution.\n\nWith the Roman Empire's eventual embrace of Christianity in the fourth century, the imperative to exonerate Pilate waned. The Nicene Creed bluntly stated Christ \"was crucified under Pontius Pilate,\" allowing for a divergence in his portrayal. The Western Church largely embraced a \"bad\" Pilate, deserving of punishment for his role. Conversely, the Eastern Church cultivated a far more sympathetic view, regarding Pilate as a confessor, even a martyr. Texts like *The Handing Over of Pilate* depict his repentance, a heavenly blessing, and even an angelic burial. His wife, Procla, achieved sainthood for her warning to him, and remarkably, the Coptic and Ethiopian Churches canonized Pilate himself, celebrating his feast day alongside other saints.\n\nUltimately, Pontius Pilate endures as a compelling, ambiguous figure, transcending historical fact to become a powerful metaphor for fundamental human struggles. His dilemma—to pursue justice or appease the masses—resonates as a universal quandary of leadership, embodying the tension between cowardice and courage, cruelty and clemency. This enduring fascination ensures that the man who presided over one of history's pivotal events remains an enigma, prompting ongoing reflection on moral choice and its lasting legacy.",

            "title": "Whose Authority?",
            "content": "How did the idea of a European secular society come about? In this startlingly original book, David Lloyd Dusenbury argues that the separation of politics and religion, of  church and state , can be attributed to a thread of Christian thought rooted in the Gospel accounts of the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate and in subsequent discourses over whether or not Pilate could be held guilty of having ordered  the death of God . This is not a book about Pontius Pilate, nor is it a book about what actually happened in the trial of Jesus. Both topics were of great interest to early Christian apologists, their pagan critics and a parade of later thinkers; and it is these rich intellectual traditions that the book exploits to make its case. Who condemned Jesus, and why, and did they have the right to do so? We encounter a patchwork of competing claims: for example, that Pilate refused to condemn Jesus; or that he condemned him, but believed him innocent; or that he condemned him as a criminal. The Christian accommodation of the tradition that Pilate was guilty in one sense, but innocent in another, is the one that informs the main thrust of the book s argument. Pilate was doing his duty as the representative of a secular power, but did not understand that Jesus was Christ: he was thus, through ignorance, innocent of the charge of deicide, but he nonetheless ordered Jesus  execution. Central to the thesis is the statement Jesus makes before Pilate in the Gospel of John (18:36):  My kingdom is not of this world.  References to Jesus  renunciation of worldly kingdoms can also be found in other parts of the New Testament. The book argues that his refusal to claim this dominion, or to save himself from crucifixion (even though his divine power could have enabled it) had important political consequences in the late antique Mediterranean and medieval Europe. St Augustine s reading of the trial in John emerges as a kind of early manifesto for the division of the sacred realm from what we would call the  secular . For Augustine, Jesus  accusers and Pilate are innocent because they act in ignorance ( they know not what they do , Luke 23:34), but when Pilate sentences Jesus, he does so according to the justice of the saeculum (i.e. the temporal realm, as opposed to the eternal). As the representative of temporal power, Pilate fulfilled his legal responsibility: this is his  innocence . The justice of the saeculum is a form of justice, but imperfect compared to the justice of an all-knowing God.  Truth is not subject to human empire , as the 17th-century legal theorist Samuel Pufendorf has it. From this partition of power and justice, between an imperfect worldly realm based on coercion and an eternal one based on the persuasive power of Christian religious truth, arises the idea of the secular. This twofold partition of prerogatives had a practical aim: it helped the church to maintain its authority while avoiding conflict with political leaders who had military (coercive) power. After the conversion of Constantine to Christianity, church leaders strove to find a way to accommodate Roman imperial power without surrendering to it. Pope Gelasius I (492-96), who, like Augustine, hailed from north Africa, distinguished sacred from secular rule, reassuring the emperor Anastasius that the papacy had no interest in controlling the temporal realm. Yet six centuries later the papacy seemed to renege on this separation and persisted in its claim to worldly authority through medieval times. For critics like the scholar and priest Lorenzo Valla, who exposed as a forgery the Donation of Constantine, a central  ancient  document used to support papal claims to earthly dominion, Jesus  claim in John 18:36 was crucial counter-evidence. So too was it for Dante and Marsilius of Padua, who used Jesus  renunciation to critique the papacy s  perverse desire for government . Rather than arguing for theocracy, these Christian intellectuals used the trial of Jesus to advance the cause of secular authority. By tracing these lines of thought, the book argues that the New Testament contains statements that seem to define a sphere of authority that we would recognise as  secular . Secular rule was certainly not a common feature of ancient states, where politics and religion   what Dusenbury calls a  temple-state    were normally indivisible, and while the word  secular  would not gain its modern sense for more than 1,000 years, the use by early Christians of the concept of the  saeculum  as a legitimate temporal realm separate from the eternal kingdom of God would seem to mark something revolutionary. The powerful image of Jesus renouncing any claim to rule in  this world  helps to explain why some writers that we would normally associate with the secular, such as Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, emerge as inordinately interested in the Pilate trial. These deliberations might seem very far from our own experiences of secularity. Like democracy, we tend to take it for granted as a natural state of affairs. The paradox, according to this book, is that the secular is in large part the offspring of theological argument and, without Jesus  confession before Pontius Pilate, we cannot know how our notions of secularity and tolerance might have developed.

            "target_summary": "In *The Innocence of Pontius Pilate*, David Lloyd Dusenbury offers a startlingly original argument that the very concept of a European secular society, marked by the separation of politics and religion, finds its roots in a specific thread of Christian thought. The book meticulously traces this lineage back to the Gospel accounts of Jesus's trial before Pontius Pilate, and the subsequent, centuries-long theological debates over Pilate's culpability in ordering \"the death of God.\"\n\nDusenbury delves not into the historical facts of the trial itself, but rather explores the rich intellectual traditions that grappled with questions of who condemned Jesus, and on what grounds. Central to his thesis is the nuanced understanding of Pilate's 'innocence': he acted as a representative of secular power, fulfilling his temporal duty by ordering the execution, yet was simultaneously ignorant of Jesus's divine nature, thus innocent of deicide. This pivotal distinction is illuminated by Jesus's profound declaration in John 18:36: \"My kingdom is not of this world.\" This renunciation of earthly dominion, the book argues, had significant political ramifications throughout late antiquity and the medieval period.\n\nSt. Augustine's influential reading of the trial emerges as an early \"manifesto\" for dividing the sacred from the *saeculum*, or the temporal realm. For Augustine, Pilate's justice, though imperfect compared to God's, represented a legitimate worldly authority. This conceptual partition, establishing a realm of imperfect, coercive human law alongside an eternal one based on persuasive religious truth, fundamentally gave rise to the idea of the secular.\n\nPractically, this division allowed the Church to assert its spiritual authority without directly challenging temporal rulers. While early figures like Pope Gelasius I championed this separation, later papal claims to worldly power throughout the Middle Ages prompted fierce critique. Christian intellectuals such as Lorenzo Valla, Dante, and Marsilius of Padua, far from advocating theocracy, wielded Jesus's renunciation of earthly power to argue for distinct secular authority, thereby challenging the papacy's temporal ambitions.\n\nThe book contends that the early Christian adoption of the *saeculum* as a legitimate, separate sphere from God's eternal kingdom was revolutionary in a world of \"temple-states\" where politics and religion were indivisible. Dusenbury reveals the profound paradox that our modern, often taken-for-granted notions of secularity and tolerance are, in large part, the unexpected offspring of complex theological arguments, inextricably linked to Jesus's confession before Pontius Pilate.",

            "title": "Disputing Disaster  by Perry Anderson review",
            "content": "Disputing Disaster is a book about the First World War s origins and causes, not   as its title suggests   the war itself. It discusses six historians who have written on a century-old debate that has swung from an acceptance of German war guilt (as stated in the Paris Peace Agreement in 1919) to sharing responsibility among all the players. Today the scholarly needle, as in the early 1930s, points more to the latter conclusion than the former. Perry Anderson s own position prioritises the systemic origins over the proximate and contingent causes of the July 1914 crisis. He aligns the war s outbreak with the collapse of the Concert of Europe   confirmed by Austria-Hungary s decision to abandon a system which had served it well since 1815   and the emergence of  new  imperialism after 1885. Austria-Hungary was not party to this late flowering of empire and its use of war overseas, neither was Germany, but the Entente powers of Britain, France, Russia, and, ultimately, Italy were, with consequences which from 1909 were visited on Europe via the Balkans. Perversely, the historian of Anderson s six who best encapsulates this argument is not known primarily for his work on the Great War. In his magisterial book on European international relations between 1763 and 1848 Paul Schroeder identified the moment in 1815 when the great powers (and Schroeder argued lesser ones too, though Anderson disagrees), fearing that war might trigger revolution, prioritised peace and so created an international order. Anderson s sextet is so diverse, and his treatment of each historian so different, that it is hard to find consistency between them. The repeated refrains   that the July crisis is itself an insufficient explanation for the war, that the long-term origins matter as much as the causes   have been the stuff of debate since the 1920s when German historians responded to the war guilt charge by releasing documents that appeared to situate the beginning of the story with Germany s unification in 1871. To cover this opening period, Anderson begins with Pierre Renouvin, a historian who, as well as being himself a mutil  de guerre, occupied the high ground in French scholarship on the war until his death in 1974. The chapter puts Renouvin in context, by incorporating not just his French contemporaries but also the Americans Sidney Fay and Bernadotte Schmitt who, in 1928 and 1930, wrote the first major works addressing the war s causes in comparative terms. Fay argued that the system had failed and that responsibility was therefore shared. Renouvin disagreed: Germany was guilty because of its decisions in 1914. Anderson s discussion of this historiographical phase is rewarding but it will be hard going for the lay reader: it takes unfamiliar names for granted and gives no account of the war s outbreak. That does not come until the chapter on Christopher Clark s The Sleepwalkers. Luigi Albertini, the author of the three-volume standard work on July 1914, follows Renouvin. Anderson provides a full account of the failure of Italian liberalism before and after the war to explain Albertini s role, as the editor of the Corriere della Sera, in supporting the war and Mussolini s rise to power. Bizarrely, he says less about Albertini s book, the product of his enforced retirement after 1925, or its eventual impact after the Second World War. Anderson s concern with the inherent conservatism of both Renouvin and Albertini finds its fullest flowering in his third case study. Fritz Fischer s two books on German aims during and before the war, published in 1961 and 1969, reignited the debate around German war guilt. They did so by discounting the actions of the other powers and by using fresh evidence in ways that were selective. Anderson is inclined to forgive Fischer because in the process he contributed to Germany s wider liberalisation. However, he is less interested in the furore Fischer provoked (and in who supported him) than in Fischer s credentials as a Nazi and the reasons he changed his political views after the Second World War. Keith Wilson, Anderson s fourth subject, never published his doctoral thesis and is best known for a brief book of essays, The Policy of the Entente, which for all their individual excellence lack an overarching argument and focus entirely on Britain. Although Anderson makes the case for Wilson as a scholar with a broader international perspective, the chapter fails to locate Wilson s output sufficiently in the work of others. Finally we come to Clark and Schroeder. Their chapters are the longest, largely because they are the most discursive: that on Clark gives equal treatment to his most recent book, on the 1848 revolutions; that on Schroeder devotes space to his critique of US foreign policy after 9/11 (another moment when a great power ruptured the order on which it relied). They have two other features in common. Both historians took the focus away from Germany to Austria-Hungary and the Balkans. In this they were anticipated by a historian whom Anderson does not mention. Samuel Williamson s first book, on Anglo-French strategic relations between 1904 and 1914, published in 1969, addressed issues directly relevant to the discussion of Keith Wilson, but it was his book on Austria-Hungary and the war s origins which most effectively shifted the focus of the debate away from Fischer s fixation with Germany. The dual monarchy was the first power to decide on war and it did so because the current system no longer guaranteed its security in the Balkans. Williamson s absence from Disputing Disaster is regrettable. Both Clark and Schroeder also sought to make what they wrote relevant to international relations theory. Clark did so in ways which, as Anderson says, were anachronistic. Schroeder s engagement with theory was much more sophisticated and sustained. The irony is that neither has had much impact on international relations theory, which takes the outbreak of the First World War as a case study of war s origins but remains stubbornly wedded to the Fischer thesis. The 1914 debate has become a case study of disciplinary division, not fusion.

            "target_summary": "Perry Anderson's \"Disputing Disaster\" offers a discerning exploration of the First World War's intricate origins and causes, moving beyond the conflict itself to engage with a century-old scholarly debate. The book meticulously charts the evolution of thought from initial assertions of German war guilt to the prevailing contemporary view of shared responsibility among European powers. Anderson himself champions a systemic understanding, attributing the war's outbreak to the collapse of the Concert of Europe – marked by Austria-Hungary's abandonment of the established order – and the rise of a \"new\" imperialism after 1885, largely driven by the Entente powers and impacting the Continent through the Balkans.\n\nThe core of \"Disputing Disaster\" resides in Anderson's examination of six pivotal historians who have shaped this discourse. Despite the diversity of his chosen sextet and varied treatment of each, a consistent thread emerges: the July 1914 crisis alone is deemed an insufficient explanation, and long-term historical forces are given paramount importance – a perspective that has fueled debate since German historians first challenged war guilt in the 1920s.\n\nThe journey begins with Pierre Renouvin, a towering figure in French scholarship, whose firm belief in Germany's 1914 culpability is juxtaposed with American counterparts like Sidney Fay, who advocated for shared responsibility due to systemic failure. Anderson's discussion of this early historiographical phase, while rich, demands familiarity from the lay reader, reserving details of the war's outbreak for later. Luigi Albertini, author of a seminal three-volume work on July 1914, is notably discussed more for his role in Italian liberalism and support for Mussolini than for the enduring impact of his scholarship, with Anderson perceiving a shared conservatism between him and Renouvin.\n\nThe narrative intensifies with Fritz Fischer, whose 1960s works controversially reignited the German war guilt debate, though Anderson critiques his selective use of evidence while crediting him with contributing to Germany's liberalisation. Anderson, however, focuses more on Fischer's Nazi past and subsequent ideological shift than on the academic firestorm he provoked. Keith Wilson, Anderson's fourth subject, is presented as a scholar with broader international perspective despite his British-centric published works.\n\nThe most expansive chapters are dedicated to Christopher Clark and Paul Schroeder, celebrated for reorienting the analytical lens from Germany towards Austria-Hungary and the Balkans – an intellectual shift regrettably anticipated but uncredited by Anderson to Samuel Williamson. Both Clark and Schroeder also endeavored to link their historical analyses with international relations theory; yet, their efforts, particularly Clark's anachronistic approach, yielded limited impact. The reviewer notes the irony that IR theory, despite embracing WWI as a prime case study, remains stubbornly wedded to the Fischer thesis, highlighting a persistent disciplinary schism rather than integration. Ultimately, Anderson's \"Disputing Disaster\" offers a profound, if occasionally challenging, historiographical journey through the enduring complexities of the Great War's genesis.",

            "content": "With biographies of all the big-name poets of the Great War (with the exception of Wilfred Owen) to her name, Jean Moorcroft Wilson has established herself as the foremost authority on a subject that increasingly informs the way Britain s public views the conflict as a whole. Seeing the war through the prism of these writers of pity and protest may be a distorting mirror, but given the increasingly pacific nature of our society, the view of the war poets may come to be posterity s settled verdict on the struggle. With this weighty volume, which covers Graves  early life, his war experiences and the troubled postwar decade that led up to the publication of his autobiography, Goodbye to All That   hastily written as a money-making potboiler, but now probably the best-known account by a frontline officer   Wilson has again chalked up a formidable achievement. Her special gift is to integrate a penetrating critique of the poetry into her narrative of the life that gave birth to it. In Graves  case this is particularly important as he first suppressed, then neglected the poems he wrote in the trenches, feeling that they were not worthy of his later elevated bardic view of his muse. In fact, many of the poems rediscovered by Wilson are not bad at all and she does Graves  reputation a favour by resurrecting them. Born in the London suburb of Wimbledon to an elderly Irish father and a German mother, Graves grew up in an intellectual atmosphere, amid a tribe of siblings. Bullied at his public school, Charterhouse, he reacted by becoming a boxer and fighting back. About to go up to Oxford, the outbreak of war found him at his family s holiday home in Harlech, North Wales. He enlisted immediately in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Wilson   unafraid to criticise her subject   makes it very clear that Graves was an unpopular officer. His slovenly, individualistic ways defied the army s attempt to force him into a conformist mould. Salvation came in the form of his friendship with Siegfried Sassoon, when his fellow poet joined the same regiment. Though they later fell out over the fibs and inaccuracies in Graves  memoirs, the relationship was crucial to both men, not least when Graves defended his friend after Sassoon protested against the war. Desperately wounded on the Somme, Graves ended the war a nervous and physical wreck. His first marriage ended when he fell under the spell of the poet and essayist Laura Riding. By then he had found his true metier: as a poet. Graves  eventful life and colourful personality has attracted several biographers. Wilson pays him the compliment of treating him as a son, brother, lover, soldier and war victim, but above all as one of Britain s greatest modern writers.

            "target_summary": "Jean Moorcroft Wilson has firmly established herself as the foremost authority on Great War poets, profoundly influencing Britain's understanding of the conflict. Her latest substantial biography, a 'weighty volume' on Robert Graves, proves another formidable achievement, masterfully weaving penetrating critiques of his poetry into the fabric of his life story. This approach is particularly insightful for Graves, who initially suppressed and later neglected his trench poems; Wilson meticulously resurrects these works, enhancing his literary legacy.\n\nThe narrative vividly traces Graves's intellectual London upbringing, his challenging school years at Charterhouse where he cultivated a fighting spirit, and his immediate enlistment in the Royal Welch Fusiliers at the outbreak of WWI. Wilson candidly portrays him as an unpopular, individualistic officer, whose salvation came through his crucial friendship with fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon – a bond so strong Graves staunchly defended Sassoon's anti-war stance. Desperately wounded on the Somme, Graves emerged from the war a nervous and physical wreck. The book further explores his troubled postwar decade, including the end of his first marriage and his influential relationship with Laura Riding, through which he finally embraced his true calling as a poet. Wilson highlights his autobiography, *Goodbye to All That* – originally a 'money-making potboiler' – as now arguably the definitive account by a frontline officer. Ultimately, Wilson honours Graves not only as a complex son, brother, lover, soldier, and war victim, but as one of Britain's greatest modern writers.",

On one level, this makes sense.

Over the last four years, however, it has been easy to forget that this was not a war in which there were no victors.

            "content": "The Seventh Dragoon Guards made one of the last charges of the First World War at 10.30am on 11 November 1918, galloping forward and capturing the bridge at Lessines in the Picardy region of Belgium. Fighting officially ended at 11am on the same day, when the Armistice was signed. On hearing the news, the Fifth Dragoon Guards  official war diary described the celebration as the regiment prepared for a  triumphal march into Germany . While the official diary could easily be written in a celebratory tone, this was not necessarily representative of the feelings that other diaries captured. The war diary of the First West Yorkshire Regiment, for example, wrote that  the news was taken very quietly . Back home, newspapers celebrated and reported that women and children were on the streets flying flags, but news of peace was often met by serving troops with quiet reflection and thanksgiving. As we look back now, over the century since the end of the war, it becomes apparent that reactions to the Armistice have changed to fit in with distinct attitudes towards the war and the years that followed it, which echoed the mood of the nation. Using the personal testimonies, diaries and memoirs of the men who served, we can see the varied reactions of soldiers to news of the Armistice, how they chose to observe the occasion and what happened when they arrived back in Britain and returned to civilian life. Deafening silence Scholars have studied personal testimonies and diaries in order to understand the social aspects of the First World War. Soldiers  responses to the Armistice itself, however, were often muted and sometimes missing from the accounts altogether. Jay Winter and Michael Roper are historians who have remarked on a silence surrounding the war from veterans who returned; servicemen s reactions to the Armistice are no exception. Captain Herman Marsden s memoirs, finally typed up in 1976, contain an interesting discussion of his reasons for not talking about the First World War on his return; he did not want to upset families who had lost loved ones and re-open old wounds by indulging in his memories. He explains:  The fear of causing pain to others was perhaps a reason for my reluctance to recall experiences of World War 1914-1918.  Marsden had been seriously wounded and sent back to England on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Somme and the bloodiest in the British army s history. While many of his colleagues were killed that day, Marsden recovered and was returned to the front lines to fight again before the war was over. In his memoirs he describes his emotions on the day of the Armistice: On the 11th November 1918 there was the Armistice. It was almost unbelievable that there was no longer a world war in progress, and Armistice Day passed by unnoticed, without rejoicing or celebration of any kind. There was not even the slightest sense of relief, but for the survivors there were sad and morbid memories of former colleagues and contemporaries. There was, for me of course, bewilderment and wonder about my survival. Indeed an Armistice to end the World War seemed too great a happening for an ordinary mortal to appreciate fully. Order of Battle on Western Front, 11 A.M Nov 11, 1918. Library of Congress. Public Domain. Although written almost 60 years after the events, Marsden s memoirs reflect perfectly the popular and widespread feeling of the anti-war sentiment of the late 1920s and 1930s. In his memoir, Goodbye To All That, the poet Robert Graves similarly commented: In November came the Armistice. I heard at the same time of the deaths of Frank Jones Bateman, who had gone back again just before the end and Wilfred Owen who often used to send me poems from France. Armistice night hysteria did not touch our camp much, though some of the Canadians stationed there were sent down to Rhyll to celebrate in true overseas style. The news sent me out walking alone above the marshes of Rhuddlen cursing and sobbing and thinking of the dead. Graves was a Captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, who experienced trench warfare. His memoirs were first published in 1929. In many ways, his experiences were similar to Marsden s   both were injured in the Battle of the Somme and recovered from their wounds and returned to the trenches. It is also interesting that Graves  memoir was written around the time of the  peak  in the publishing and consumption of war books and memoirs. Erich Maria Remarque s All Quiet on the Western Front, Ernest Hemingway s A Farewell to Arms, R.C. Sherriff s Journey s End and Richard Aldington s Death of a Hero all emerged in 1929, alongside Goodbye To All That. While the writings of Marsden and Graves are similar, it is important to remember that they were both written a considerable time after the Armistice and both may have had a multitude of reasons for revising what they had felt initially. Did their timely and considered memoirs reflect how men actually felt in November 1918 itself? Goodbye to all that The truth is that it is difficult to know. Not many diaries mention the Armistice. Those written at the time are much more difficult to find and interpret than memoirs written in the late 1920s and after. Many men stopped writing before 11 November 1918; others simply noted that there had been an armistice. The war diary of Chaplain Reverend J.A. Herbert Bell, for example, simply commented:  In the afternoon a wire came through officially that hostilities had ceased at 11am today.  The diary offers no other comment nor any hint of response or emotion. Frustratingly, this is typical of the diaries written during this time. A few did, however, leave clues as to their thoughts and feelings at the outbreak of peace. For many servicemen an end to the war was something that they had been dreaming of for years, but it also brought something uncertain, that was beyond the power of comprehension. The omnipresence of death is a recurring theme in the war diary of Private Thomas Reginald Warner of the West Yorkshire Regiment. Even at the beginning of his war diary, on his first posting to France, Warner was counting the death toll and wondering how long the war would last: Standing apart, down the road that leads north about a mile from the camp is a great graveyard, running right down to the sandy shore. There the little wooden crosses, all alike in form, stand in row upon row, with the sea as a royal blue background. A lovely sight, but a sad one; I wonder how much longer it will be before this sad job is over. Diary entry for 11 November 1918, by Canadian serviceman Louis Llewyllen Lent. Provincial Archives of Alberta. Public Domain. Warner s reflections remained much the same at the end of the war. If anything, the longevity of the conflict only helped to reinforce its seemingly everlasting nature. On 29 June 1918, Warner recorded in his dairy: I wonder how long it will last now? I understand that the Germans have made their last effort and failed. It is rumoured that we shall make an offensive and drive them right back. I wonder when, and if we can. This extract highlights an uncertainty and a weariness about winning the war. While it is not pessimistic, it shows the hearsay and rumour prevalent in the trenches, which may have affected people s experience of the Armistice. For others who served, it is clear that there was a strange, melancholic atmosphere regarding the end of the war. For many soldiers, conflict had become a way of life, a place where they had carved out friendships, tested their resilience and led exciting and worthwhile lives. In complete contrast to the anti-war memoirs of both Marsden and Graves, one soldier, Richard Enden, recalled: There wasn t any real excitement or jubilation at the news [of the Armistice]; naturally we were relieved and I m sure that a weight was lifted from our shoulders, but that was all. The war that everyone hoped would end had ended, but so too had a way of life. Writing of the monumentality of the moment in history, Enden also noted:  It seems funny now to think of the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, in fact many men did not know what the day was. Most were concerned to live only day by day.  Mixed feelings Even away from the front lines, experiences of Armistice Day were not always jubilant. Held in his prison barracks, Cecil Slack remembered the moment of the announcement: As soon as the Armistice was declared, we ceased to answer the bugle call for parade in the barrack square. This caused considerable stamping of feet and angry remarks from our captors   We indicated that as the war was over we should no longer be treated as prisoners. For Slack, the signing of the Armistice quickly and materially changed his circumstances; despite being a prisoner of war, he was also a victor who knew that his imprisonment was now only temporary. A German soldier learns of the Armistice at a POW camp in England, November 1918. Library of Congress. Public Domain. The letters of Arthur George Wilson tell a different story. On his last day of leave on 11 November 1918, Arthur was heading from his home city of York to London to return to his battalion the following day: All London streets are packed. Flags [are] out everywhere. We walked down The Mall to join crowds outside Buckingham Palace. I have never seen such excitement. It is not obvious that he shared the crowd s feelings of excitement. Nevertheless, the fact that he joined in suggests that he was at the very least taken along. The knowledge that he had to return to his regiment may well have muted his reaction. The diary of another private from the West Yorkshire Regiment similarly concluded:  When the Colonel announced that the war was over, we all cheered, but our work was not over. Our next duty was to march to Germany.  Although he was one of the lucky ones, the private was not actually demobilised until the second week of March 1919, five months after Armistice Day. For others, demobilisation was an even longer process. In reality, many soldiers knew that the Armistice did not signal much immediate change in their circumstances, even though hostilities had officially ended. Enden, for example, wrote how feelings of insecurity continued, as men remained on the frontlines, surrounded by the reminders of war:  For the next three or four days a phoney war continued with occasional gunfire and now and again the explosion of a delayed mine.  For many, the prospect of a homecoming remained a distant reality and the process of coming home could feel very slow and protracted. It is possible, too, that the difficult conditions awaiting servicemen in Britain after the Armistice can account for some of the anti-war sentiment of the memoirs written in the late 1920s and 1930s. Homecomings The government feared the return of too many unemployed servicemen too quickly. Despite legislation ensuring that ex-servicemen would return to employment, it did not always happen. The economic depression of the interwar years did little to help relieve the problems of unemployment; those who returned home had to compete in a desperately competitive labour market. Marsden offers an insight into the problems faced by such men. His memoirs are both unusual and illuminating for the detail in which he depicts his postwar life, describing his somewhat unsuccessful attempts at finding a job and returning to normality: A satisfactory military career with a Military Cross and a highly prized  mentioned in despatches , quite correctly had not the slightest value as assets in obtaining employment with cash wherewithal on which to live. Indeed, experiences as a temporary officer was, in many respects, a definite handicap. He recalled that  I was a raw recruit, a veritable  rookie  in a fiercely competitive civilian army.  The government tried a range of tactics, including forcing women out of the workplace, to try to rectify the problem of unemployment among ex-servicemen. Demobilised soldiers received papers to document who they were and where they had been, including any suitable training they had received while in the military. Despite such schemes, however, many men struggled and they, like Marsden, often felt that they had missed out on opportunities, only for others to reap the benefits of their absence. For these men, returning home to a land fit for heroes seemed a mockery. Going to war had meant losing out on more valuable civilian experiences. The Armistice merely signalled the return home to another fight. Unfit for work Despite the levels of unemployment, it must be remembered that these were the lucky ones, who were fortunate that employment was still a valid option. For other soldiers, physical and mental disabilities were the lasting legacies from the war. Over its course, around two million British men suffered from disabling wounds, but survived to go back to civilian life. In 1917 a specialist body was set up to look after all the disabled and seriously wounded servicemen: the Ministry of Pensions. One of its tasks was to pay for the treatment and the pensions of men who had received either lifelong or long-term injuries because of their war service. At its peak, in 1920, there were 1,600,000 ex-servicemen receiving pensions or other forms of aid. Support was offered for those deemed to be both totally and  partially  disabled. Pensions were granted on a sliding scale, depending on how disabled the recipient was judged to be. A serviceman who was considered to be fully disabled and completely incapable of work was assessed at 100 per cent. Private John Cook of the East Yorkshire Regiment was discharged from the army on 22 September 1916 as unfit for military service, having received a bullet wound to the skull. Before the war, Cook had been a joiner, but his injuries meant there was little chance that he could return to that. His disability was assessed at 90 per cent and he was granted a pension for life. He received 32 shillings a week for himself and a 14 shillings a week allowance for his wife and child, until his death in 1950. Other soldiers had a harder time proving their ailments and afflictions. Private Joe Bradley was only awarded a pension of five shillings and 10 pence a week for a period of 12 months for trench fever. His disability was assessed at 20 per cent and the money that he received also included an allowance for his wife and child. Like many others, even this was stopped in 1920 as the government tried to ease the financial burden of costly pensions. The great victory parade passes Buckingham Palace, 5 December 1918. Library of Congress. Public Domain. The responsibility of providing proof proved too difficult for some servicemen, who were denied a pension for their disability. Private Sydney Round served as a driver for the Royal Army Engineering Corps. He was in Gallipoli, Egypt and France after 1916. He applied to the Ministry of Pensions for defective eyesight in the right eye after being gassed. His request was rejected as it was considered to be  not aggravated by the war . Round had to look after himself, without any government aid. Other men were disabled through paralysing mental conditions. While many who were diagnosed as  shell-shocked  recovered quickly from their ailments, others  mental afflictions were prolonged and some would never recover. Thomas Olive explained how his wartime experiences manifested themselves once back in civilian life: I used to have little breakdowns now and then and my wife used to be very frightened. It more or less used to happen at night, when I was in bed. My daughter, incidentally, is terribly nervous. My wife says it s all my fault. Well I had shell shock, you see. I got blown up and it affected my whole system. Patients who had not recovered from their trauma could find themselves admitted to local lunatic asylums, as they were then still called. In many instances, the public were scandalised by this and the government set up a scheme in which ex-servicemen were entitled to a small pension and a separate uniform to mark them out from  pauper lunatics . On 1 January 1920, less than three years after the scheme was proposed, there were already 3,739 patients classed as service patients in institutions in England and Wales. Ten years later that number had risen to 4,618. For many of these institutionalised men, the Armistice meant nothing at all. Many lived on for decades, fighting a war that would never end. The valiant dead It seems clear that a serviceman s experiences of the conflict would have influenced his response to the Armistice, depending on whether he was physically or mentally disabled, or was still fighting when peace was announced. It is also important to remember that these reactions were likely to change over time, as attitudes and situations changed, and are subtly different in memoirs, often written years after the conflict, from those in contemporary diaries, written in the heat of battle. As the years passed, Armistice Day became less of an occasion for the living. By the 1920s and 1930s, commemoration had become more about remembering the valiant dead rather than the inconvenient unemployed ex-servicemen, or those who were simply trying to live with their physical and mental injuries with only a meagre pension allowance from the state. A century on, if interest in the First World War begins to wane after the centenary of the Armistice in November 2018, we would be echoing the reactions of 100 years ago, forgetting the plight of those who returned to bear the scar of war until their deaths, whenever that might have been.

            "target_summary": "The First World War’s thunderous end arrived with a stark paradox on November 11, 1918. Even as the official Armistice was hours away, the Seventh Dragoon Guards made one of the conflict's last charges, capturing a bridge at Lessines. While official war diaries optimistically spoke of triumphal marches into Germany and newspapers at home erupted in jubilant celebration, the news of peace was often met with a far more complex, frequently muted, emotional landscape among the serving troops themselves.\n\nMany contemporary military diaries, surprisingly, offered little more than a factual note of the cessation of hostilities, devoid of the expected elation. The First West Yorkshire Regiment, for instance, recorded the news as being \"taken very quietly.\" This quietude stemmed from years of weary endurance, the omnipresent shadow of death, and a pervasive uncertainty about the future. For soldiers like Private Thomas Reginald Warner, the war's seemingly endless nature had ingrained a day-by-day existence, making the Armistice almost incomprehensible. Richard Enden similarly recalled relief, but \"no real excitement or jubilation,\" recognizing that an entire way of life had ended.\n\nThis initial quiet often evolved into a profound \"silence\" among returning veterans, a phenomenon noted by historians. Later memoirs, penned decades after the conflict, often painted a more somber picture. Captain Herman Marsden, in his 1976 memoirs, described Armistice Day as passing \"unnoticed, without rejoicing or celebration,\" leaving only \"sad and morbid memories\" for survivors. Poet Robert Graves, in his 1929 \"Goodbye To All That,\" recounted cursing and sobbing over lost friends rather than celebrating. These powerful, reflective accounts, often mirroring the burgeoning anti-war sentiment of the 1920s and 30s, acknowledged the passage of time had shaped their understanding, yet deeply conveyed the psychological toll of war.\n\nFor countless soldiers, the Armistice did not signal an immediate end to hardship. Demobilization was a slow, often frustrating process, with many remaining on the front lines amidst lingering dangers, or marching into Germany for months. The grand promise of a \"land fit for heroes\" frequently dissolved into the grim reality of a post-war Britain grappling with economic depression and widespread unemployment. Veterans, despite their valor and military honours, often found their wartime experiences a \"definite handicap\" in the fiercely competitive civilian job market, as Marsden vividly recounted.\n\nFurthermore, millions bore the indelible physical and mental scars of the conflict. The Ministry of Pensions provided some aid, yet support was often insufficient or hard-won. While some, like Private John Cook, received lifelong pensions for severe injuries, others, like Private Joe Bradley for trench fever, were granted only temporary, meagre sums, or, like Private Sydney Round, were outright denied, their ailments deemed \"not aggravated by the war.\" The devastating psychological trauma of \"shell shock\" left many with \"little breakdowns,\" affecting entire families and, in severe cases, leading to institutionalization in \"lunatic asylums\" for decades. For these institutionalized men, the Armistice meant tragically little, as they continued to fight a war that would never truly end.\n\nAs the years passed, public commemoration of Armistice Day subtly shifted. While initial reactions from veterans highlighted a complex array of emotions, the focus gradually moved from the inconvenient plight of living, often struggling, ex-servicemen to the revered memory of the \"valiant dead.\" A century on, it remains vital to remember the full spectrum of experiences surrounding the Armistice and the enduring, profound legacy of the war on those who survived to carry its scars.",

            "title": "The Catastrophe at Caporetto",
            "content": "When Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915, it did so fuelled by optimistic visions of territorial conquest. It hoped to seize the largely Italian-speaking regions around Trento and Trieste at the country s north-east border. Nationalist rhetoric held that acquisition of these areas   along with parts of Dalmatia   would complete the process of unification which had taken place in the second half of the 19th century.  Italians want a greater Italy, by conquest not by purchase, not shamefully but through blood and glory , proclaimed the firebrand poet Gabriele D Annunzio. By late 1917, however, fatigue had set in even among the war s supporters. Little apparent progress had been made on any front, casualties were high and the country s economy was suffering badly. Soldiers in the Italian army hoped that the winter of 1917 would offer some respite. It did not. As rumours of an imminent Austro-Hungarian attack circulated, the Italian army sought to reinforce the mountainous north-eastern battle lines around the town of Caporetto (today Kobarid in Slovenia). The town was positioned on the western side of the Isonzo River, which had partially formed the boundary between Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the war. By October 1917, the front lines ran some six or seven miles east of the river, along the heights of mounts Ursig, Nero and Rosso. Caporetto had been selected by the Central Powers as the target for a major offensive because of the weakness of the Italian defence there. When the expected offensive was launched on 24 October, the resulting battle lasted over a month and was a disaster tantamount to a national trauma. We can witness its opening stage through the eyes of Colonel Francesco Pisani who, as acting general of the Foggia Brigade, found himself and his division part of the Italian drive for reinforcement when he was ordered to Caporetto on 23 October 1917. His brigade had been involved in heavy fighting during the summer in the successful conquest of the Bainsizza plateau, and was now in a state of disarray. He hoped Caporetto would be a quiet posting. The units under his command were struggling with large numbers of green, poorly trained soldiers. Pisani led his men towards divisional headquarters at Caporetto overnight through torrential rain and thick fog. They had barely reached the front-line in the early hours of 24 October when an intense enemy bombardment began along the entire north-eastern line. At dawn, though Pisani and his men did not know it, nine Austro-Hungarian and six German divisions under Otto von Below had launched a major offensive. Germany had agreed to support its ally in what was hoped would be a decisive attack on Italy before winter made campaigning impossible. Domestic tensions in Austria-Hungary, caused by the growing desire for autonomy among the empire s many nationalities, made it imperative to seek victory as quickly as possible. The Central Powers  plan was to smash through the Italian lines, advancing through the valleys to isolate and encircle the Italian defenders who were holding the high ground, before pushing on westward towards the rivers and plains of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia. The Foggia Brigade were advancing directly towards the focal point of this attack. As the morning wore on, orders arrived from divisional headquarters redirecting most of the Foggia Brigade s battalions to other nearby destinations where they would reinforce other units struggling under the Central Powers  assault. As the remaining members of the brigade moved towards Caporetto, they began to encounter large numbers of troops retreating down the same narrow mountain road that they were ascending, bringing with them terrible stories about the fighting ahead. After reaching divisional HQ at Caporetto, Pisani and his men were sent to defend the vital Eiffel Bridge. This was one of the few crossings over the fast-flowing Isonzo, which lay in a deep gorge. If the bridge were lost, several Italian divisions on the east bank of the river and on the mountain slopes above it would be entirely cut off. As German units infiltrated the area, encircling the high peaks of Mount Nero and Rosso up ahead, large numbers of Italian troops were seeking to retreat to the relative safety of the west bank and of Caporetto itself. Without the Eiffel Bridge, this evacuation would be impossible. The divisional commander had ordered a general retreat and abandoned control of the town to the Foggia Brigade. Pisani later described his task in his official post-battle debriefing: There was total confusion, the road was almost entirely blocked by a mass of troops, carts, horses, trucks, artillery pieces, mules, and supplies. Officers' cars were unable to make any headway, and it was very hard to execute or even transmit any orders. At this point, the various components of the Brigade became separated, in the chaos, the freezing fog and the rain. We also tried to organise transport for the wounded, many of who had been abandoned in the road. We could hear them groaning through the fog, and it was imperative to move them since their presence was demoralising the defenders of the bridge. By mid-afternoon, Italian army headquarters in Udine, some 25 miles away, were still in complete ignorance of the scale of events. Not until 10pm would Chief of General Staff Luigi Cadorna learn the true dimensions of what the Italian troops were suffering at the country s north-eastern boundary. The situation was a catalogue of woe: indecisive senior commanders, munitions shortages, information blackouts, missing officers and communication breakdowns all worked against a few desperately stretched individuals doing their best to contain the German assault under driving rain and freezing fog. At around 3pm on 24 October, Italian engineers blew up the Eiffel Bridge that the Foggia Brigade was supposed to be defending. At least two Italian divisions were trapped on the eastern side of the river, their retreat cut off. Pisani described the scene: There was no immediate command in the town of Caporetto itself. The order to destroy the bridge must have been given by a senior officer   but when? Perhaps it had been issued in an uncertain and unclear fashion. I concluded that the decision must have been based on the supposition that the enemy was still on the east bank of the Isonzo   but this was not at all the case, and given that the Germans had already crossed the river [further to the south], the destruction of the bridge served no useful purpose. I was ordering the rearrangement of our remaining machine gun posts for a better defence of the position, at about 17.00, and my few staff and I were making our way from one post to another when we suddenly found ourselves confronted by a large group of German soldiers. We had no idea the enemy had approached so close. Concealing themselves in one of the half-ruined buildings along the road, they were able to ambush and encircle us easily. Threatening us with rifles and bayonets, the enemy disarmed us so quickly that there was barely time to even think. This was the end of Pisani s war; captured with his staff, he was despatched to a prisoner of war camp at Karlsruhe in Germany. Leaderless and isolated, the Foggia Brigade stood little chance. Most of the patrols Pisani had sent out in search of information had already been surrounded in the fog. By the end of the day 3,577 of its men had been taken prisoner, while the Central Powers had advanced around 14 miles, seizing bridges, and were established on the west bank of the Isonzo. Around 20,000 Italians were captured that day and by the time the battle ended, a month later, more than 280,000 had been taken by the enemy, almost half of all those captured during the war. * The opening phase of the battle, from 24 October to 3 November, was the most damaging to Italy. The chaotic scenes and mass captures that Pisani witnessed were repeated up and down the peaks and valleys of the north-eastern front. As enormous numbers of troops began to retreat, often without munitions and officers, panic set in and a disorderly mass flight began. By 27 October, the Supreme Command was no longer confident that even the  extreme  line of defence, nearly 45 miles away on the river Tagliamento, would be able to hold. This was where Italy s last prepared defensive positions were located, but Chief of General Staff Cadorna began to contemplate a further withdrawal to the river Piave. The next day, he and his staff abandoned their headquarters at Udine and joined the retreat. The first enemy troops reached Udine at around 3pm; it would soon become the new Austro-Hungarian HQ. The retreating Italians reached the Tagliamento on 31 October. By 3 November the enemy, too, had reached this river, as Italian troops fell back towards the Piave, around 100 miles behind the original front. In the first five days of the battle, huge numbers of Italians were captured but as the retreat continued losses were increasingly caused by desertion. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers fled back into Italy from the positions they had conquered in the first two and a half years of the war. Luigi Albertini, editor of the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera, visited the front on 30 October 1917.  For the most part, the troops did not fight. When sent forward they discarded their weapons and returned unarmed , he reported. Many men claimed that they had been told that the war was over, so it was not only permissible but sensible to head home. In total 300,000 men were  scattered  during the battle. It was impossible to say whether they had voluntarily absconded or simply got lost in the chaos of the retreat. * The speed and extent of the Austro-German offensive had taken the Italian forces by surprise, but it was equally unexpected to the attackers themselves. As a result, they struggled to capitalise on their advance. Bringing up fresh troops and keeping their artillery moving forward proved difficult owing to fleeing civilians, broken bridges and disordered roads, which had also delayed the Italian retreat. This gave the Italians time to regroup. In the second phase of the battle, beginning once the Italians had reached the Tagliamento on 3 November, they began to recover their fighting capacity as the demoralised forces were replaced by more solid and resilient troops drawn from the reserves and from the Alpine front in the north, which had been untouched by the Central Powers  attack. The retreat was controlled and disciplined. Gradually the line stabilised, taking up a new defensive position on the Piave on 9 November. The new front, which was maintained until October 1918, was hundreds of kilometres shorter than the original and thus more easily manned. The terrain, too, was more hospitable, allowing for more effective lines of communication. The third and final phase of the battle started on 12 November and lasted for six days. The Austro-German offensive was renewed, with a final push to break through Italian lines towards Venice. British intelligence reported that  Germany and Austria count on the collapse of Italy during the coming winter . But the push was unsuccessful: the Piave line held, with support from French and British forces, who took over their own sections on 21 November. The battle finally ended on 26 November as the new front stabilised. The front line would remain in this position until the final weeks of the war. By the battle s conclusion more than 5,000 square miles of Italian territory was in enemy hands. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of prisoners and dispersed soldiers, the Italian army also lost 40,000 soldiers who were either killed or wounded during the battle. German and Austro-Hungarian casualties numbered 50,000. Over one million civilian refugees had been forced to flee from the advancing Austro-German troops; many more remained trapped in occupied territory, suffering death, sickness and deprivation under Habsburg military rule. Italy s losses were not limited to land and people. The young Lieutenant Erwin Rommel, fighting south of Caporetto with the W rttemberg Mountain battalion, recollected with pleasure the  chocolate, eggs, preserves, grapes and white bread  which his troops seized and which made their morale  wonderful!  Over 10 million ration sets, and more than six million tins of fish or meat, were among the Italian supplies captured by the advancing Central Powers forces, along with 1,309 tonnes of dried pasta, 645 tonnes of cheese and 253 tonnes of coffee. Of even more interest to Rommel s men, perhaps, was their share of the captured wine (five million litres) and cognac (1,600 litres). The Italians also lost significant stores of clothing and bedding: 966,000 coats and waterproofs, 69,000 hats, 320,000 pairs of boots and 1.5 million pairs of pants and socks along with 295,000 sheets and blankets. Engineers lost more than 17,000 tonnes of essential material, while thousands of trucks and tens of thousands of horses and mules   with their fodder   were abandoned to the enemy. Some 3,000 artillery pieces and a similar number of machine guns were lost, which Italy could ill afford given its shortages of these essential weapons. Several field hospitals with all their beds, iodine and medicines were taken. The loss of significant amounts of coal meant that Italy became dependent on imports from its allies. * The consequences of the defeat were dramatic and a great deal of national soul-searching followed with immediate changes at the highest levels. The prime minister, Paolo Boselli, was replaced by the experienced liberal lawyer Vittorio Orlando. Cadorna was forced out. His high-handed, inflexible leadership was unpopular with civilian politicians and his military abilities had been questioned even before the catastrophic events of Caporetto. Orlando did not want to work with him and nor did the Allies, whose representatives arrived in Italy at the end of October. The allies met at Rapallo, near Genoa, on 5 November, with the battle still raging. They agreed to support Italy and created the Supreme War Council (SWC), a kind of allied general staff. This offered an ideal way to remove Cadorna, who was shifted  upwards  into the SWC, and replaced as Chief of the General Staff by Armando Diaz, a younger, more dynamic and tactful general. Diaz would transform the army s training, formation-level tactics, morale, command structures, leave policies and more. Where Cadorna had stifled initiative and confidence   sacking and demoting commanders at the drop of a hat   Diaz was more open to suggestions and to delegation. Cadorna s dismissal suggested that he was responsible for the defeat, but allocation of blame caused a political row, beginning within 48 hours of the initial attack. Concerns about disaffection and defeatism among the troops had been growing. The authorities feared that  subversive  socialist propaganda was destroying the army s fighting spirit. Cadorna was quick to advance this interpretation. On 28 October he had declared that  the inadequate resistance of units of 2nd Army, cowardly retreating without fighting or ignominiously surrendering to the enemy, has permitted the Austro-German forces to break our left wing on the Julian front . This was damaging to the Italian army s image both nationally and internationally. The Italian ambassador to London recalled that even George V made disparaging comments about the Italian troops  performance. Attributing blame for defeat on the soliders was oddly endorsed by elements of both the right   who saw it as proof of socialist-inspired cowardice and pacifism   and the left, who interpreted it as a  military strike , which demonstrated that the masses had turned against the war. In truth, it is unfair to claim that the frontline units who faced the Austro-German assault on 24 October or the days after failed to fight. The Foggia Brigade s experience of conflicting orders, inadequate supplies and unsuitable defensive positioning was representative of the whole. Many reports suggest that the men fought bravely with determination for as long as they had officers and munitions. Once these two essentials were lost it was hard to keep a positive outlook, as a battalion commander from the 224th infantry regiment recalled: On the night of 23 October my men were in good spirits but by the end of the next day they were less confident. By the end of 25 October, the unit had become mixed with others, the men had not slept for 24 hours and had no more munitions. At this stage they became  morally prisoners  and in a state of depression began to accept the prospect of capture and imprisonment. Under these circumstances large groups of men could be captured by small enemy detachments. The Italian army s defence strategy was also responsible for the defeat. Cadorna had decided to hold the mountainous peaks at all costs while neglecting the valleys below; the Germans simply advanced with speed through these valleys, encircling the defenders on the peaks. Caporetto was a devastating military defeat, but it was one with clearly identifiable strategic, operational and tactical causes. * The battle almost immediately assumed the name of the town where the decisive breakthrough had been made and soon became an emblem of Italian military failure. For decades it was associated with anti-war sentiment, desertion and cowardice. The novelist Carlo Emilio Gadda, who was trapped and captured after the premature destruction of the Eiffel Bridge, described his experience as one of  spiritual horrors . In a sense, the whole country reacted this way. Pisani wrote that  the sacrifice of blood made by the regiments could not hope to dam up the invading tide ; that tide swept away two and a half years worth of gains, made at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. Italy s victory in the First World War came in the battle of Vittorio Veneto, symbolically (if coincidentally) launched on 24 October 1918. Yet the scars left by Caporetto were hard to heal. The shadows of those foggy, chaotic days in the mountains loomed large into the postwar years.

            "target_summary": "Italy entered the First World War in May 1915, driven by soaring nationalist aspirations and a fervent belief in territorial expansion. It envisioned completing national unification by seizing Italian-speaking regions from Austria-Hungary, fueling a rhetoric of \"blood and glory.\" However, by late 1917, these optimistic dreams had soured. War fatigue, crippling casualties, economic suffering, and little apparent progress on any front had left the nation profoundly weary.\n\nIt was into this atmosphere of mounting exhaustion that the devastating Battle of Caporetto unfolded. As rumours of an imminent Austro-Hungarian offensive swirled, Italian reinforcements, including Colonel Francesco Pisani's disorganised Foggia Brigade, converged on the mountainous north-eastern front near Caporetto. Pisani, hoping for a quiet posting after brutal summer fighting, instead found his unit filled with inexperienced recruits.\n\nOn the night of October 23, 1917, Pisani led his men through torrential rain and thick fog towards Caporetto, strategically positioned on the Isonzo River. In the early hours of October 24, a ferocious bombardment erupted along the entire line. Unbeknownst to the Italians, fifteen Austro-Hungarian and German divisions, commanded by Otto von Below, had launched a massive, decisive offensive. Their plan was to sweep through the valleys, encircling Italian defenders on the high ground before pushing west. Pisani's brigade found itself advancing directly into the furious epicenter of this assault.\n\nAs the morning wore on, chaos reigned. Pisani's brigade was split and redeployed to bolster crumbling defenses, while terrified Italian troops streamed down the narrow mountain roads, bringing tales of utter devastation. Reaching Caporetto, Pisani was tasked with defending the vital Eiffel Bridge over the fast-flowing Isonzo, the sole escape route for several trapped Italian divisions. The town itself descended into pandemonium, a \"total confusion\" of men, vehicles, and abandoned wounded. Orders were impossible to transmit, and command disintegrated.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, Italian engineers prematurely destroyed the Eiffel Bridge, sealing the fate of at least two divisions still on the eastern bank. Pisani, bewildered by the order given the enemy had already crossed the river further south, was reorganizing his remaining machine gun posts when he and his staff were ambushed and captured by German soldiers who had infiltrated the town undetected. His war was over; the leaderless Foggia Brigade soon succumbed.\n\nThe opening phase of Caporetto, from October 24 to November 3, was a national trauma. The initial collapse led to a disorderly mass flight, with hundreds of thousands of troops retreating, often without munitions or officers. By November 3, Italian forces had fallen back some 100 miles to the Piave River. The sheer speed and scale of the Austro-German advance caught even the attackers by surprise, hindering their ability to consolidate gains. However, the Italian losses were staggering: over 5,000 square miles of territory, more than 280,000 prisoners (almost half of all Italians captured in the war), 40,000 killed or wounded, and vast quantities of essential supplies – from millions of food rations and litres of wine to thousands of artillery pieces and vehicles – were lost or abandoned. Over a million civilians fled their homes.\n\nThe defeat triggered immediate and profound national soul-searching. Prime Minister Boselli and the autocratic Chief of General Staff Luigi Cadorna were swiftly replaced by Vittorio Orlando and the more dynamic Armando Diaz. Cadorna, initially blaming his soldiers for \"cowardly retreating,\" ignited a political storm. However, the true culprits were soon identified: deeply flawed strategic and tactical decisions, such as Cadorna's insistence on holding mountain peaks while neglecting the valleys, coupled with inadequate supplies, poor communication, and utterly disorganized command structures. Frontline units, Pisani's experience showed, often fought bravely until leadership and munitions vanished.\n\nCaporetto became a searing symbol of military failure, associated for decades with defeatism and chaos. Yet, from its ashes, a reformed Italian army under Diaz gradually stabilized the front on the Piave by November 9, eventually holding this line until the war's final weeks. Italy's ultimate victory at Vittorio Veneto, launched ironically on October 24, 1918, could not entirely erase the haunting shadow of Caporetto – a disaster born of shattered hopes and the brutal reality of war.",

            "title": "Desolation Row: Victorian Britain s Sensational Slums",
            "content": "On 2 November 1895, Rosina Meagher, a young Welsh woman, was attacked by her husband. The assault left her seriously injured. Rosina lived in a notorious lane in Newport known as  Quiet Woman s Row , so-called satirically in the local press as a shorthand for the domestic violence   aimed at women   that was seen as typical of slum areas. Coverage of Quiet Woman s Row in the local press   and its gratuitous focus on violence   was typical of the late-Victorian and Edwardian penchant for  slumland storytelling , where sensational coverage of life in the slums that blighted towns and cities across Britain served as a means of arguing for urban redevelopment   and selling newspapers. Several prominent writers wrote about the urban slum during this period, including Jacob Riis, George Sims, Margaret Harkness, Arthur Morrison and Jack London. Slums   the first recorded use of the word is in 1825   were one symptom of the mass growth in population which occurred in the first half of the 19th century. The shift from agricultural to industrial labour saw people move to urban areas where cheap housing, designed to be fairly short-term, was built on land under short leases to accommodate them. Increasingly, a number of families found themselves crammed in, and unsanitary conditions followed. Fact and fiction frequently merged when it came to depicting slum life. The sordid stories became entertainment for readers who enjoyed the tales at a safe distance.  Slum tourism  developed, where members of polite society went to see for themselves what the slums were like. In the 1890s, the press reported that an unnamed young girl from a wealthy background had been reported missing. Detectives eventually located her in a slum dwelling in East London; the girl had been so  enthused  by Walter Besant s All Sorts and Conditions of Men (1882) that she had decided to visit the area to see how the poor really lived. After telling one resident about her rich parents, she had been abducted, in the hope that her father would pay a ransom for her release. Reports of this girl s misadventure neatly reflect the tropes of  slumland storytelling    a term coined by the historian Alan Mayne to describe the way newspapers in this period increasingly reported criminal incidents in the slum in a manner calculated to appeal to their middle-class, literate, readership. The press created melodramatic tales of slum life, stressing the inherent criminality of slum dwellers who were presented as clearly gendered stereotypes. Men were thugs; women were either unfeminine, displaying a lack of mothering instincts towards their children, or innocents who had married and become victims of domestic violence, left cowering in their slums, or desperately seeking to maintain respectability in the face of abject poverty. Children were either feral, running around in the streets with little parental guidance, or   like the women   innocent beings who, if removed from their environment, might thrive. Women were the focus of this style of storytelling, falling into one of two categories: uncouth criminals or submissive sexual victims. And because women were seen as being akin to children, their loss of virtue, or their criminality, was particularly shocking. Slum stories, of course, were written by outsiders and shaped by preconceptions of slum life. In 1894, the Liverpool Mercury reported the graphic yet intimate details of a local magistrate s experiences of the city s slums. Here, a member of the respectable classes had ventured into the dangerous slums to see the residents  lives and had come back to share his exploits with the rest of his class. It was reported that the main features of slum life were  squalor, drunkenness, improvidence, lawlessness, immorality and crime . Such stories made readers feel as though part of their city was like the Wild West. In 1899, the Belfast-based Northern Whig published a large feature that pushed for wholesale slum clearances. Until this happened, it argued, the slum would remain  the same foul, dangerous quarter of obscenity, filth and degradation  where sin, vice and crime were rife. It depicted destitute female residents existing on weak tea and bread, dying mothers unable to feed their babies and children starving and  vermin-swarmed . It eagerly noted how  drunkenness, harlotry, murder and bestiality  were ever-present in areas where distinctions between sexes were  unknown  due to communal living in doss houses, before including a graphic tale of one wife, the victim of domestic violence, cowering from her  sullen, drunken, murderous brute  of a husband, while he ripped her clothing. This sort of gratuitous writing was not confined to newspaper reports; a genre known as  slum fiction  became popular, including well-known titles such as George Gissing s The Nether World and Arthur Morrison s A Child of the Jago as well as the popular  penny dreadfuls . In the reports  detailing of the beaten wife s flushed face, agonised eyes and torn bodice it particularly resembles the latter. There was a clear sexual element to the violence, as the descriptions of bestiality and harlotry suggest. The account certainly emphasised the brutality of slum life, but it also aimed to titillate its readers. In press reports, individual incidents and criminal cases were seen as symptomatic of slum life. Any case that came before the local courts would be pounced on if the parties involved lived in slum areas. The fact of their residence made their lives immediately newsworthy. Such was the case of Rosina Meagher and Quiet Woman s Row. A notorious dockside street in the Pillgwenlly district of Newport, south Wales, the Row had been the subject of an increasing number of newspaper articles in the years before Rosina s case made the news. These had focused primarily on the female residents  tendency towards crime and disorder, despite the fact that the majority of such cases involved petty offences. These included fights over the use of shared washing-lines, arguments over keeping animals in backyards and the theft of coal from the nearby docks. It is true that the verbal and minor assaults frequently involved women, but this is inevitable given that they tended to spend more time at home than their husbands, who worked at the docks. Domestic spaces were cramped and busy, leading to an understandable loss of temper   but motivation and cause were not of interest to the press. From the mid-1870s onwards, newspapers increasingly focused on the  not so quiet women  of Quiet Woman s Row, referring to the lane as  the locality miscalled Quiet Woman s Row  and  that paradox of female Paradise . When Thomas Meagher was tried for the attempted murder of his wife, the case was covered extensively in Wales. There were expos s of Rosina s poverty-stricken life, where  there was not a particle of furniture in the house . Slum women were usually either  untidy women  and inadequate housekeepers, or innocents corrupted by the slum. Rosina was to be the latter, the bourgeois ideal of womanhood; a pretty, golden-haired girl with an alcoholic, abusive husband, who, despite living in a slum street, kept her house and its exterior tidy, so that it  presents a cleaner aspect than others . Rosina Meagher became a slumland sensation. The Evening Express sent a reporter out to investigate the den of iniquity from which she had emerged: Instead of being the quarters of orderly females, it is quite the reverse, and hardly a police-court is held but what some disorderly case is heard from that quarter   Our reporter, who visited it on Saturday morning, says it is a typical abode of the poorest clan of Irish folk. A group of coarse, dirty women stood, with their bare arms akimbo, discussing  the murder , whilst a dozen of half-dressed children were sitting about the road, apparently playing. It was, the report said, a poverty-stricken street with residents who partook in gossip while their children roamed around, neglected. But there was fear, as well as curiosity, in how the case was reported. As a result of the press coverage, slum tourists converged on the Row to see how the poor of their town lived and to see where a woman was nearly murdered. When a case as horrific as the Meagher attack made the pages of the newspapers, there was a desire by those in Newport to distance themselves from the poor in their area. This area of the town was  not to do with them    it was alien, other, separate from, and outside of,  ordinary  society. * Slum stories appeared against the backdrop of major economic and social change. Newspapers were full of reports of houses being bought and sold for some quite considerable sums; but alongside this were stories about houses in Quiet Woman s Row not selling, of short-term leases that resulted in residents frequently moving on and of landlords failing to maintain their properties. No link was made between the high instances of petty crime in the Row and unemployment, low wages or poor living conditions. Yet there were regularly appeals for something to be done about the Row. In 1850, a report into the sanitation of the town had described it in grim terms: damp and filthy, with only one outside privy to serve 14 houses and an ever-present stench due to the existence of an open rubbish pit. Over the next half century, there continued to be problems getting the landlords of these cheaply built houses to accept responsibility for maintaining them. In 1888, the owner of a two-roomed house   let to a family of seven   was called to the police court for allowing the premises  to be in a filthy and overcrowded condition . Residents themselves demonstrated some agency in 1875, organising a petition that was submitted to the council, calling attention to  the closet accommodation to the houses at west end of Quiet Woman s Row, which is a disgrace and a nuisance to the neighbourhood . The following year, one magistrate  made further allusion to the unsatisfactory condition of Quiet Woman s Row  and noted that 68 residents had to share two privies. The owner was served notice to provide four additional closets, although there is no evidence that they did. In 1887, a press report speculating that the Row would be demolished to make way for a new railway and station serving the dockyard made no reference to the impact it would have on residents, but enthused, instead, on the benefit of such plans to the whole borough of Newport. The residents of the Row were living in conditions regarded as among the worst in the area, where the struggle to even get the most basic of amenities took years and where they were seen by the rest of Newport as, essentially, a foreign presence. The focus on criminality in the Row was not entirely unfounded. Some residents did commit offences, which was also the case in many other slum areas. A few of the women in the Row were repeat offenders, but men also appeared in court, often for more serious offences, including severe physical assaults and attempted murders. Many petty offences were understandable given the economic and spatial pressures on residents of both genders; there were fights over shared spaces, an impatience with sharing tiny, unhygienic houses with multiple other occupants, including grown-up children, and financial worries that saw many steal small coal and others unable to pay the required maintenance when their children ended up in the local reformatories. In 1893, a resident called Thomas Flynn told the court he could not pay a fine  because for some time past work had been very dead . But overwhelmingly press coverage focused on the women of the Row. Virtue, once subjected to the realities of the slum, was soon lost. Quiet Woman s Row became shorthand for crime, disorder and filth. It was soon at the forefront of the local press  attempts to see slums swept aside in the name of progress. Newsprint influenced both public opinion and local government policy. By focusing on the crimes rather than their underlying causes and by making the Row a no man s land where fearless investigative reporters volunteered to visit and report on the inhabitants as though they were a foreign tribe, press coverage made the Row appear not a part of Newport   and if it wasn t part of Newport, it shouldn t be there. Soon it wasn t   it was demolished in 1899, and the last reference to it in the press, in 1910, made clear that it was a piece of history deservedly consigned to the past. The sensationalism of slum reporting had been replaced by a mere footnote in an article about  curious  place names of the past.

            "target_summary": "In 1895, the brutal assault of Rosina Meagher, a young Welsh woman, by her husband in Newport's notorious \"Quiet Woman's Row\" ignited a potent media sensation. This ironically named street became a stark emblem for the pervasive domestic violence and squalid conditions the late-Victorian and Edwardian press sensationalized under the guise of \"slumland storytelling.\" This journalistic phenomenon, fueled by a desire for urban redevelopment and increased newspaper sales, blurred the lines between fact and fiction, transforming the grim realities of poverty into captivating, often lurid, entertainment for a curious middle-class readership.\n\nThe rapid urbanization and industrial shift of the 19th century had spawned overcrowded slums, where cheap, temporary housing fostered unsanitary conditions. These \"dens of iniquity\" provided rich fodder for writers and journalists alike, who crafted melodramatic narratives that painted slum dwellers with broad, gendered strokes. Men were invariably depicted as violent \"thugs\"; women were either \"unfeminine\" matriarchs lacking maternal instinct, or, more often, vulnerable \"innocents\" ensnared in cycles of domestic abuse, clinging desperately to respectability. Children were portrayed as feral street urchins or pure souls awaiting rescue. Women, particularly, became the focus, categorized as either uncouth criminals or submissive sexual victims, their supposed loss of virtue or criminality deemed particularly shocking. These narratives, always penned by outsiders, perpetuated deep-seated preconceptions of moral decay, portraying parts of cities as lawless \"Wild West\" territories.\n\n\"Slum tourism\" flourished, with polite society venturing into these \"dangerous\" quarters. Calls for wholesale slum clearances, like those in the Belfast-based Northern Whig, vividly detailed scenes of destitution, dying mothers, starving children \"vermin-swarmed,\" and omnipresent \"drunkenness, harlotry, murder and bestiality.\" Graphic descriptions of abused wives cowering from \"sullen, drunken, murderous brute[s]\" underscored a titillating, sexualized element to the violence, extending even to the popular \"slum fiction\" genre of the era.\n\nQuiet Woman's Row, a dockside street riddled with generations of sanitation issues and landlord neglect, epitomized these narratives. Its residents had long struggled for basic amenities, sharing woefully inadequate privies and enduring cramped, unsanitary homes. Though minor offences like arguments over washing lines or coal theft were common, often understandable given the harsh living conditions, the press relentlessly focused on the \"not so quiet women,\" portraying them as inherently disorderly. Rosina Meagher, positioned as a \"bourgeois ideal\" corrupted by her environment, became a national \"slumland sensation.\" Reporters descended, creating vivid scenes of \"coarse, dirty women\" and \"half-dressed children,\" reinforcing the image of an alien, morally bankrupt community.\n\nCrucially, newspaper reports consistently ignored the root causes of slum conditions—unemployment, low wages, and structural poverty—preferring instead to sensationalize crime and moral failings. This narrative strategy profoundly shaped public opinion and local policy. By depicting Quiet Woman's Row as a foreign, unsavable entity, distinct from \"ordinary\" Newport, the press effectively paved the way for its ultimate demise. In 1899, the Row was demolished, a relic of a \"curious\" past, its complex human stories ultimately reduced to a mere historical footnote, swept aside in the name of progress, fueled by the very sensationalism it had once embodied.",

            "content": "When Penguin published The Buildings of England: London Except the Cities of London and Westminster, Pevsner's text referred to the Rowton Houses in Camden Town as 'still belonging to the slums'. This brought a threat of action against the publisher for defamation. Rowton Houses are now largely forgotten, but figure in the Homes of the Homeless exhibition at the Geffrye Museum. Starting with life on the streets, the exhibition reveals that the homeless had to sleep during the day because the police moved them on at night. Homelessness became an acute problem in London as the drift from the country to the towns accelerated in the early 19th century. Itinerant workers, 'Navigators' or 'navvies', arrived in vast numbers to dig the canal network and to build the railway lines. Where were they to be housed? What would they eat? If a labourer lost his job, he and his family might be made homeless. The rapid growth of slums, often in close proximity to wealthy areas, alarmed those of the middling class and motivated religious zealots. Faster, cheaper methods of graphic reproduction fed the consternation of the better-off. Magazines such as the Graphic, the Illustrated London News and the Sketch shocked their readers with pictures of poverty. Religious campaigners fuelled controversy with pamphlets detailing the horrors of the slums. For the most part the curators ignore missionary campaigns, instead concentrating on housing provision. This varied from the municipal workhouse to common lodging houses. Visitors to the Geffrye can see what 'picking oakum' actually means; the bold may try a replica 'coffin bed' for size. Prince Albert, in his quest to improve housing for the poor, took up the architect Henry Roberts in the 1840s. Roberts was the honorary architect to the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes. Large watercolours and a model of his flats for the society open the exhibition. Built near the British Museum in 1849, they still stand today. They illustrate a problem for the reformers: how to design large buildings, for multiple occupation by separate families, without them being liable to Window Tax? A humble fourth-rate family house with six windows or fewer was exempt, a large block for a hundred people would be taxed at a shilling per window. Roberts was commissioned to design model cottages for poor families, which were shown at the Great Exhibition in 1851, the year that the Window Tax was repealed, permitting the building of immense blocks. Paintings in the exhibition tend to be sentimental rather than controversial, our empathy with photographs is more immediate. Jack London concealed a small camera about him when he lived rough in London. He used his surreptitious photographs to illustrate his People of the Abyss (1903). Photographs, whether taken secretly, or by those in positions of power, allow for no self-conscious posing: a queue of women awaiting free tea, eye the photographer unconcernedly. Almost life-size, their steady gaze is disconcerting. Their ragged clothes not a style statement, but the only ones that they possessed. Charles Dickens had known the horror of the workhouse and loathed the blacking factory to which he was sent to work. A fragment of a blacking bottle is shown, as is a bowl such as might have been used by Oliver Twist. An unexpected exhibit is a stuffed and mounted stag's head from a Rowton House. The caption claims that they were considered as luxurious as gentlemen's clubs in the West End. Spartan as the establishments of Pall Mall and St James's may be, they are not as grim as Rowton lodgings. Pevsner was not dragged into court: the management of the Rowton Houses were content with an apology and an erratum slip. Sportingly, they sent Pevsner an invitation to spend a night to see for himself. His reaction is not recorded, but one suspects he did not see the joke. Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London is at the Geffrye Museum until July 12th, 2015. David Brady is a historian of art, architecture and design.",
            "target_summary": "The Geffrye Museum's \"Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London\" exhibition vividly illuminates the harsh realities of destitution, serendipitously linking back to Pevsner's controversial description of Rowton Houses as \"slums.\" This exhibition, which once threatened a defamation suit for its publisher, now delves into the largely forgotten world of London's Victorian homeless.\n\nThe exhibition uncovers the genesis of this acute social crisis, which escalated in the early 19th century as rural populations flocked to urban centers. Massive influxes of \"navvies\" for canal and railway construction created an urgent need for housing, and job loss often plunged families into immediate homelessness. The resulting proliferation of slums, startlingly close to affluent areas, ignited alarm among the middle classes and zealots alike. This consternation was fueled by new, cheaper graphic reproduction methods, allowing magazines like *The Graphic* to shock readers with stark images of poverty, while religious pamphlets sensationalized slum horrors. Eschewing missionary narratives, the curators instead focus on the practicalities of housing provision, from the grim municipal workhouse, where visitors can ponder the meaning of 'picking oakum' or brave a replica 'coffin bed', to common lodging houses.\n\nReform efforts are highlighted, notably Prince Albert's patronage of architect Henry Roberts in the 1840s. Roberts's pioneering flats, built near the British Museum in 1849 and still standing, exemplify the era's design challenges, particularly the oppressive Window Tax. Its eventual repeal in 1851, the year Roberts's model cottages debuted at the Great Exhibition, finally enabled the construction of immense, multi-occupancy blocks for the working poor.\n\nThe power of visual representation is a central theme. While contemporary paintings often offered sentimentalized views of poverty, photography provided an immediate, unvarnished truth. Secretly taken photographs, like Jack London's for *The People of the Abyss*, and official images alike, capture unposed subjects—a queue of ragged women awaiting tea, their disconcertingly steady gaze revealing the raw dignity of survival. Echoes of personal hardship resonate through exhibits like a fragment of a blacking bottle, reminiscent of Charles Dickens's own childhood trauma, and objects like a bowl evoking Oliver Twist's plight. Unexpectedly, a stuffed stag's head from a Rowton House, paradoxically claiming a luxurious equivalence to West End gentlemen's clubs, underscores the desperate attempt to elevate these stark lodgings. Ultimately, the Pevsner incident resolved amicably with an apology and a facetious invitation, reminding us of the human element behind these historical accounts.",

            "content": "During the First World War, specialist hospitals were established, intended to  cure  patients of shell shock and send them back to the front. One curative approach was ergotherapy, or  cure by functioning , a treatment we would today identify as occupational therapy, which encouraged patients to remain active and take part in work and recreational activities. This emphasis on activity as cure is rooted in the changes to mental health care which began with the work of  mad-doctor  William Battie in the 1700s. Care for  the insane  shifted away from the more oppressive methods employed in early asylums, towards humane care and moral discipline. One of the key changes   alongside an emphasis on regimen, work and recreation   was the prioritisation of patients  creative expression. In the long 19th century, patients at sanatoria were encouraged to paint, knit and write poetry and prose as part of their care. As a result of this, a number of establishments, from 1837 until the mid-20th century, produced patient-led hospital magazines. Craiglockhart War Hospital, a military psychiatric hospital in Edinburgh, introduced a hospital magazine in 1917, for which some soldiers wrote as part of their therapeutic treatment. It was called The Hydra, in reference to the hospital s prewar role as a centre for hydrotherapy, where the Victorians had come for water treatments. It also evoked the many-headed monster of Greek mythology, reinforced by its cover image of the terrible creature   a reference writer John Garth says was  wry humour by officers suffering from war trauma . Edited for a time by Wilfred Owen and including poems by fellow writer Siegfried Sassoon, who referred to the hospital as  Dottyville , The Hydra served as a platform for patients to express their creativity. Sassoon s poem  Dreamers  was first published in its pages, and Owen s poems  Dulce et Decorum est  and  Anthem for Doomed Youth  were written during his time at the hospital. The Hydra was, and still is, a valuable document for understanding the inner lives of those suffering from shell shock and seeking psychological amelioration through the arts. It also enabled patients to showcase their creative interpretations of the war to a wider audience. The team behind the magazine was aware of this and delighted in it: one editorial proclaimed,  The Hydra has already acquired a footing in the world outside, and when we found a copy reposing bashfully in a hairdresser s shop we were overcome with joy.  Craiglockhart is thought to be a key hospital in revolutionising mental health care after the First World War and the double outcome of The Hydra   in its advocating of patient care and its prioritising of patients  voices   played an important role in this. Through The Hydra, patients could unite their voices with others advocating change. The historian Tracey Loughran has suggested that shell shock provided a powerful impetus for reform of the mental health care system, demonstrating a need for effective and immediate treatment for those suffering from what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder. Although there was a strong movement for reform, the Mental Treatment Act, which made provision for voluntary treatment at outpatient clinics, was not passed until 1930. Likewise, despite this prominent challenge to the government s inadequate mental health care facilities, it appears that attitudes within the military did not change. Institutional improvements were very slow, which meant that individual doctors had to carry the lessons learned from helping shell-shocked patients into their postwar careers. Mental health was not a priority for the government, nor did military authorities maintain a psychiatric service, despite the fact that 80,000 officers and ordinary soldiers had suffered a debilitating mental disability by the end of the war. Today s system for providing mental health care is much more robust and it is recognised that creativity can play a key role in psychological wellbeing. This, however, is jeopardised by continuous cuts to arts funding and to the National Health Service. April 28th marks 100 years since the first publication of The Hydra and it is worth using this centenary to think about the battles which have been fought over the last century to advance understanding of, and provision for, mental health care. Emily Turner is a PhD student at the University of Sussex, researching creativity in mental health.",
            "target_summary": "During the First World War, specialist hospitals were established to treat shell shock, employing \"ergotherapy\"—a precursor to modern occupational therapy—which emphasized activity and work for mental well-being. This therapeutic approach, rooted in 18th-century reforms by William Battie, shifted mental health care towards humane treatment and moral discipline, notably prioritizing creative expression alongside regimen and recreation. By the 19th century, sanatoria encouraged patients to engage in arts like painting and writing, leading to patient-led hospital magazines.\n\nA prime example was *The Hydra*, launched in 1917 at Craiglockhart War Hospital, a military psychiatric facility in Edinburgh. Its name, referencing both hydrotherapy and the multi-headed monster of Greek mythology, carried a darkly humorous nod to the trauma suffered by soldiers. This magazine became a vital therapeutic platform, edited by Wilfred Owen and featuring poems by Siegfried Sassoon, including Owen's iconic \"Dulce et Decorum est\" and \"Anthem for Doomed Youth.\" It provided a powerful outlet for soldiers to express their inner lives and experiences of war, gaining recognition beyond the hospital walls.\n\n*The Hydra* and Craiglockhart were pivotal in advocating for patient-centered care and prioritizing patient voices, significantly influencing post-WW1 mental health reform. Historians suggest that shell shock provided a potent catalyst for systemic change, highlighting the urgent need for effective treatment for what is now understood as post-traumatic stress disorder. However, despite this advocacy, institutional improvements were slow; the Mental Treatment Act, for instance, wasn't passed until 1930, and military attitudes largely remained unchanged.\n\nToday, while mental health care is more robust and recognizes the importance of creativity, it faces threats from continuous cuts to arts and healthcare funding. The centenary of *The Hydra*'s first publication serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring struggle to advance understanding and provision for mental health, underscoring the vital role of creative expression in healing and advocacy.",

A Japanese teenager named Manjir , from an impoverished family in a tiny fishing village, found himself thrust into a struggle for survival after being shipwrecked on a Pacific atoll in 1841. Following a dramatic maritime rescue, Manjir  was catapulted into a decade-long series of adventures in which he became the first Japanese known to have lived in the United States, circumnavigated the globe and then participated in the California Gold Rush. Yet Manjir  never lost his desire to return home to  closed , isolationist Japan. After a daring effort at repatriation, his knowledge of the United States made him a valuable resource for his native government at the moment that Japan faced the dilemma of  opening  to the West. His story and its significance have been overlooked, but Manjir  (Japanese commoners at that time rarely had surnames) played an integral role in Japan s relations with the West and its transformation into a  modernised  state in the second half of the 19th century.

            "content": "The First World War centenary gave us a better understanding of the vast contribution made by the Indian Army to that conflict. The focus, though, was on the soldiers and little was made of the thousands of Indians who travelled to France and Mesopotamia as  followers  and labourers   mule drivers, sweepers, stretcher-bearers, porters and construction workers. Few could write so their story can seem impossible to recover. This gap has now been filled by Radhika Singha, a professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, who has devoted nearly a decade to researching the Indian Labour Corps (ILC). Her thoughtful, meticulous history is sobering in what it reveals. Of the 1.4 million Indians recruited up to the end of 1919, 563,369 were non-combatants. Many were from the frontier hill states of Assam, Bihar and Orissa. There were strong inducements to join up: those who volunteered became exempt for life from an onerous house tax and any further labour obligations. For some, the prospect of returning to India with funds to marry may have been attractive. For others there may have been a sense of adventure. On arrival in Mesopotamia, canals needed to be deepened and extended, roads built and railway lines laid down, all in blistering heat. Singha has mined regional archives, official reports, unit diaries and private accounts to piece together stories of impossibly long hours, punishing journeys on foot to remote worksites and lack of proper equipment and clothing. Lieutenant Maynard Knight, a tea planter commanding a detachment of the 1st Madras Labour Corps, reported that a great number of his men, their hands cut and bruised through work on the Khanikin railway, had  no boots at all, and only one blanket a piece . Desertion was at first punished by flogging, but seeing potential issues, the military instead set up  disciplinary camps  surrounded by barbed wire. There was at one point an urgent need for sanitation workers and the authorities turned to Indian jails for this dangerously unhygienic work. Prisoners were recruited with  suspicious swiftness . Travelling by train to Bombay, the newly enlisted men of the 5th United Provinces Jail Porter Corps pulled the communication cord no fewer than seven times and by the end of the journey seven of them were missing. Deployed in France from 1917 onwards, the ILC found the long sea route to Marseilles bewildering and traumatic. Overcrowding led to dysentery and, to the recruits  great distress, some of their companions had to be buried at sea. The labourers were put to work clearing the battlefields of the Western Front. Lord Ampthill, former Governor of Madras, wondered how men  from the hills and jungles, who have barely emerged from barbarism  would shape up as labour. Not long after, Ampthill was admitting to a colleague the dangers these men faced:  Mills bombs lurk in the grass and explode at a touch.  Two Jesuit priests travelled with the ILC and observed them clearing the Somme battlefields: Every five yards we come across bones still wrapped up in their putties, arms and legs blown off by shell-fire. One of our old Ranchi boys had his heart full and stood by weeping. The Park of Thiepval is covered with human remains. Throughout this story of exploitation, Singha s tone is measured, just occasionally describing her reactions to sources. Through faint but poignant traces, the lives of the ILC open up to the reader.

            "target_summary": "While the First World War centenary brought the contributions of Indian soldiers into sharper focus, the vast, often harrowing experiences of the hundreds of thousands of Indian non-combatant labourers remained largely untold. This significant historical gap has now been meticulously filled by Radhika Singha’s \"The Coolie’s Great War,\" which unearths a sobering account of the Indian Labour Corps (ILC). From 1914-1919, over half a million non-combatants were recruited, often from frontier hill states, lured by inducements like tax exemptions or the promise of marriage funds.\n\nTheir service in Mesopotamia involved backbreaking infrastructure work – deepening canals, building roads, and laying railway lines – all under blistering heat and with a scarcity of basic provisions, leading to cut hands, bruised feet, and men without boots.

Desperate for sanitation workers, authorities even recruited prisoners from Indian jails for dangerously unhygienic duties, some attempting to escape.\n\nThe journey to France was equally traumatic, with overcrowded ships leading to dysentery and burials at sea.

            "content": "It is difficult to forget a work of history that begins with a discussion of the author s dental history and ends with a reflection on the beret as symbol of the Vichy regime in France. Perhaps that is why Richard Cobb s French and Germans, Germans and French has stuck with me ever since I first read it as an undergraduate student. Out of print since it was first published in 1983, this unique study of the lived experience of occupation in France during two World Wars has been reissued as a handsome paperback in Penguin s  Modern Classics  series. French and Germans is an idiosyncratic book, but Richard Cobb was an idiosyncratic historian. Primarily known as a specialist of the French Revolution, he began his research career in Paris in the late 1930s before being called up in 1941. Having spent several years at the end of the war as an interpreter based in France, Belgium and Germany, Cobb resumed his decidedly unconventional career in 1946. Appointed to a lectureship at Aberystwyth in 1955, he proudly advertised his second, French, identity, publishing primarily in French until the late 1960s. For Cobb, a true understanding of history could not be achieved through archival research alone. Rather, in the historian David Gilmour s words, it had to be  walked, observed, smelt, drunk  in Paris and elsewhere. Cobb s study of France under occupation was published towards the end of his academic career, appearing in the same year as the first volume of his memoirs, Still Life: Sketches from a Tunbridge Wells Childhood. The book began life as a series of lectures on occupied France delivered in Britain and America, each one fuelled by a pint of Guinness, which Cobb sipped throughout as he warmed to his theme. French and Germans is not the product of the kind of marathon archival research that underpins much of Cobb s other work   nor does it pretend to be. Cobb described the book as  a personal interpretation , a provocation to further research rather than the last word on the subject. The book is divided into two parts: a single chapter on occupants and occup s in the department of the Nord during the First World War and four more substantial chapters on occupation and collaboration between 1940 and 1944. Cobb s evocative, if sometimes meandering, reflections draw on a range of material, including newspapers, memoirs, novels and personal recollections, as well as the historian s own imagination. Cobb was not afraid to acknowledge the part played by his own experience of France at war in shaping his historical reflections. As he saw it, it was impossible  to divorce history from experience . Cobb s book was a response to a significant shift in historical and cultural understandings of the Occupation and the Vichy regime, which began in the late 1960s. The French filmmaker Marcel Ophuls  seminal 1969 documentary The Sorrow and the Pity revealed the complexity of collaboration and resistance in the town of Clermont-Ferrand. The film inaugurated what the French historian Henry Rousso would later describe as the  broken mirror , as the old certainties of de Gaulle s  eternal France  were challenged. Instead of a nation united in resistance to the occupier and the illegitimate Vichy government, a rather different picture of wartime France began to emerge. As Cobb notes in the bibliographical essay at the end of French and Germans, work by Anglophone scholars was central to this shift. Among them were Robert Paxton, whose 1972 book Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order sent shockwaves through France and demonstrated the scale of willing collaboration between Vichy and the Nazis; and Rod Kedward, whose 1978 work Resistance in Vichy France marked a turning point in the historiography of the French Resistance. What marks French and Germans as a classic work of history, above all, is its evocation of occupation on a human scale. Cobb was always a historian of individuals, insisting that the past could only be properly understood  in terms of human relationships . This approach is at the heart of French and Germans, and gives the book warmth and intimacy. Cobb is at his best when conveying the complex relationships and interactions between the occupiers and occupied through glimpses (sometimes imagined) of their shared existence. Cobb imagines a working-class French woman in a relationship with a German soldier, waking in the night in the spring of 1918, noticing  his leather belt (with Gott Mit Uns clasp) , and hearing  the continuous rumble  in the distance. Cobb is sensitive in his handling of women and their children born  to an unknown father . For Cobb, therefore, there can be no simplistic oppositions in understanding the experience of occupation in 20th-century France. As he shows, for most Frenchmen and women the overwhelming response to occupation was what Henry Rousso would later characterise as attentisme: wait and see. Did waiting and seeing equate to collaboration with the occupying Nazis? Cobb reminds us that  collaboration is an endlessly elastic concept .  Was anyone who worked, directly or indirectly, for the Germans a collaborator? , he asks. What of the Paris M tro driver, continuing to do his job even as he knew that his train carried  German, as well as French, passengers, wedged fraternally like   sardines?  Occupation was lived not in black and white, but shades of grey. There has been much historiographical water under the bridge since French and Germans first appeared in 1983. New evidence and innovative approaches by successive generations of historians have ensured the study of France under occupation remains vital, exciting and often provocative. There is still a place, however, for Cobb s distinctive voice. At the start of the book, he states that his main concern is that  the present study   should make enjoyable reading . And it certainly does   but, more than that, French and Germans remains a reflective and thought-provoking work that challenges readers to leave aside any assumptions that  it can t happen here . The final word goes to Cobb:  Let us not be deceived into believing   that the history of Vichy   has nothing to teach us.

            "target_summary": "Richard Cobb's *French and Germans, Germans and French*, a remarkably idiosyncratic yet deeply insightful historical work, has been reissued in Penguin's Modern Classics series, ensuring its continued relevance. First published in 1983, this unique study delves into the lived experience of occupation in France during both World Wars, offering a perspective as unconventional as its author. Cobb, primarily known for his work on the French Revolution, was a historian who believed that true understanding transcended mere archival research, advocating for history to be \"walked, observed, smelt, drunk.\"\n\nHis personal interpretation of France under occupation, developed from lectures fuelled by Guinness, is not a product of marathon archival deep-dives but rather a \"provocation to further research.\" The book covers the department of the Nord during WWI and expands to the 1940-1944 period, drawing on an eclectic mix of newspapers, memoirs, novels, and his own experiences and imagination. Cobb was unapologetic about the role of his personal connection to wartime France in shaping his reflections, seeing history and experience as inseparable.\n\n*French and Germans* emerged at a pivotal moment in historical scholarship, contributing significantly to the evolving understanding of the Occupation and the Vichy regime. Following works like Marcel Ophuls' *The Sorrow and the Pity* and groundbreaking studies by Anglophone scholars such as Robert Paxton and Rod Kedward, Cobb's book further challenged the myth of a unified, resistant \"eternal France,\" revealing a more complex reality of collaboration and nuanced responses.\n\nThe book's enduring power lies in its masterful evocation of occupation on a profoundly human scale. Cobb, a historian of individuals, meticulously portrays the intricate human relationships between occupiers and occupied, eschewing simplistic dichotomies. Through evocative, sometimes imagined, glimpses—like a French woman sharing a bed with a German soldier or a Metro driver continuing his route despite carrying German passengers—he reveals the \"shades of grey\" in daily life. He sensitively explores concepts like \"attentisme\" (wait and see) and the \"endlessly elastic concept\" of collaboration, showing that for many, survival meant navigating morally ambiguous territory rather than clear-cut resistance or complicity.\n\nDespite subsequent decades of new research and methodologies, Cobb's distinctive, reflective, and often provocative voice retains its vital place in historiography. His primary aim was to make history \"enjoyable reading,\" but *French and Germans* achieves far more, serving as a powerful reminder against complacency and challenging readers to confront the difficult lessons of the past. As Cobb himself warned, \"Let us not be deceived into believing...that the history of Vichy...has nothing to teach us.\"",

            "content": "With biographies of all the big-name poets of the Great War (with the exception of Wilfred Owen) to her name, Jean Moorcroft Wilson has established herself as the foremost authority on a subject that increasingly informs the way Britain s public views the conflict as a whole. Seeing the war through the prism of these writers of pity and protest may be a distorting mirror, but given the increasingly pacific nature of our society, the view of the war poets may come to be posterity s settled verdict on the struggle. With this weighty volume, which covers Graves  early life, his war experiences and the troubled postwar decade that led up to the publication of his autobiography, Goodbye to All That   hastily written as a money-making potboiler, but now probably the best-known account by a frontline officer   Wilson has again chalked up a formidable achievement. Her special gift is to integrate a penetrating critique of the poetry into her narrative of the life that gave birth to it. In Graves  case this is particularly important as he first suppressed, then neglected the poems he wrote in the trenches, feeling that they were not worthy of his later elevated bardic view of his muse. In fact, many of the poems rediscovered by Wilson are not bad at all and she does Graves  reputation a favour by resurrecting them. Born in the London suburb of Wimbledon to an elderly Irish father and a German mother, Graves grew up in an intellectual atmosphere, amid a tribe of siblings. Bullied at his public school, Charterhouse, he reacted by becoming a boxer and fighting back. About to go up to Oxford, the outbreak of war found him at his family s holiday home in Harlech, North Wales. He enlisted immediately in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Wilson   unafraid to criticise her subject   makes it very clear that Graves was an unpopular officer. His slovenly, individualistic ways defied the army s attempt to force him into a conformist mould. Salvation came in the form of his friendship with Siegfried Sassoon, when his fellow poet joined the same regiment. Though they later fell out over the fibs and inaccuracies in Graves  memoirs, the relationship was crucial to both men, not least when Graves defended his friend after Sassoon protested against the war. Desperately wounded on the Somme, Graves ended the war a nervous and physical wreck. His first marriage ended when he fell under the spell of the poet and essayist Laura Riding. By then he had found his true metier: as a poet. Graves  eventful life and colourful personality has attracted several biographers. Wilson pays him the compliment of treating him as a son, brother, lover, soldier and war victim, but above all as one of Britain s greatest modern writers.

            "target_summary": "Jean Moorcroft Wilson, a preeminent authority on Great War poets, deeply shapes public understanding of the conflict by viewing it through the prism of these writers of pity and protest. Her latest, weighty biography delves into the eventful life of Robert Graves, meticulously chronicling his early years, harrowing wartime experiences, and the tumultuous postwar decade that led to his iconic autobiography, \"Goodbye to All That.\" Wilson's singular talent lies in seamlessly weaving incisive poetic analysis into the life story that birthed it—a crucial approach given Graves's later dismissal of his own trench poems. Wilson judiciously resurrects many of these unfairly neglected works, significantly bolstering his literary standing.\n\nBorn into an intellectual London household, the bullied Charterhouse student who found solace in boxing, Graves immediately enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers upon the war's outbreak. Wilson candidly portrays him as an unpopular, individualistic officer, whose saving grace arrived with his crucial friendship with Siegfried Sassoon. Their pivotal bond, forged in shared regiment and intellectual camaraderie, proved invaluable when Graves staunchly defended Sassoon's anti-war protest. Severely wounded on the Somme, Graves emerged from the war a shattered man, both physically and psychologically. His first marriage dissolved as he embarked on a new poetic journey with Laura Riding, having finally embraced his true calling as a poet. Wilson's biography honors Graves not merely as a complex figure—son, soldier, lover—but, above all, as one of Britain's most significant modern writers, offering a penetrating portrait of his eventful life and colourful personality.",

            "content": "For most of the past hundred years, horror, sorrow and trauma have been the leading motifs of the First World War. They define how its centenary has been commemorated. On one level, this makes sense. Aside from the occasional inspiring story of self-sacrifice, only fools and knaves find much to celebrate in war and each generation has a duty to warn the next of its evil. Over the last four years, however, it has been easy to forget that this was not a war in which there were no victors. Few in Britain or France during the 1920s and 1930s, whatever their struggles, would ever have wished to exchange places with their counterparts in the states roiled by violence, revolution and worse that succeeded imperial Germany, Austria-Hungary and tsarist Russia. Better not to fight, but if you must fight, then it is better to win. In 1918 the British found themselves on the victorious side of the largest and most complex war to date. How did they get there?",
            "target_summary": "For a century, the First World War has been predominantly understood through the somber lens of horror, sorrow, and trauma, a framing vividly reiterated during its centenary. This perspective, while vital for impressing upon future generations the profound evils of war, often overlooks the critical distinction between victory and defeat. Indeed, in the tumultuous decades after 1918, citizens of victorious nations like Britain and France, despite their own struggles, certainly would not have exchanged fates with those in the war-torn, revolutionary states that emerged from the defeated empires. The article thus pivots to investigate how Britain ultimately secured its position among the victors of this unprecedented global conflict.",
