        "title": "The Rise of Air Conditioning",
        "content": "Politicians and diplomats are heading to Katowice, Poland, in December for the next round of international climate negotiations. This summer s heatwave   an  unambiguous  sign of global warming, according to a recent report   will be in their minds. A major cause of that warming is two centuries of rising consumption of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas). Large-scale coal consumption began during the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century. Oil boomed from the start of the 20th. Use of all fossil fuels then expanded dramatically during the Second World War and the economic boom that followed. This expansion was one of several impacts of economic activity on the natural world that earth systems scientists define collectively as the  great acceleration . This is seen as part of the Anthropocene, a new geological epoch in which the impacts of human activity work on the same scale as great natural forces. The identification in the 1980s of global warming, perhaps the most dangerous such impact, did nothing to slow fossil fuel consumption growth. Today, the quantity of greenhouse gases pumped out by fossil fuel use in three years is about the same as that produced in the whole of the 19th century. Who has been consuming all these fossil fuels? Rather than individual households, it is more accurate to think about technological systems   car-based transport and the urban infrastructure that supports it; electricity networks; industrial systems reliant on carbon-heavy materials such as steel; and agricultural methods that soak up gas-based fertilisers   and the social and economic systems in which they are embedded. Take electric air conditioning (AC) systems, used widely in hot summers. They first appeared in large numbers before the First World War, in the US, which had pioneered the installation of urban electricity networks from the 1880s and led the way in popularising appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and radios. In the 1920s, AC was marketed aggressively, as were electric lighting and motor cars. Manufacturers, anxious to sell to schools, battled furiously against New York state regulators, who argued that fresh air from open windows would be better for pupils  health than conditioned air. Sales of AC units, like other consumer electric goods, soared again in the US in the boom that followed the Second World War. The doubts of homeowners and office managers, many of whom regarded AC as a luxury, were overridden by the construction industry, who were convinced by AC manufacturers to install it as standard. AC made urban growth and industrial production possible in the tropical climate of the US southern states, as the historian Raymond Arsenault showed in his seminal article of 1984,  The End of the Long Hot Summer . In the 1960s, AC was a major cause of the reversal of the trend of out-migration from the South to other parts of the US. By the 1980s, AC, like other energy-guzzling household technologies, was already ubiquitous in US cities and common in other rich countries. Today, such technologies are condemned as wasteful of fossil fuels. An interpretive challenge in researching and discussing the global history of fossil fuel consumption is to explain how   even after the world s governments acknowledged, at the 1992 Rio summit, the need to stop global warming   their use continued to rise. It is a common fallacy that soaring fossil fuel use in the last quarter of a century is largely about first-world consumer technologies, such as AC, being diffused across developing countries. There are small, relatively rich, corners of the global south where these are used, but their contribution to total global fuel consumption is minor. And the fundamental inequalities remain. Canada s per-head energy consumption is estimated at 450 times higher than that of the poorest African countries. US households use four times as much electricity for air conditioning alone as Nigeria s use for everything. But this is not solely about first-world consumers. Final-user technologies develop and spread as part of larger systems. AC, for example, needs a reliable electricity supply, which is beyond the reach not only of 14 per cent of the world s population, who have no electricity, but of a further 25 per cent or so who have limited or erratic supply. Furthermore, AC and other electrical appliances have become a part of life in energy-intensive cities largely built with energy-intensive materials, such as cement and steel. These cities are characterised by badly insulated buildings and energy-wasteful transport systems: these two inefficiencies consume far more fossil fuels than AC systems. During the postwar boom, when fossil fuels were cheap, technologies that used them were scarcely regulated. The 1970s  oil price shocks made for temporary improvement; much of that progress was reversed in the 1980s; the threat of global warming has stimulated little action. From plastics to construction, aviation and car travel, governments allowed (indeed, encouraged) crucial decisions to be made according to companies  profit motives. Japan   where the energy efficiency of new AC systems rose by 68 per cent in the decade to 2005, because regulators required improvements   is the exception that proves the rule, at least in regard to AC. Weak regulation is part of a larger political problem: the ideological conviction that it is market mechanisms that can and must reduce fossil fuel consumption. This belief underpinned both the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which failed to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and the 2015 Paris agreement, with its voluntary   and inadequate   targets. Governments that failed to put money into moving away from fossil fuels nevertheless oversaw hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for those fuels. Technological systems have evolved the way they have because of the social and economic systems in which they are embedded. A move away from fossil fuels requires the wholesale transformation of all these systems. Simon Pirani is the author of Burning Up: A Global History of Fossil Fuel Consumption (Pluto Press, 2018).",

At some point on the evening of 13 June, while his company was on tour in Thame in Oxfordshire, Towne had entered into a heated argument with his colleague William Knell. Whatever the cause, the quarrel quickly turned violent, with Knell drawing his sword. Retreating atop a mound in an area called White Hound Close, Towne found himself cornered. A report from the coroner s inquest informs us what happened next: Knell continuing his attack as before, so maliciously and furiously, and Towne   to save his life drew his sword of iron (price five shillings) and   thrust it into the neck of William Knell and made a mortal wound three inches deep and one inch wide.

It's a reminder of just how fragile the internet services we rely upon can be. On Monday 20 October 2025, millions of users woke to find their favourite apps, gaming sites, online banking and internet tools were not available. The problem is thought to have been caused by an error with a database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the online retailer's cloud computing division. AWS provides online computing infrastructure for millions of large companies' websites and platforms. The outage affected the hugely popular games Roblox, Fortnite and Pok mon Go, the social media platform Snapchat, productivity tools Slack and Monday.com, along with dozens of banks. It is the latest in a number of high-profile outages to have hit the internet recently. As our infrastructure becomes ever more tangled with the internet, this won't be the last catastrophic online outage either. The history of computing is littered with examples of our digital fragility, and crashes of the past offer a glimpse of what it will feel like on the day the internet turns off. On Friday 19 July, 2024, the world woke up to what many have called the worst digital crisis of all time. A botched software update from cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike crashed some 8.5 million computers, smearing Microsoft's dreaded \"blue screen of death\" across the globe. Airlines cancelled over 46,000 flights in a single day, according to the FlightAware. Hospitals called off surgeries. 911 emergency services faced disruptions in the US. Film Forum, an arthouse cinema in New York, switched to cash payments as its credit card system went down. Microsoft and CrowdStrike issued a solution, but the disruption it caused continued for several days afterwards. It's a reminder, frustrated IT experts said, to never push updates out on a Friday.",

Keith Wade supervised more than 50 digs in the town while working for Suffolk County Council archaeological service for more than 40 years. Ipswich dates back to the 7th Century, was occupied by the Vikings and was burnt down by William the Conqueror. Mr Wade has published a book about the town's 1,400-year history to \"make the early importance of Ipswich more widely known\". Suffolk County Council The 1980s excavation, ahead of the construction of the Buttermarket Shopping Centre, revealed centuries of habitation \"For me, Ipswich has been an outstanding archaeological project,\" he said. \"I was privileged to be in the right place at the right time to excavate in Ipswich for over 40 years.\" His book, titled Gipeswic: The Anglo-Saxon Town of Ipswich, supports Mr Wade's long-held belief Ipswich is the country's oldest town with continuous occupation on the same site. It describes how it began as a landing place for 7th Century European traders and became a permanent town in the early 8th Century. This makes it one of the three earliest English towns - the others being Southampton and London. Suffolk County Council Finds include an early medieval lead brooch, dating back to the 9th Century Mr Wade has been a local archaeologist since 1974 and retired from the county's archaeological service in 2012. His excavations included one ahead of the construction of the Buttermarket Shopping Centre.

        "content": "Anger as historic Clyde ship towed out to sea and sunk in Hawaii 18 October 2025 Share Save Calum Watson BBC Scotland Share Save Getty Images The Honolulu Harbour Board wanted the ship removed so it could redevelop the harbour A historic Clydebuilt sailing ship has been towed out to sea off the coast of Hawaii and deliberately sunk, prompting outrage from maritime heritage groups. Falls of Clyde, built in 1878, had been moored as a museum ship in Honolulu since the 1960s but had fallen into a poor state of repair. The Honolulu Harbour Board confirmed it had the ship towed into deep water about 25 miles offshore on Wednesday and then scuttled. The news has been met with anger and dismay by campaigners who have spent more than a decade trying to bring the ship back to its birthplace to rebuild it. Falls of Clyde was the first in a series of nine iron-hulled ships, all named after Scottish waterfalls, built in the late 19th Century by the Port Glasgow shipbuilder Russell & Co. The ship spent many years carrying various cargoes to and from the Far East and Australasia before moving to Hawaii. Hawaii Department of Transportation Falls of Clyde was towed out of Honolulu Harbour at dawn and scuttled in deep water In the early 20th Century it had steel tanks fitted and was converted into a tanker to carry paraffin to the islands, where it later became a floating fuel depot before being acquired by a museum in Honolulu. But the ship was badly damaged by a hurricane in the 1980s, the maritime section of the museum closed down and for years it has been left slowly decaying. Enthusiasts in Scotland have spent a decade trying to bring the ship home for restoration, but were unable to reach an agreement with the harbour board which wants to redevelop the quay where it was moored. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said the operation to remove the ship began at dawn on Wednesday and it was sunk about 25 miles south of the harbour. It said the vessel's name, wheel and bell were retained along with other artefacts which will be put on display. 'A day that will go down in infamy' The destruction of the historic ship has been widely criticised by maritime heritage groups both in the UK and the USA. Friends of Falls of Clyde, a group of supporters in Hawaii, described it as \"a day that will go down in infamy\". \"It is almost inconceivable that this situation has been allowed to happen,\" the group posted on social media. The group organised a farewell ceremony with bagpipers on Tuesday after learning that the ship was to be sunk the following morning. The Tall Ship Glenlee, the charity that looks after another Clydebuilt sailing vessel moored beside Glasgow's Riverside Museum, said it was \"deeply saddened\". Falls of Clyde had been one of only six surviving large sailing vessels built on the Clyde, and only two remain in the UK - Glenlee and the Cutty Sark. David O'Neill, from the Scotland based Save Falls of Clyde campaign, said he was \"horrified\" at the behaviour of the authorities in Hawaii but had become resigned to the ship meeting such a fate after years of fruitless negotiation. He first became involved in efforts to rescue the ship in 2015 when someone in Hawaii alerted him to its condition, prompting him to post an appeal on social media saying: \"Old Scottish lady needs a lift home.\" A Norwegian firm which operates heavy lift ships offered to transport Falls of Clyde back to Scotland for free, but the campaign was soon embroiled in a wrangle with the harbour board over insurance costs and other conditions. A 19th Century oil painting of Falls of Clyde when it sailed in the Far East Earlier this year Mr O'Neill said an American firm won a contract to remove the ship from the harbour and it also offered to transport it to Scotland for free. \"They didn't want to sink the ship - they had a conscience and a respect for maritime heritage,\" he said. But the deal between the firm and the harbour board fell through, and the contract went instead to another company which then carried out the scuttling. The Hawaii Department of Transportation (DOT) director Ed Sniffen said it had made the \"difficult but necessary\" decision in a bid to protect the immediate and long-term security of Honolulu Harbour. \"The port is the state's economic lifeline as 85% of goods consumed in Hawaii must be imported and 91% of those goods reach our islands through this critical facility,\" he said. \"Since 2008, the Hawaii DOT afforded ample opportunity to the Friends of Falls of Clyde and other parties interested in restoring, preserving, and/or repatriating the vessel. \"A number of well-intentioned plans and efforts were not fruitful and did not address the risk the deteriorating vessel posed to the port.\" He said that before the ship was sunk the contractor removed materials that may degrade the marine environment, including pollutants and items that could create debris. He added that the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act permit also required consideration of land-based alternatives prior to authorisation of ocean disposal but no land-based disposal options were determined to be feasible.

        "content": "Skeletons found in mass grave are ancient Roman soldiers, study finds Scientists believe the skeletons, which were found completely intact, belong to men who lived 1,700 years ago Now, researchers from several European archaeological institutions have been able to determine not only when the men lived, but also how they may have died. Mursa was conquered by the Romans during the first century BC and became a large settlement that was also an important centre for trade and craft. The male skeletons, all with various injuries, were found \"completely preserved\" during excavations in 2011 at the site of the Roman city of Mursa - modern-day Osijek - in Croatia's far east, a new research paper says. Scientists say seven skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia were most likely Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago. According to the paper, the men in the grave were aged between 36-50 years old, taller-than-average in height, and were \"robust\" individuals. Their diets were mainly vegetarian, but some had also indulged in a little meat and seafood. All showed various healed and un-healed injuries, including those caused by blunt force trauma, and there were puncture wounds on two of their torsos, which the scientists believe were likely caused by arrows or spear tips. All of the men were suffering from some kind of \"pulmonary [affecting the lungs] disease during the final days of their lives\". DNA analysis has also revealed the men had a mix of ancestry and that none appeared to be from the local area. The paper noted that the Roman Empire was a particularly violent era and that Mursa was involved in several conflicts. The researchers believe the men were likely victims of the 'Crisis of the Third Century', most probably the battle of Mursa from 260 CE, when there were \"numerous battles fought between various claimants to the throne\". The paper states that the pit the skeletons were found in would have originally been a water-well - several of which have been discovered in the area. It notes that mass burials and mass graves were \"not a customary way of interring the dead in the Roman Empire\", and were mostly used in extreme situations and mass casualty events. Given the various angles the skeletons now lie, the researchers say they were \"most probably thrown in\" the well before being covered with soil. Mursa has been of archaeological importance for years, with various ancient civilisation sites discovered in the area.",

Producer Robert \"Bumps\" Blackwell said he didn't appreciate Richard until he saw him play at the city's famous Dew Drop Inn. He said: \"That was when I begin to know and understand Richard, because all you've got to do is give Richard an audience, turn the lights on, and the show is on.\" Richard's bandmate and friend Ron Jones recalled in the Arena documentary: \"He jumped on the piano and sang, 'Awop-bop-a loo bop alop-bam-boom!' So they heard it and said, 'Wait a minute, what's that?' It was a hook that they had never heard before, but Richard had been singing that phrase for years on the Chitlin' Circuit.\" Richard's influence spanned generations and genres But if Tutti Frutti was going to be a hit record, its risqu  lyrics needed a major rewrite. Deacon John, former band leader at the Dew Drop Inn, told Arena: \"The lyrics could be interpreted as gay sex. They're not going to play that on the radio!... And everybody knew, this ain't about ice cream! But the primary reaction from the producer's point of view was, 'Hey, this sounds like a hit record.'\" Producer \"Bumps\" Blackwell said: \"I asked him did he have a grudge against making money? He said, 'No.' I said, 'Good.' So we wrote the words,'Tutti frutti, oh rooty,' and a girl named Sue and a girl named Daisy, put Richard on the piano, and in 15 minutes I think we cut two or three cuts, and it's been history ever since.\" The recording may have been unbeatable, but in the US it wasn't the biggest hit version. The man who introduced the delights of Tutti Frutti to the mainstream was Pat Boone, a squeaky-clean square who specialised in taming rock'n'roll for a mostly white audience. If he had known about the original lyrics at the time, he probably would have been appalled. Boone told Arena: \"What I wanted to sing were songs about love and happiness and all that. That was what they played on the radio back then. Rhythm and blues music was called race music. Here I am, a church-going white kid from Nashville. I knew very little of it. But then when I heard a song by Little Richard called Tutti Frutti, I just flat-out loved it and so I thought, 'I'm going to do my version of it.'\" It sold one million records.

The Peebles Hoard, which had lain undisturbed for 3,000 years before it was discovered in 2020, was acquired by National Museums Scotland (NMS) last year. It comprises more than 500 unusual bronze and organic objects and components, many \"without archaeological parallel anywhere in the world\". NMS senior curator of prehistory Dr Matthew Knight said: \"The Peebles Hoard is truly a one-of-a-kind discovery, and I have never seen anything like the stunning, silver-coloured finish of these Bronze Age objects. They almost glow.\" NMS The true colour of many items was unclear prior to the conservation work The hoard has been described as one of the most significant ever found in the country. Dating from between 1,000 and 800BC, it was allocated to NMS under the Treasure Trove system, with a payment made to the detectorist Mariusz Stepien who found it. NMS said the defining technological characteristic of the Bronze Age was the widespread use and production of bronze - an alloy of copper and tin that is usually a deep golden colour. However, conservation of the Peebles Hoard has revealed rare silver-coloured objects from an era when silver was unknown. Crown Copyright Hundreds of pieces were discovered by a metal detectorist in 2020 Analysis has revealed the colour is the result of high levels of tin on the surface.

Devotees will be allowed to worship the Sacred Tooth Relic today from 12 noon to 5.30 p.m. today (19). The religious observance began yesterday at 2.30 p.m. and concluded at 5:30 p.m., granting thousands the chance to pay homage to the Sacred Relic after a gap of 16 years. Over 100,000 devotees had visited the Sri Dalada Maligawa on the opening day. Many who were unable to worship the Sacred Relic yesterday remained overnight in Kandy in hopes of doing so today. A  Dansala  organized by the Sri Dalada Maligawa for visiting devotees was held last night, with  Diyawadana Nilame  Pradeep Nilanga Dela also in attendance. The  Dansala  served dinner to approximately 35,000 people daily from 7.30 p.m. to 2.00 a.m. A special dining hall capable of accommodating 1,000 people at a time has also been set up. To manage the massive influx of worshippers, three main access routes have been arranged: -From D.S. Senanayake Street to the Sri Dalada Maligawa entrance, -From Rathu Bokkuwa via Sangharaja Mawatha to the main entrance, -From Rathu Bokkuwa via Maligawa Place to the main entrance. Each of these queues had stretched over 4 kilometers by this afternoon (19). In the meantime, special public transport services are in operation for devotees traveling from across the island, including Colombo. Sri Lanka Railways has deployed eight additional daily train services to Kandy, while the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) is running special bus services from several major cities. To ensure public health and safety, the Sri Lanka Public Health Inspectors  Association has deployed nearly 50 public health inspectors daily. Their duties include inspecting food outlets, monitoring garbage disposal, and ensuring adequate drinking water and toilet facilities for devotees. However, authorities noted that some pilgrims had carelessly disposed garbage at various locations in the city. Health officials are urging the public to responsibly dispose of waste in designated areas and help maintain a clean environment. According to reports, the accumulated garbage had been cleared by this morning. The Kandy Municipal Council has taken steps to further improve public health amenities, including expanding toilet facilities. Meanwhile, devotees can access real-time updates on queue status and parking availability through the official police website at www.police.lk.

Malinga, who last played a T20 for Sri Lanka in March 2020, was left out of the squad for the T20 World Cup starting on 17 October. Known for his slingy action and accurate yorkers, Malinga took 390 wickets at an average of 19.68 in 295 games in all T20 cricket - a tally bettered only by Dwayne Bravo, Imran Tahir and Sunil Narine. That included 170 wickets in the Indian Premier League, where Malinga won the title with Mumbai Indians in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019. Malinga, who made his international debut in 2004, is also Sri Lanka's third highest wicket-taker in ODIs with 338. He is the only bowler to take three hat-tricks in ODI cricket, and four wickets in four balls on two occasions. He took 101 wickets at 33.15 in 30 Tests.",

        "content": "Who is Sri Lanka s new president Anura Kumara Dissanayake? 22 September 2024 Share Save Gavin Butler BBC News Share Save Getty Images Anura Kumara Dissanayake positioned himself as a candidate for change Left-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been elected as Sri Lanka s next president after he won the debt-ridden country s first election since its economy collapsed in 2022. The 55-year-old beat off his nearest rival, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, to emerge as the clear winner after a historic second round of counting, which included second-preference votes. Outgoing president Ranil Wikremesinghe trailed in third. It's a remarkable turnaround for a man who won just 3% of the votes in the 2019 election. Dissanayake, who contested as candidate for the National People's Power (NPP) alliance, has drawn increasing support in recent years for his anti-corruption platform and pro-poor policies   particularly in the wake of the country s worst ever economic crisis, which is still having an impact on millions. He will now inherit governance of a nation that is struggling to emerge from the shadow of that crisis, and a populace that is desperate for change. So who is president-elect Anura Kumara Dissanayake? A former Marxist Dissanayake was born on 24 November, 1968 in Galewela, a Sinhala-majority and multi-religious town in central Sri Lanka. Raised as a member of the lower middle-class, he is state school educated, has a degree in physics, and first entered politics as a student around the time when the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement was signed in 1987: an event that would lead to one of Sri Lanka s bloodiest periods. From 1987 to 1989, the Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP) - a Marxist political party with which Dissanayake would later become closely associated - spearheaded an armed revolt against the Sri Lankan government. The insurrectionist campaign, spurred by discontent among the youth of the rural lower and middle classes, precipitated a conflict marked by raids, assassinations and attacks against both political opponents and civilians which claimed thousands of lives. Dissanayake, who was elected to the JVP s central committee in 1997 and became its leader in 2008, has since apologised for the group s violence during this so-called \"season of terror\". \"A lot of things happened during the armed conflict that should not have happened,\" he said in a 2014 interview with the BBC. \"We are still shocked, and shocked that things happened at our hands that should not have happened. We are always deeply saddened and shocked about that.\" The JVP, which currently has just three seats in parliament, is part of the NPP coalition that Dissanayake now heads. Getty Images Supporters listen to Anura Kumara Dissanayake during a campaign rally on 16 September, 2024 A 'different' leader While campaigning for the presidential election, Dissanayake addressed another violent moment in Sri Lanka s recent history: the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings. On 21 April 2019, a succession of deadly blasts tore through churches and international hotels across the capital Colombo, killing at least 290 people and injuring hundreds more in what quickly became the worst attack in Sri Lanka s history. Five years later, however, investigations into how the co-ordinated attacks happened, and the security failures that led to them, have failed to provide answers. Some have accused the former government, led by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, of obstructing investigations. In a recent interview with BBC Sinhala, Dissanayake promised he would hold an investigation into the matter if elected   suggesting that authorities had avoided doing so because they were afraid of revealing \"their own responsibility\". It s just one of many unfulfilled promises from Sri Lanka s political elite, he added. \"It s not just this investigation,\" he said. \"Politicians who promised to stop corruption have engaged in corruption; those who promised to create a debt-free Sri Lanka have only worsened the debt burden; people who promised to strengthen the law have broken it. \"This is exactly why the people of this country want different leadership. We are the ones who can provide it.\" A candidate for change Dissanayake was viewed as a strong contender in the lead-up to Saturday s election, positioning himself as the candidate for change against a backdrop of simmering nationwide discontent. Former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was driven out of Sri Lanka in 2022 by mass protests sparked by the economic meltdown. Years of under-taxation, weak exports and major policy errors, combined with the Covid-19 pandemic, dried up the country s foreign exchange reserves. Public debt reached more than $83bn and inflation soared to 70%. Getty Images Sri Lanka's 2022 economic crisis saw people queueing for basic necessities. Two years later, many are still struggling Rajapaksa and his government were blamed for the crisis. And though his successor, President Wickremesinghe, introduced economic reforms that brought down inflation and strengthened the Sri Lankan rupee, people continue to feel the pinch. On a deeper level, the 2022 economic crisis and the circumstances surrounding it   including systemic corruption and political impunity   created demand for a different kind of political leadership. Dissanayake has leveraged that demand to his advantage. He has cast himself as a potential disruptor to a status quo which critics say has long rewarded corruption and cronyism among the political elite. Dissanayake has repeatedly said he plans to dissolve parliament after coming to power, in order to have a clean slate and a fresh mandate for his policies   suggesting in a recent interview with BBC Sinhala that he would do this within days of being elected. \"There is no point continuing with a parliament that is not in line with what the people want,\" he said. An advocate for the poor Among Dissanayake s policy pledges are tough anti-corruption measures, bigger welfare schemes and a promise to slash taxes. Tax hikes and welfare cuts were imposed by the current government as part of austerity measures aimed at steering the country s economy back on track   but they also left many people unable to make ends meet. Dissanayake s promise to rein in those measures appears to have galvanised support among voters, in an election where analysts predicted economic concerns would be front of mind. \"The country's soaring inflation, skyrocketing cost-of-living and poverty have left the electorate desperate for solutions to stabilise prices and improve livelihoods,\" Soumya Bhowmick, an associate fellow at India-based think tank the Observer Research Foundation, told the BBC before the election. \"With the country seeking to emerge from its economic collapse, this election serves as a crucial moment for shaping Sri Lanka s recovery trajectory and restoring both domestic and international confidence in its governance.\" Getty Images Dissanayake's pledges to cut taxes and boost welfare proved popular with voters Some onlookers, including investors and market participants, expressed concern that Dissanayake s economic policies could have an impact on fiscal targets and disrupt Sri Lanka s road to recovery. The presidential candidate tempered his messaging during campaign speeches, however, insisting that he was committed to ensuring repayment of Sri Lanka s debt. He also noted that any changes would be imposed in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has provided a buttress for the country s still-embattled economy. Many analysts think the next president's main task is building a stable economy. Athulasiri Samarakoon, senior lecturer in political science and international studies at the Open University of Sri Lanka, told the BBC that \"the most serious challenge is how to restore this economy\", including managing public expenditure and increasing public revenue generation. \"Any future government will have to work with the International Monetary Fund,\" he noted.

Former MP Duminda Silva was sentenced to death along with four others in 2016 for shooting dead a rival politician and three of his supporters in 2011. Mr Silva, who was a political ally of Mr Rajapaksa, is among 94 prisoners to be given a presidential pardon. Rights activists have reacted angrily. \"It shows complete disdain on the part of the executive for the rule of law, for legal process and for public accountability,\" Ambika Satkunanathan, a human rights lawyer based in Colombo told the BBC. Mr Rajapaksa came to power on a Sinhala nationalist campaign in November 2019. He was the powerful defence secretary when his elder brother, Mahinda, was president from 2005 to 2015. Among those released included 16 people from the minority Tamil community accused of links with the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels. The group was vanquished in a bloody civil war that ended in 2009. Some have been held for more than a decade under the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Colombo-based diplomats and rights activists have welcomed the early release of those held under the anti-terrorism law, which activists describe as draconian. The UN and the US have been pressing Sri Lanka for accountability for alleged war crimes committed during the nearly three-decade old war with the Tamil rebels and to release those held under the PTA. The Sri Lankan government has consistently denied war crime accusations. Allow X content? X s cookie policy privacy policy  accept and continue . This article contains content provided by X .

It was one of the few convictions from the civil war era, and the UN said the pardon was \"an affront to victims\".

The two men were both members of the then governing party. The verdict was later upheld by the country's Supreme Court in 2018. \"Sri Lanka has an accountability problem. Even in the few cases where criminal accountability has been achieved, we see the outcomes undermined by this type of pardon,\" Rory Mungoven, Asia-Pacific chief at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights told the BBC. \"It is not just in relation to human rights cases; this relates to the functioning of the criminal justice system for Sri Lanka as a whole. It is a matter of concern for all Sri Lankans when the rule of law and judicial process are undermined in this way.\" When contacted, the Sri Lankan president's office did not comment further on the pardoning of Mr Silva.

I have written to the president (Mr Rajapaksa) saying he's dragging us to hell,\" Ms Premachandra, also a former MP, said. Hirunika Premachandra said it was no longer possible to trust the judicial system While convicted murderers have been pardoned, activists point out that others, like human rights lawyer Hejaz Hizbullah, have been languishing in jail for months. The former director of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Sri Lanka police, Shani Abeysekara, also spent months in jail. Mr Abeysekara was detained for about 10 months facing accusations that include falsely implicating a fellow officer, who was convicted of murder. He also headed the investigation into Duminda Silva's crime that led to his sentencing in 2016 and other alleged rights abuses during the previous Rajapaksa regime. One of the well-known cases he was following was the disappearance of a political cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda, who left home never to return in early 2010. Mr Ekneligoda was a trenchant critic of the Rajapaksas. Mr Hizbullah has been in prison for more than a year under the PTA anti-terrorism law for alleged involvement in Islamic radicalisation. \"This is an absolute lie and we are determined to prove his innocence in court,\" one of his lawyers said. The European Parliament earlier this month passed a resolution expressing concerns over Sri Lanka's human rights violations. The resolution also urged the European Commission to suspend the duty free access to Sri Lankan goods (known as GSP Plus). The suspension of duty free access will hit hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Sri Lankan exports to the EU, particularly ready-to-wear clothes. This will be a huge setback as Sri Lanka is already facing a major economic challenge due to repeated coronavirus lock downs.",

        "title": "Faith in Chains: The Hijacking of Islam by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan",
        "content": "There is a malicious paradox that still haunts humanity s conscience: one that is concealed in religious jargon that reeks of violence and revenge, in the echo of war screams and the shadow of smoke rising from the wreckage of broken lives. There are those who call themselves fighters for Islam, but assault soldiers and civilians, claim innocence and carry deadly weapons as if they were proud and honorable trophies. Organizations like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in the tribal belt of Pakistan serve as an easy example of such a group of people who violate the religious principles they claim to support. The TTP is one of the longest-lasting instances of terrorism in Pakistan that misinterprets Islam to serve a political purpose. The TTP   a group that emerged from the tribal belt following the US takeover of Afghanistan   aimed to impose its own twisted interpretation of Sharia, which not only targeted state institutions but also innocent citizens, schools, polio workers and religious minorities   actions that directly conflict with Islamic teachings. The TTP does not have political grievances or seek regional independence like many other militant groups; instead, it explicitly uses violence as a religious obligation. This makes its misuse of Islamic principles particularly significant and relevant to consider within the context of faith-based radicalization. The TTP s extremist rhetoric employs religious language to justify violence, and it remains crucial to return to the true meaning of Islam to counter these distorted terrorist ideologies. Religion was never the reason The reason behind such extremist groups is rooted in political and psychological systems and stems greatly from being uninformed and depressed. Research into poverty, conflict and development in Pakistan has shown that poverty can lead to radicalization of beliefs. Such research demonstrates that financial and social problems, rather than religious beliefs, create a prime environment for joining an extremist group. When young people are deprived of hope, education and opportunities, they become impressionable and vulnerable. This creates space for terrorists to exploit. Instead of being guided by genuine religious teachings, these youths are fed anger and resentment, dressed up as devotion to God. Through such manipulation, acts of violence are sanctified in their eyes, legitimizing revenge and sacrifice as something sacred. An Iranian study on the resurgence of the TTP shows that this group, which continues to inspire radical extremists today, did so by abandoning all principles of kindness, fairness and moderation established in Islam. They became notorious for their rigidity, rejecting any differences and excluding Muslims from their community for the slightest reasons. The current TTP has persisted in these wrongdoings and only intensified them. Their cruelty is driven by fanaticism, which disregards the mercy at the core of Islam. Authentic Islamic teachings never condone such actions Religion, according to the Holy Qur an (the central religious text of Islam) and the teachings of the founder of Islam, Prophet Muhammad, has nothing to do with violence; it is never linked to fire and bullets. In fact, in Islam, spreading fitnah   discord and strife   is considered among the gravest of evils. In the Qur an s Surah Al-Ma idah, verse 5:32, it is said clearly:  Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land, it is as if he had slain mankind entirely.  If a life is taken, it is as if a whole universe is lost. Islam holds the sanctity of life in the highest regard. But these extremist groups change the meaning of holy words, isolate parts of scripture and mislead people to support their bloodthirsty actions. While pretending to believe, terrorists work to control the community by threatening them. Terrorism only reveals the low moral values of those who commit it. They claim to seek justice, yet in reality, they just cause more destruction and ruin. In Islam, justice is not pursued through violence and guns; instead, its advocates seek justice by using respectful procedures, kindness and honesty. Several Islamic sources (like the Sirah and Hadith collections) recount that when the Prophet Muhammad faced deep persecution in Mecca, through mockery, boycott and attempts on his life, he showed restraint and entrusted justice to God. After the Muslim victory in 630 CE, known as the Conquest of Makkah, he marked his triumph not with revenge but with a general amnesty, forgiving long-standing enemies. He spoke the famous words,  Go, for you are free.  If violence is justified in the name of religion, it becomes even more dangerous because the perpetrators believe their actions carry divine approval. The Qur an, however, repeatedly stresses that peace should be the foremost goal for Muslims. If there is conflict between groups of believers, Surah Al-Hujurat, verse 49:9, advises them to find a solution.  If two groups among the believers should fight, then make a settlement between them. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the command of Allah.  This verse does not promote rebellion or terrorism. It commands one to pursue peace and justice in accordance with moral and rightful conduct. Terrorism rejects human dignity No matter the claims made, terrorism is an inhumane act that betrays the religion it purports to uphold. Supposed martyrdom achieved through killing, taking pleasure in spilling blood or committing suicide attacks are not acts of true faith; they demonstrate a lack of courage. Revenge against innocent individuals holds no honor, and hatred brings only further suffering. True strength lies in self-control, in the capacity to forgive those who deserve retribution and in helping others rather than spreading terror. The actions of groups like the TTP contradict Islamic principles rather than represent them. Every bomb detonated and bullet fired distances people from the message of peace that Islam carries. Jihad, in its true Islamic context, symbolizes  struggle  in the path of Allah, embodying the efforts to lead a virtuous life and to do better, making jihad a holy act. But instead of using the actual spiritual context, TTP has radicalized jihad by sowing chaos, confusion and suffering. Efforts should extend beyond security measures to reclaim the true perception of Islam. Communities, and especially the young, must be guided toward the religion s authentic teachings, which emphasize life over death and faith over fear. They should learn that prayer, compassion, and peace are stronger than violence, even in the face of oppression. Organizations like TTP are fueled by secrecy, lack of knowledge, fear and division. The antidote is light. Light in our minds, light in how we treat others, and the knowledge that Islam is indeed a religion of peace. Choosing mercy over revenge requires real strength; resisting hatred is far more powerful than fire. Fire doesn t match the strength of faith.

The event began in the US in the 1920s, and has been recognised in the UK throughout October since 1987, as a way of sharing, celebrating and understanding the impact of black heritage and culture. \"It's very important to know where we are coming from and where we are going,\" said Glen Crooks, who runs Glen's Kitchen out of St Pauls Learning Centre in Bristol. \"Black history should be taught all the time, not just in a month,\" he added. A free exhibition focusing on 500 years of black music in Britain will take place between 13-31 October at the centre. Glens Kitchen Glen's Kitchen in Bristol was featured on the BBC's Remarkable Places to Eat series Mr Crooks moved to England in 1967 to be with his mother after being raised by his grandmother in Jamaica. He said while growing up he was not taught about campaigners such as Martin Luther King or Paul Bogle. \"We are coming from a long, long way from slavery. As black people we've been through a lot but we still come out strong,\" he said. Elsewhere in Bristol, a pop up exhibition called Bristol Bus Boycott X, which marks 60 years of the Race Relations Act 1965, will be on show at the Vestibules under City Hall until 17 October, before moving to Sparks Bristol, Wills Memorial Building and the M Shed. Other events in Bristol can be found here.

Mr Campbell said he became a visual activist after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis by police officer Derek Chauvin. The event five years ago led to nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. Mr Campbell said: \"I remember being angry and upset and asking what am I supposed to do?\" He has since photographed more than 100 protests around the world. Mr Campbell said he believed \"education is key\", commenting that in rural areas \"if there are people willing to learn and understand about sections of society they weren't aware of in the past, that's great\". The photographer will be in conversation on 14 October at the Shoemakers Museum. Meanwhile, the actor and author Paterson Joseph will be at Westlands in Yeovil on 24 October speaking about his book Ten Children Who Changed The World, as part of Yeovil Literary Festival. Here are some more Black History Month events taking place in Somerset. Florence Nyasamo Florence Nyasamo said often there is too much focus on the past during Black History Month Florence Nyasamo, the founder of Lives of Colour in Cheltenham, said the month was important for celebrating the local community. Lives of Colour works with businesses, local authorities and schools advising on diversity initiatives and inclusion training. In 2024's Black History Month, the organisation launched a year-long programme of educational events, including students debating race equity and inclusivity in council decision-making. \"The focus is always in the past, Martin Luther King, Mandela, but what about the spaces we live in?,\" said Ms Nyasamo. \"What contributions are communities making? Because this is what will make this visible and why this conversation is important.\" Having moved to the UK 30 years ago from Kenya, Ms Nyasamo said the proudest moment of her life was when she helped arrange for Gloucestershire County Council to fly the pan African flag outside its office. Also during Black History Month, a new adaptation of William Shakespeare's Richard II will be performed in a Southern African Township theatre style at Swindon Arts Centre on 25 October. The play features an original score of Zimbabwean music and song. Elsewhere in Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire, libraries are promoting literature by black authors during October.

        "title": "'Paintings were suddenly seen as money': The reason art heists exploded in the 1970s",
        "content": "Acclaimed new film The Mastermind, starring Josh O'Connor, tells the story of an art robbery gone wrong. It's inspired by a wave of similar thefts during a decade known for upheaval. In May 1972, two men walked into the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts and hurried out carrying four paintings by Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso and a supposed Rembrandt (now believed to be the work of one of his students), holding a group of visiting high school students at gunpoint and shooting a security guard in the process. With the stolen artworks' worth tallying up to $2m ( 1.5m), the New York Times ranked it among \"the largest art robberies in modern times\". Some say it even inspired a far more famous crime nearby: the 1990 heist at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, in which $500m ( 370m) of art was looted, making it the costliest theft in US history full stop, with the crime remaining unsolved. The Worcester heist was orchestrated by career criminal Florian \"Al\" Monday, but the game was up after the two thieves he hired for the raid boasted about their exploits in their local bar. Within a month, the paintings were safely retrieved from a pig farm in Rhode Island and returned to the gallery. \"Ironically, Monday   before he was an art thief   had a band, and I have the 45 of his record,\" writer-director Kelly Reichardt tells the BBC. Her new film The Mastermind, which is released in the US this weekend, is loosely inspired by the chain of events that followed the Worcester robbery, as well as the wave of art heists that followed over the course of that decade. Mubi New film The Mastermind centres on middle-class art school drop-out turned robber JB (played by Josh O'Connor) (Credit: Mubi) Praised by The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw for locating \"the unglamour in the heist\", Reichardt's thoughtful art crime caper dismantles the usual rules of the glitzy, sensationalised heist movie. Blockbusters have long popularised the idea that there is something classy about this category of crime, particularly when it involves art: think, for example, of the 1999 version of The Thomas Crown Affair, in which Pierce Brosnan plays a very suave billionaire orchestrating a raid on New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.",

I wouldn't want to be lynched in northern Scotland.\" Tourists were unfazed. One woman insisted she had \"distinctly\" seen the Monster during her visit.

The modern monster myth began in 1933 with a rather reluctant eyewitness. One sunny spring day, hotel manager Aldie Mackay spotted something unusual in the water. It wasn't until 50 years later that she chose to give her first radio interview, on the BBC's The World This Weekend. Mackay said that the loch's surface had been calm   \"it looked as if you'd gone over it with an iron\"   when suddenly the thing emerged. \"It was so unusual that you just didn't believe what you were seeing. It just came up; it might have been an elephant, it might have been a whale, it might have been anything. It was big and black and shiny because it was wet. It went out into the loch, turned round in a swirl and just disappeared.\" Having been more than aware of the local monster folklore   \"you read all the stories of kelpies and things\"   she said she laughed to herself that \"this is the beast, but I don't believe it\".",

        "content": "Sixty years ago, anthology series Out of the Unknown premiered on the BBC. It served up serious, one-off sci-fi dramas exploring our relationship with technology, among other things. In a crowded TV landscape, few shows have carved out as distinct a niche as Black Mirror, Netflix's anthology sci-fi series comprised of individual, standalone dramas, all dealing with the dark side of modernity and technological progress. But while it may be strikingly different from anything else out there now, it's certainly not unique within TV history. In fact, you can see its roots all the way back in a classic British sci-fi show celebrating its 60th anniversary this month. Airing on the BBC between 1965 and 1971, and re-released on DVD in 2014 by the British Film Institute, Out of the Unknown was a cultural outlier. While there were various sci-fi shows on British and US TV at the time, they mostly offered escapism, such as Doctor Who (1963-89) and Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's various serials like Stingray (1964-65) and Thunderbirds (1965). Out of the Unknown's aim was more elevated: it set out to tell sci-fi tales that explored serious, adult subjects such as war, politics and technology, and mixed original scripts with adaptations of stories by celebrated authors like John Wyndham, Ray Bradbury and JG Ballard. Like the best sci-fi, it also managed to depict imagined futures while really commenting on the fears and tensions facing the world at the time of its production. BFI/ BBC One of the show's most remarkable episodes, an adaptation of EM Forster's The Machine Stops, foresaw the internet age (Credit: BFI/ BBC) In this respect and others, the parallels with Black Mirror are clear although there is an irony to this comparison. \"I have to confess I haven't seen it!\" Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker tells the BBC. \"The inspiration for Black Mirror really came from Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone, and lots of slightly odd BBC single dramas like [Nigel Kneale's] The Stone Tape and The Year of the Sex Olympics. I'm definitely riffing on work directly connected to [Out of the Unknown], yet I haven't seen it. It's interesting!\"",

        "content": "Rome has many great spectacles below street leve and the latest are the underground chambers and passageways at the Colosseum, due to open to the public from late August 2010. Rome s Colosseum (Piazza del Colosseo) just got even more interesting. The great 80,000-capacity stadium, where the masses used to bay for blood at free spectacles involving gladiators, wild beasts and those unlucky enough to get on the wrong side of the Empire, is due to open its underground passageways to the public from late August 2010. This part of the building was where the afternoon's entertainment used to cower pre-performance. It will be accessible through the back entrance once used by gladiators, with a new glass lift sinking down into the bowels of the building. The architect in charge of the project, Barbara Nazzaro, says that visitors will be able to see where the lions, tigers, bulls, ostriches and gazelles were kept in cells before being hoisted up on 80 rope-slung lifts to the ground floor. This process was a remarkable theatrical device, as the wild beasts used to appear as if out of nowhere onto the stage. Gladiators and scenery were also hoisted up in the same way. The elephants, however, were too heavy to be lifted up, so used to make their grand entrance through the main gates. This is a building that has until now been rather more impressive from the outside, but the opening of the underground sections means that visitors will be able to envisage the entertainments held here from a new, if chilling perspective. The other new section of the building that will be opening shortly is the highest part of the remaining seating, allowing spectacular views across the stadium. Rendering visits even more spookily evocative, the Colosseum is open till midnight on Saturdays from 21 August to the 23 October 2010. Rome has numerous other places where it is possible to explore underground, and perhaps nowhere sums up this multi-layered city more perfectly than St Clemente (Via di San Giovanni in Laterano). This is a 12th-Century church, lined with a shimmering apse mosaic. But it is discovering the staircase down to the next layer of history that makes this Rome's most extraordinary church. The steep staircase down leads to a 4th-Century church, decorated with fading frescoes. Yet something even more mystical and mysterious lies beneath: the next staircase down leads to a Roman house and pagan temple, complete with altar showing Mithras killing a bull. And echoing through the ancient temple is the sound of a river flowing even beneath this layer, running through a Republic-era drain. Rome's other great underground adventure lies out near the Appia Antica, to the southeast of town. Here are the catacombs, where Christians used to bury their dead, in a kind of warren-like after-dead ghetto outside the city walls. The most famous are the Catacombs of San Callisto (Via Appia Antico 110 & 126), the first official cemetery after the Roman Catholic church was founded at the end of the 2nd Century. This spider's web of narrow tunnels, complete with coffin-sized cavities, opens out into dark subterranean churches - a most evocative way to end an underground tour of Rome. The article 'Going underground at the Colosseum' was published in partnership with Lonely Planet.",

        "content": "In the towns along the Golden Ring bells ring out from towering belfries, robed holy men scurry through church doors and historic tales recall mysterious, magical times. A journey around the Golden Ring retraces Russian history back to the beginning. This is the clutch of towns northeast of Moscow where ancient Rus grew into the Russian nation. In many cases, the whitewashed walls of these once-fortified cities still stand and the golden spires and onion domes of their monasteries still puncture the sky. Bells ring out from towering belfries; robed holy men scurry through church doors; historic tales recall mysterious, magical times. Day 1: Vladimir About 175km east from Moscow, your first stop is Vladimir, which was the seat of the throne in the 12th Century. High up on the slope above the Klyazma River sits the solemnly majestic Assumption Cathedral, built to announce Vladimir's claim as capital of Rus. Spend an hour admiring the detailed carving and the 15th Century frescoes painted by Russia's foremost icon painters, before retiring to the quaint and comfortable Monomakh Hotel. Day 2: Suzdal Drive 35km north to the enchanting village of Suzdal. The winding Kamenka River, flower-drenched meadows and dome-spotted skyline make this medieval capital a perfect fairytale setting. Peeking over the Kremlin walls are the star-spangled domes of the village's oldest church, the Nativity of the Virgin Cathedral (AD1220-onwards). A walk along the earthen ramparts reveals a veritable medieval wonderland with magnificent views of three monasteries, two convents and some thirty smaller churches. Afterwards, you can dine at the Kremlin refectory (trapeznaya), which has been serving delicious food for centuries. Day 3: Kostroma Get up early for the 173km drive to the northernmost point on the Golden Ring. Kostroma was founded in 1152, but the historic centre dates to the 18th Century, when the old wooden structures were demolished by fire. Spend the afternoon exploring the 14th Century Monastery of St Ipaty, which poses on the right bank of the Kostroma River. Exhibits are dedicated to the young boyar Mikhail Romanov, who was in exile here when he was elected tsar, thus launching the dynasty. Spend the night at the aptly named Hotel Volga, a Soviet-era establishment offering timeless river views. Day 4: Yaroslavl About 76km west, this is the namesake of Kyivan prince Yaroslav the Wise, who founded the town in 1010. His statue overlooks the town square, opposite the formidable 12th Century Monastery of the Transfiguration of the Saviour. Stroll along the banks of the Volga River and discover the myriad merchant churches, most of which date to the city's 17th Century heyday as a trading centre. Take a break to recover at an outdoor cafe along the quaint cobblestone pedestrian street ulitsa Kirova. Day 5: Rostov-Veliky Drive about 60km south along the road headed back to Moscow. Founded in 862, Rostov \"the Great\" gives the impression of a sleepy village, spread out along the shore of the Lake Nero. From the dusty streets rise the white-washed walls and shiny domes of the Kremlin, a relic of the 12th Century, when Rostov was the seat of the Grand Prince. Climb up into the fortress walls, from where you can also enter the unusual gate-churches. Keep your ears pealed for a bell concert, which the resident monks play from the belfry of the Assumption Cathedral.",

        "content": "The iconic skyscraper has the highest and best views in the city, its history is revelatory and makeovers to the lobby and observatories deserve a fresh look. It is so obvious, so clich  and so visible that visiting the Empire State Building gets, ironically, overlooked. Like the single slice meal, blue Yankee cap and yellow cab, the skyscraper is in the city s DNA, so familiar you feel as if you have been there even if you have never stepped foot on the observation deck. Or maybe you have written it off as an over-priced tourist trap, which is not entirely off-base. But as the gray monolith turns 80 years old on May 1, it is worth giving it a second   or first   try. The Empire State Building inspires the imagination, its views are the highest and best in the city, its history revelatory, and makeovers to the lobby and observatories deserve a fresh look. All you need to do is avoid the headaches and traps of a visit so that nothing detracts from the marvel. Avoiding the lines There are four famously-lengthy lines (tickets, security, elevator up, elevator down) but there are just as many ways to avoid them. You can visit during more predictably crowd-free times, particularly between the 8 am opening and the pre-lunch rush, and after midnight until the 2 am close. For other times, call ahead. I scored a lineless visit on a Wednesday just before sunset by calling 212-736-3100 and asking for the wait time. If the estimate exceeds your patience you can purchase an Express Ticket for $24 extra and get the velvet rope treatment at the front of each line. Or, for only a $2 online fee, you can at least buy and print out the normal ticket in advance and avoid the ticket line, which is often the longest. With those hurdles leapt you are free to enjoy the gleaming lobby, nearly half a block of prime Art Deco design. The illuminated celestial-meets-industrial scene of gold and aluminium leaf spheres and lines, modern by 1930s standards, had been obscured for decades by florescent lights that were modern by '60s standards. Its recreated glory, accomplished by historical architects and artisans, is classic Gotham. It left me feeling woefully underdressed without a fedora and pinstripe suit. The bar The Empire Room, an old-school-styled cocktail lounge of mohair, velvet, ebony and embossed leather that opened last year, extends that retro feel. The vibe is reminiscent of the early '60s-set television show Mad Men, though the soundtrack alternated between appropriate Harry Connick Jr tunes and mood-shattering Sade and Queen remixes. The cocktail menu includes classics such as the Ramon Gin Fizz, Waldorf and Martinique Daisy, all elaborately and proficiently executed. The bar's signature drink is a sweet, bubbly variation on the Empire State Cocktail -- gin, vermouth, Royal Combier Liqueur, lemon juice and raspberry-orange marmalade crowned tableside in a chilled martini glass with Moet & Chandon champagne. As an aside to the bartender shaking mine out, one pearl-necklaced hostess characterized the concoction as \"stupid\". And while it is an admittedly convoluted, fruity concoction Don Draper would not be caught dead sipping, the champagne was a nice addition to the classic recipe. It gave me a fizzy rush that aped the ascent of the building's dizzying height.",

        "content": "Ancient Vijayanagara, a crumbling 16th-century metropolis, is a stark contrast to the decadence of Goa s beach life. Once the hippie paradise of the sixties, Goa s beautiful beaches are now overrun with endless hawkers and techno music. Last year, the Indian state broke its own tourism record. But just beyond the tourist trappings of the tightly packed beachfront development, lie the ruins of the opulent former southern capital of the spice trade. Ancient Vijayanagara, now known as the village of Hampi, is just a day's drive from the Goan chill-out scene. It is a stark contrast to the decadence of beach life. The rice fields and coconut plantations drop away into vast expanses of arid farmland, worked by men dressed in dhoties, driving oxen in their bare feet. Granite boulders litter the landscape, in hues of gold, pink and grey, a rocky backdrop to the sprawling ruins. The entire city was ransacked in the 16th Century, leaving behind one of the most important cultural and religious monuments in the region. This crumbling metropolis was once one of the most beautiful cities in its time. Today it is one of the most impressive ruins. This is why you go to India. Where to start? Most people stay in the area known as Hampi Bazaar, which is situated beside the main temple (Virupaksha), or they venture out to the neighbouring town of Hospet. The scale of Vijayanagara is not to be underestimated (26 square km of ruins), especially in the midday heat, so it is advisable to rent a bike, motorbike or hire a rickshaw driver as you cruise from temple to temple -- although it is possible to walk. The perfect two-day exploration The best way to quickly grasp the magnitude of Hampi is to hike Mantanga hill, preferably at sunrise for the best views. Stone steps are carved into the hillside and while it is the only way to experience the full gestalt of the city, it is still hard to imagine how invading Muslims could have spent six months attacking and pillaging the once thriving capital of 500,000 people. The comparison between what must have been and what exists today is a constant part of the experience in Hampi. From there, head to the main river that cuts through the town, the Tungabhadra, to watch pilgrims and locals bathe down by the ghats. Every morning at around eight, the loveliest thing happens. The temple elephant, Lakshmi, carefully lumbers down the long stairs to the river and blesses the pilgrims with a spray of water before receiving her morning bath. It takes about an hour to scrub her down and she lays on her side, poking her trunk up out of the water and adjusting her ears to allow her handlers better access.",

In the remote countryside of central Vietnam, archaeologists discovered the \"longest monument in Southeast Asia\", a wall that winds through pristine, rain-forested mountains and hill tribe villages, yet still unspoiled by the imminent arrival of busloads of tourists. Find of the century Earlier this year, Vietnam's most important archaeological discovery in a century was announced by Dr Andrew Hardy, head of the Hanoi branch of  cole fran aise d'Extr me-Orient (French School of Asian Studies) and Dr Nguyen Tien Dong, from the Institute of Archaeology (Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences). The rampart stretches 127.4 km from northern Quang Ngai Province, south into the province of Binh Dinh, and is the greatest engineering feat of the Nguyen Dynasty. The Long Wall of Quang Ngai, as it is now known, is made of alternating sections of stone and earth, is believed to have been built in 1819 as a cooperative effort between the Vietnamese and H're ethnic minority. Much like Hadrian's Wall in the United Kingdom, Quang Ngai's wall was also built along an ancient, pre-existing road, and not only provided security but also regulated trade along the route. Most of the wall is still in relatively good condition, attaining heights up 4 metres. Quang Ngai today Until now, Quang Ngai was seldom visited by tourists, apart from stops at the Son My Memorial Museum, site of the infamous wartime My Lai Massacre. The province remained politically sensitive as a result of those tragic events, and as such, travel by outsiders through the countryside was somewhat restricted. Since the initial discovery of the wall in 2005, Quang Ngai has slowly opened up. Several independent travellers have now ventured to see the wall since its existence was announced earlier this year. Quang Ngai City, the provincial capital, is a suitable base from which visitors can reach the wall. Apart from the city's only four-star hotel, Central Hotel, near the river, the city lacks anything approaching luxury accommodation. Dining is mostly street food and local specialties like ram bap (corn spring rolls), ron (tiny river clam soup) and ca bong song tra (Song Tra River mudskipper fish). As no major tour companies have offices in Quang Ngai yet, transportation consists of Mai Linh taxis (one of the few legal and reliable companies) and motorbikes for hire.",

The site of the Civil War's most famous battle, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania has historic events year round, but this month kicks off a five-year commemoration with expanded programs and tours, special observances and the opening of a new museum. From April through October there will be living history encampments at several places around town. \"Kids can walk up and talk to soldiers -- Union and Confederate -- and ask about what they are wearing or what they are cooking for dinner,\" Mr Whitehill said. \"There will be large battle re-enactments and smaller skirmishes in the streets. That's one of the things we do best here.\" In Manassas, Virginia, \"cannons boom and rifles crackle\" too, as the pivotal Battle of First Manassas is recreated in July, but visitors to the area can also watch crafts demonstrations, listen to live music and learn dances of the Civil War era.

Travel back more than 700 years ago to Acre, and sample the delights of a cosmopolitan crusader outpost before it falls to the Mamluks, and get tips on visiting the present day Israeli city. When to go The Mamluk sultan of Egypt and Syria, Baybars Bunduqdari, has agreed a truce with the Christian forces in Outremer. Act now and take advantage of our incredible peacetime offers. The Christians may have lost Jerusalem back in 1244, but Acre has become the crusaders' hip and happening capital. Acre boasts a safe harbour and markets galore, and it's a veritable melting pot of races and religions. You never know who you might meet around the next corner: assassin or merchant, Knight Templar or slave trader. The truce has been agreed for ten years and ten months, but who knows what will happen when it ends, so don't delay - book today! What to take with you A decent pair of shoes are essential if you take the overland route across Christendom, then down through Anatolia and Cilicia - though frankly that's so First Crusade. Besides, all the cities worth looting, such as Constantinople, have already been pillaged by your forefathers, so we highly recommend a sea crossing in this day and age. It's peacetime so you shouldn't need a weapon, but you might find a broadsword comforting if you can afford one - the threat of internecine war is never far away in this multicultural port. Costs and money Another good reason to book now is that your stay will be more economically viable in peacetime. Trade is thriving, with the Italian maritime republics selling arms and timber for siege engines to the Mamluks in Egypt - and the markets are overflowing with produce, meaning a lower risk of profiteering. Don't forget: during the siege of Acre by the crusaders at the end of the 12th century the price of a sack of grain rose to 100 gold pieces and many besiegers had to live on horse entrails and bark. This might be fine if you're French, but since our delicate British stomachs can't even cope with raw fruit, you'd be strongly advised to give this siege cuisine a wide berth. See Take a stroll down the vaulted streets and covered marketplaces in the Pisan and Venetian quarters and marvel at the wares: indigo from Iraq, glass from Egypt, perfume from Syria, or sugar from Acre's own factory. Smell the aromas of a thousand spices, eye the poisons on display, hear the many languages being shouted by traders. If shopping isn't your thing then head outside the walls and wander through the gardens and orchards, or take a day trip to the Springs of the Oxen, where Adam is said to have found the beasts with which to plough the earth.

But walk the path for any distance, and as the wall unfolds in front of you, it reveals a past that was also epic, poignant and strange. I d begun my walk the day before, heading east from Lanercost in Cumbria. It s my plan to walk the 40-mile stretch to Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland over four days. I set off early in the morning as a man called Maurice brings out the honesty box from his shed to set beside his bag of home-grown apples. Munching on one of Maurice s apples as I walk past the first standing remnant of the wall at Hare Hill, I find it hard to reconcile the peaceful atmosphere around me with what I know of the region s history. Ripe sloes and crab apples line the path that runs along green pasture where sheep and cattle graze happily in the soft rain. Hadrian ordered the construction of his wall in 122 AD;  to separate the Romans from the barbarians , his biographer wrote. It stretched in its heyday from coast to coast, with a pair of turrets and a  castle  or small fort every mile, and deep earthworks on either side. Larger forts, some of which predated the wall, garrisoned the troops and housed their dependants. Until antiquarians began to realise the significance of Hadrian s Wall and fought to preserve it in the 19th century, it was pillaged by locals for building material. Along its length, farmhouses that have been built out of Roman masonry still sit next to denuded sections of the wall. All the same, according to Richard Hingley, a Durham archaeologist who s writing a biography of the wall, locals never entirely forgot its importance. It helped define the border between England and Scotland. And as early as the 16th century, local landowners were collecting stones from the wall to display in their gardens. Nowadays, much of the wall is gone; sections of it are no more than dots and dashes of stonework. At the eastern edge of the route, slabs of wall turn up incongruously in Tyneside housing estates. Every now and again, you come upon a stretch that is sufficiently intact to give you a sense of what it must have been like during the centuries when it was Rome s northern frontier. Ruts cut by hundreds of years of wagon wheels can be seen in the stone gateways of forts. Here and there are stones carved by the soldiers to commemorate the completion of their work:  the cohort of Primus Pilus built this  scratched into a stone, or a phallus etched into a limestone block to propitiate a forgotten god.",

There is an old story about Lenin, set in the gilded splendour of a caf  somewhere in Central Europe, sometime in the early 20th Century. A pair of distinguished old gentlemen are discussing affairs of state over steaming cups of coffee and slices of cake.  There s talk of revolution,  says one, moustache quivering.  Any day now, they say.  \"Revolution!\" scoffs the second, cocking his thumb at the next table, where a scrawny young man with a goatee beard and flat cap is scribbling furiously in a notebook. \"And who's going to lead it - him???\" The tale is almost certainly apocryphal. But sitting in Prague's art deco Caf  Imperial, scooping the whipped cream off a v de sk  k va (Viennese coffee), it is an evocative fantasy. The future Soviet leader did visit Prague, in 1912. In fact, it was at the Prague Party Conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, held just around the corner in Hybernsk  street, that his Bolshevik faction broke away from the Mensheviks for good, with untold consequences for humanity. Unfortunately the Imperial was not built until 1914, so there goes the Lenin theory. But with its creamy tiles and Moorish mosaics, it is still a great place to sit and watch the world - and the trams - go by, though the prices are no longer revolutionary. Like many Prague coffee houses, the Caf  Imperial has undergone something of a makeover in recent years. Gone is the dark and dismal interior, the indifferent service, and - a terrible shame this - the legendary doughnut bowl, whose stale contents could once be bought and pelted at fellow patrons for exactly 1,942 Czech crowns (just over 100 dollars), a homage to an incident in the classic 1942 novel Saturnin, a sort of Czech Jeeves and Wooster. The Imperial is one of a handful of the great pre-war caf s - temples to caffeine, creativity and conversation - left in Prague. You wll find two of the most famous on the city's N rodn  street. The first, Caf  Louvre, boasts a beautifully-preserved interactive map in the marbled lobby, displaying the unfeasibly long list of caf s (160!) that served the Czech capital before war, Communism and Starbucks intervened. Each is marked with a little bulb that lights up when you press a button. Most, sadly, are long gone. But the Louvre, with its pastel pink decor and excellent sweet trolley, survives to this day, its genteel ambience unchanged since 1911, when Einstein, then a visiting professor, would pop in for a piece of strudel.",

And you don t have to bring coins   in fact, watch out for speculative money changers. It s better to bring uncoined silver or other goods to barter, because you will want to make your offerings to the gods for good luck   and maybe buy your own private water supply too. Sleep You shouldn t expect 5-star accommodation at any price, unless you happen to be a VIP, an ambassador or someone like that. Do remember there could be as many as 40,000 of you crammed together in a small space at the height of summer   darlings, the smell FUN AND (THE) GAMES But every four years, at the second full moon after the summer solstice, Olympia itself   as well as the athletes of course   really jumps. If you arrive a bit early, you can watch potential competitors in training, hoping to be selected for their chosen events on the big day. The full programme includes sprint and middle distance running, the  heavy  events: boxing, wrestling, all-in fighting; and field events: discus, javelin, doesn t even bear thinking about. So whatever you do, don t forget the aryballos (perfume-fl ask) or sponge. Eat and drink But there will be compensations, believe me, many and various. Lots of temporary stall holders offering sweetmeats and alcoholic beverages, not to mention other more, shall we say, fleshly delights. (When I said  no women allowed , I meant no free Greek citizen women, naturally). See Some of you may have already visited Olympia off-season. To you I say that you are in for a big surprise. Some of the buildings are lovely, no doubt, any year, any time of year   the temple of Hera, for instance (but it so needs a temple to the patron god Zeus to go with it, don t you think?), and there are lots of gorgeous statues to gaze at. But frankly there s not a lot else to do   apart from consult Zeus s oracle, say, or pay your pious respects to the host of other gods and heroes who have their shrines and altars here. Fun and (the) games But every four years, at the second full moon after the summer solstice, Olympia itself   as well as the athletes of course   really jumps. If you arrive a bit early, you can watch potential competitors in training, hoping to be selected for their chosen events on the big day. The full programme includes sprint and middle distance running, the  heavy  events: boxing, wrestling, all-in fighting; and field events: discus, javelin, long-jump. All the competitors are stark naked too   gymnasia are just what they say they are:  stark-naked training-grounds . And on top of all that there are the equestrian events: horseracing, mule-cart racing, chariot-racing. With any luck you might see a spectacular chariot wreck. Of course the equestrian events are only for the rich   who sponsor the teams, the jockeys and the drivers. They don t actually compete in person, but they get lots of kudos anyway. Poor boys can do very well in the running or boxing, mind you   and can then cash in on their success later on. But remember that all that victors at Olympia win is a symbolic prize of a crown of wild olive. You, though, will make heroes of them and you can rub shoulders with them in the huge parade and animal-sacrifice at Zeus s massive ash-altar that mark the festival s central act of communion between gods and men. Getting around When you get home   by mule-cart for some of you, on horseback for the lucky few, but for most on foot   you can worship the victors, literally, as superhuman heroes. That is even (or especially) if they ve got themselves killed, in the all-in fighting or whatever. Errosthe (fare well)! Visiting Olympia today One of the most delightful of Greece s ancient sites, Olympia is today a day trip from Athens. That it is a glorious one rather than a hot, underwhelming slog is to do with two things: the efforts locals and firefighters made in 2007 to save the site from bush fires, and the ruins themselves.",

        "content": "Stonehenge is the most famous of the 1,000 stone circles across Britain. Explore two more historic stone circles in Orkney and Cumbria. Stonehenge is, for many of us, the one place that represents Britain s prehistory. The celebrated stone circle standing proud on Salisbury Plain with its trademark lintel-topped sarsens has been an enduring source of fascination for millennia. The first monument there, a circular ditch and bank, was dug in c2900 BC, and a timber or stone circle erected inside it. Then, much later, in c2400 BC, the first monoliths of local rock were brought in. Over the course of the next several hundred years, stones were put up, taken down, moved around, added to, and then finally re-erected to the shape we see today. Stonehenge is undeniably a stone circle, but it's not a henge, even though it has lent its name to the group of monuments that go under that title. The concept of the 'henge' was introduced by a man called Thomas Kendrick in 1932 and technically, a henge is a circular earthen bank with a ditch inside it and one or more entrances through the bank. At Stonehenge, there is a circular bank, but it is inside a ditch, so these elements are the wrong way round. Nevertheless, stone circles and henges do appear to be connected parts of a tradition that developed in Britain from around 3000 to 2000 BC - in other words, during the later Neolithic period (when agriculture began here) and moving into the earlier Bronze Age (when we see the first use of metals, from about 2400 BC). Stone circles are often positioned within henges, sometimes in replacement for earlier timber circles, so there is a link between the two types of monument, though it's not an absolutely clear one, as Richard Bradley explains: \"Henges and stone circles are separate things that often coalesce. You've got plenty of stone circles that don't have henges, and plenty of henges that don't have stone circles. They each can pursue an independent existence but they are both different expressions of a more basic idea that special places ought to be circular, which seems quite natural to us, but large parts of Europe don't have circular monuments in prehistory.\"",

Crossroads of the Ancient World uses pieces from Afghanistan, Egypt and India to explore Afghanistan's history as a centre of trade.

Walking through a wintry Harbin is like falling through the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland and landing in a fairytale. The 27th Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival in this north-eastern Chinese city is the biggest ever, an incredible demonstration of the same industrial-scale creativity that was on display at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. The riverfront and streets are lined with hundreds of intricate ice sculptures, including a full-size replica of a Disney castle. At night, lit by multi-coloured lasers and lanterns, the effect is magical. This year's festival also sees Harbin reclaim its past, via a frozen re-creation of the St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church. A legacy of the time before World War II when the city was home to 100,000 Russians, the church was destroyed in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. \"For my parents' generation, that sculpture brings back many memories,\" says Zhang Qingying, a local lawyer. More than a million visitors are expected to attend this year's festival, as Harbin establishes itself as China's winter-sports playground. The nearby ski resort of Yabuli, the country's biggest, is being upgraded and extended, a sign of how China's burgeoning middle classes are increasingly taking to the slopes, while rumour has it that Harbin is a frontrunner to host the 2022 Winter Olympics.

        "content": "Not far from Poland s capital are two historical sites, the Wieliczka salt mine and the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum, both of which transport travelers to a different time. Not far, but worlds away from the unending charm of Krak w, are two of Poland s most cherished sites. Both are Unesco heritage listed. Both attract dense crowds each day and both are portals to alternate realms of experience. The Wieliczka salt mine is 10km from Krak w and descends 327m underground. The Auschwitz-Birkenau museum is 40km from Krak w, and descends into one of the darkest crevices of human history. Wieliczka Salt Mine The Wieliczka Salt Mine is an intricate ant-farm of passages, chambers and underground lakes, distributed over nine levels. Enormous cavities dug or discovered by miners and explorers since the 13th Century interlink to form an underground city with bulging grey boulders for clouds and bible-black tunnels for roads. Less than 1% of the mine's 300km is open for public exploration, but this tiny fraction is large enough to include restaurants, chapels and halls that regularly host balls, art exhibitions, music concerts and even soccer tournaments. The three hour journey through the spooky labyrinth of chambers and corridors begins after a dizzying descent down a wooden scaffold of 380 steps tattooed all over with \"I was here\" scratchings. Down here, internal compasses are thrown off-course. As you clamber up and down skewed staircases and along imperceptible gradients, you lose all sense of how far you are trespassing below normal human habitation. The zenith of the salt mine's underground experience is the Chapel of St Kinga, the first glimpse of which shocks reverence into even the most devout atheist. The intricate details of the altarpieces, frescoes, chandeliers and tiled floors in this 54m long, 12m high place of worship are all the more impressive for having been meticulously hand carved entirely from salt over 30 painstaking years.",

These are the stark realities that confront visitors to sites of genocide, torture and atrocity. The horrors of Nazi concentration camps in Poland or the Khmer Rouge s Killing Fields in Cambodia can be taught in history books, but nothing comes close to the feeling of standing in the very place millions of people fell victim to evil. \"There's something about [it] that draws you into their reality in a way that's vivid and personal,\" said Sara Bloomfield, director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. \"And that just doesn't match any other form of learning... These places teach us that the unthinkable is thinkable,\" she said. Preservation efforts in Poland are currently underway to ensure the protection of the decaying Auschwitz-Birkenau site and its victims' memories. This is good news for the country's tourism industry which sees a great deal of business from both foreign and local visitors to the Nazi death camp. Tourism, though, often brings with it some level of commercialization. In locations of atrocities around the world, tourists and tourism companies must ask themselves: when does tourism walk the line between education and exploitation? Youk Chhang was just a child when he was separated from his family and forced into slave labour in the Killing Fields. Although he and his mother survived the Khmer Rhouge's reign, several of their relatives did not. Chhang now runs the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an organization that works to document the terrors of the Khmer Rouge. \"How can we learn from [this] history... so that it cannot be repeated, if we continue to fail to understand that the memory of those who have died cannot be commercialized?\" he said in an email to BBC Travel. Sites of atrocities, he believes, \"should not be sites to attract tourists, but places for them to learn\". Chhang fears that private companies coming into Cambodia are turning the Killing Fields into \"Disneylands\", as he told the Associated Press in 2006. He worries that resorts and casinos built near these sites may profit from the memory of genocide victims.",

        "content": "Follow young Henry VIII s favourite, and notorious, spots around the city. For centuries, King Henry VIII was mainly remembered as an obese Pope-hater with a penchant for executing anything that moved, especially if it was married to him. But the revival of interest in Tudor-era London, inspired by the success of the recent drama series The Tudors, has also transformed Henry s portly image in unexpected ways. He is now a sex symbol. Jonathan Rhys Meyers's young Henry is a suave lothario, prowling the streets of Tudor London in pursuit of his next mistress. And the city itself, portrayed in the series as a seething cesspit of murder, intrigue and passion, more than lives up to its ruler's charisma. While much has inevitably changed since Henry's reign, the outline of Tudor London is still visible within the sprawl of the modern city. The obvious place to start is at the Tower of London (www.hrp.org.uk/toweroflondon), sitting ominously on the edge of today's financial district. Previously used as a royal residence, Henry transformed it into a death-row prison. His second wife, Anne Boleyn, was executed here in 1536. Visitors can see the royal Crown Jewels and graffiti purported to have been scratched into the wall by the nine-day Queen, Lady Jane Grey, beheaded in 1554. Henry's bloodlust was matched only by his love for opulent palaces. The Thames was lined with the turrets of royal residences, from the Palace of Whitehall - whose only remaining section, the Banqueting House, is at the corner of Horse Guards Avenue (hrp.org.uk/banquetinghouse) - to Hampton Court in Richmond (www.hrp.org.uk/hamptoncourtpalace). Here, no less than five Henry VIII impersonators are on hand to show visitors around the King's Apartments, Tudor kitchens and the notoriously tricky maze. The young Henry's favourite Palace, however, was at Greenwich, where he held lavish parties and jaunting contests. The Palace was demolished in the 17th Century, but its remains continue to be found - a section of the tiled floor of the Tudor chapel was discovered in 2006. Artefacts from the Palace are on display at the \"Discover Greenwich\" visitor centre (www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org/discover-greenwich), which also offers the chance to try on a suit of Tudor armour.",

Even if you do not stay in room 217 where King conceived his classic novel, the hotel offers historical ghost tours every day and even has a paranormal investigator on staff for questions. If the spirits have your hair standing on end, a walk around the grounds can calm the nerves. While you won't find the fictional hedge maze, the hotel's neoclassical architecture and distinctive red roof make a remarkable sight set against the backdrop of Rocky Mountain vistas in every direction.

Hotel Boulderado, Boulder Unlike most historic hotels, the construction of Hotel Boulderado was not a venture of a single tycoon. It was funded by local business owners. Though privately owned today, the Boulderado maintains much of its 1909 look, with antique furniture and the original cherry wood staircase. The hotel even operates its original Otis elevator, which a staff member must manually operate between floors. Past guests include Robert Frost and Helen Keller. Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong also found rooms here in the 1960s when few Boulder hotels accepted black guests.

Some of Boulder's best restaurants and shops call this corridor home and, street performers make light of any afternoon. The Broadmoor, Colorado Springs In 1918, Mining baron Spencer Penrose converted the Broadmoor Gambling Hall into the hotel it is today, hoping to fuse European elegance with frontier hospitality. But Penrose was no stuffy entrepreneur. A fierce anti-prohibitionist, he invited 55 New York hoteliers out west in 1920 and asked them to bring five bottles of their favorite \"cologne\". Today, you can admire Bottle Alley on the lobby level of the hotel and see the remains of what his conspirators imbibed during Prohibition; some bottles have their original dust. The Broadmoor remains dedicated to indulgence, featuring opulent chandeliers, marbled floors and detailed ceiling and wall murals.

        "content": "Travel back in time with stops in a merchant trading port and a historical Swahili city. Most travellers start exploring the coast from Mombasa. Historically, Portuguese, Indian, Persian and Arab traders used this port as their starting point for accessing East Africa. This jumble of merchants and explorers helped create the ethnic mix of Mombasa s population and the physical chaos of the city s layout. Here, a long stretch of Chinese-built concrete boxes; there, a mosque built by a nostalgic imam from Tunis in the style of his North African home; around the way, a series of souks, alleys and cobblestone walkways thick enough for a donkey to pass through, overhung with canvas to protect Gujarati candy merchants and Digo witch doctors from the white equatorial sun. And dominating the entire city is Fort Jesus, a castle made of coral by colonizing Portuguese. Mombasa can be dangerous to walk around after hours, but when the sun rises we recommend eating a breakfast of maharagwe (beans cooked with coconut) and chapatti bread. The ubiquitous foodstuff on the Kenyan coast is a synthesis of local and foreign ingredients. The adventure of the Kenyan coast is unfortunately matched by the ugliest sort of overdevelopment in the form of full-service Swahili-chic resorts. But smart, sustainable tourism projects exist as well, even in places chok-a-block with large hotels like popular Diani Beach. For example, the Colobus Trust (www.colobustrust.org) resembles a jungle playground, overhanging with vines and ropes, all a set piece and sanctuary for the adorable Angolan Black-and-White Colobus monkey. Further south of Diani, Kaya Kinondo (kaya-kinondo-kenya.com) is the protected kaya, or sacred forest, of the local Digo Mijikenda tribe. The forest once housed the Digo, and has been maintained in a virgin state as a centre of their religious and communal ceremonies.",

        "content": "From forts to temples, the island s colonial and Buddhist heritage is rich and varied. Think of Sri Lanka and, aside from images of Tamil Tiger strife, it might be hard to picture anything except palm trees, azure seas and sumptuous white sand beaches. And it is true that sinking into the sands of Mirissa or Bentota, you might be tempted to do little more strenuous than ordering a Lion lager for the remainder of your stay. But if you can summon the energy to wrest yourself from its sandy southern reaches, there is more to see than sea on this stellar island, whose architectural heritage is as rich and varied as its boutique hotels  fine dining menus. The obvious first step on a Sri Lanka architectural itinerary is the 17th-century walled Galle Fort, one of seven Unesco World Heritage sites on the island, and set just steps away from those glorious beaches on the south coast. Originally founded in the 16th Century by the Portuguese, work commenced in earnest on the fort in 1663 under Dutch colonial rule, when it became the country's primary port. Its maritime significance seeped away once Sri Lanka was ceded to the British in 1796, but the fort today, comprising 36 seafront hectares, remains part of a living, working city. Admire its architecture simply by wandering the streets, before taking a trip out to examine the 19th-century frescoes at the nearby Kataluwa Purvarama Mahavihara Buddhist temple, nestled in dense forest and originally built in the 13th Century. For stunning views out over both fort and sea, return to complete a full round of the Galle Fort walls at dusk, then replenish with tasty fusion cuisine at the Galle Fort Hotel, once a gem of a merchant's mansion. Travelling upcountry to Kandy, the green hill country heart of Sri Lanka, the architectural legacy moves from colonial to religious, with Buddhist structures in abundance. Step in line with numerous pilgrims in Kandy's Unesco-rated Sacred City to visit the Dalada Maligawa, also known as the Temple of the Tooth and home to the country's most important Buddhist relic - allegedly a tooth of the Buddha. Then, to peruse the city's colonial past (it fell to the British in 1815) ramble the lanes of the British Garrison Cemetery, whose deaths, detailed on carved Victorian headstones and including sun stroke, jungle fever and rampaging elephants, paint a fascinating picture of colonial perils. Slightly farther afield, Sri Lanka's so-called \"cultural triangle\" - comprising the area bounded by Kandy, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa - hosts Sri Lanka's most celebrated archaeological and cultural sites, and four more of its Unesco World Heritage sites. Ponder civilisations long-past at Polonnaruwa, home to the ruins of a 12th-century ruler's elaborate garden city; gape at the remains of the 5th-century city of Sigiriya, built into and atop a massive granite peak. Explore the palaces and monasteries of the Sacred City of Polonnaruwa, and wander the mural-filled cave monastery of Dambulla. And even back on the south coast, hidden behind the heat and horn-honking of Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, you will also find a trove of architectural treasures, many legacies of the country's melting-pot religious heritage. Savour the century old, candy-striped Jami-Ul-Alfa Mosque, explore the 19th-century Kelaniya Raja Mahar Vihara Buddhist temple, visit the Sri Kailawasanathar Swami Devasthanam Hindu temple - the oldest in town - then look in on the shrine of St. Anthony's Church, where devotees stand in line to deposit offerings to its Technicolor shrines. Meanwhile, for something more modern, detour to the Lionel Wendt Centre to examine the contemporary art on display, then, come nightfall, see the light-dressed silhouettes of the Seema Malakaya on Beira Lake, two island pavilions designed in 1985, one filled with bronze Thai Buddhas and the other centred around a sacred bodhi tree.",

For the last 1,200 years, the Unesco World Heritage city of Santiago de Compostela has best been known as a pilgrimage destination for devout Catholics. Last year alone, nearly 500,000 faithful hikers set out along the series of well-trodden trails called \"the Camino\", journeying through the lush wooded hills and river-flecked valleys of Galicia in north-west Spain to reach the city's towering Romanesque cathedral. For years, I'd heard about Santiago's beauty from friends and fellow travellers who had gazed upon its towering church spires and twisting honey-coloured lanes. Yet, one of the great ironies is that many of those who had walked for weeks or even months to get there admitted that once they arrived, they shuffled alongside the masses into the cathedral to see the tomb of St James, slumped into one of the many touristy tapas bars around Rua Franco and then quickly headed home. If they had just taken a few more steps, I'd always wondered, would they have discovered more? I wanted to dig deeper into the city's medieval and more modern heart, but I didn't have the time or energy to trek the demanding trail myself.

Two armies have glared at each other across the DMZ for more than 50 years, ever since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Established on the ceasefire line at the end of the Korean War in 1953, this is where negotiations between North and South took place. Only an armistice was signed at the end of the war, not a full peace treaty. The 4km-wide DMZ scars the land from coast to coast and divides the Korean Peninsula into two antagonistic countries. It is probably the most heavily fortified border in the world - high fences topped with barbed wire, watchtowers, an antitank wall and obstacles. Thousands of landmines line both sides of the DMZ. Seeing the military build-up on both sides, a visit here is a sobering experience. Access to Panmunjeom, the \"truce\" village that straddles the border between North Korea and South Korea, is only for tour groups and you must carry your passport and follow a strict dress code - no offensive T-shirts, ripped shorts, flip-flops or miniskirts. The tour includes visiting one of the small, blue UN buildings that straddle the border and look like temporary classrooms. Inside are simple tables and chairs. Walk to the far end and step into North Korean territory - a strange feeling. North Korean soldiers used to peer in the windows, but recently they have kept watch from a distance. On the South Korean side soldiers in sunglasses strike taekwondo poses - partly to intimidate the North Koreans and partly to provide a photo opportunity for the tourists.

You can take in an art tour or concert in spruced-up Mexico City, attend the huge Bicentennial Expo in Guanajuato, or (and this is perhaps the most exciting of all for us history nerds) you can plan a journey along routes that follow in the lives and military campaigns of Mexico's founding heroes and revolutionaries. The official government bicentennial website provides the tools: interactive and downloadable maps and historical information. One of these routes, called La Ruta del la Libertad (\"The Liberty Route\") follows the movements and campaigns of the founder of Mexico's Independence, the balding, unorthodox priest and rebel visionary Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. This itinerary will not only take you along the same journeys as Mexico's most revered hero and his co-rebels, but through its most beloved and historically important heartland towns. Here are some highlights: Quer taro Today, Quer taro's (Central Mexico) large, historic heart is characterized by charming pedestrian streets, stunning plazas and interesting churches. The sophisticated restaurants serve up quality cuisine and the museums reflect Quer taro's important role in Mexican history. In 1810, the city became a centre of intrigue for Miguel Hidalgo and his conspirators, who met secretly at the house of Do a Josefa Ortiz, the wife of Quer taro's former district administrator. When the conspiracy was uncovered, the story goes, Do a Josefa was locked in her house (now the Palacio de Gobierno) but managed to whisper through a keyhole to a co-conspirator that their colleagues were in jeopardy, leading to Father Hidalgo's call to arms.",

        "title": "Abu Simbel: The great temple of Egypt",
        "content": "The Great Temple of Ramses II was rediscovered two hundred years ago, carved out of a mountain on the Niles  banks. The structure is a shrine to the pharaoh and primeval Egyptian gods. In his day, Ramses II built entire cities, but nothing would have been as awe-inspiring as the Great Temple which was stumbled across in the depths of the Egyptian desert near the border of Nubia, buried under centuries of sand. No temple has such ancient, in-built heart and soul, and none have matched its passionate, modern-day story of discovery and rescue. The Great Temple was first carved out of the mountain on the west bank of the Nile between 1274 and 1244BC, Ramses II's imposing temple was as much dedicated to the deified pharaoh himself as to the primeval Egyptian gods Ra-Horakhty, Amun and Ptah. Over the centuries both the Nile and the desert sands imperceptibly shifted, and this temple was lost to the world until 1813, when it was accidentally rediscovered by the Swiss explorer Jean-Louis Burckhardt. The four colossal statues of the pharaoh fronting the temple were like gigantic sentinels watching over the incoming traffic from the south, undoubtedly designed as a warning to the strength of the pharaoh. When the temple was discovered, nearly 200 years ago, only one of the heads was completely showing above the sand, the next head was broken off and, of the remaining two, only the crowns could be seen. Enough sand was cleared away in 1817 by Giovanni Belzoni for the temple to be entered. However, by the end of the century, plans were afoot to dam the Nile and it looked as though the Great Temple was doomed to be buried again, although on this occasion its coverage was intended to be water. As the plans for the High Dam were drawn up, worldwide attention focused on the many valuable and irreplaceable ancient monuments that would be destroyed by the waters of Lake Nasser. Between 1960 and 1980 the Unesco- Nubian Rescue Campaign gathered expertise and financing from more than 50 countries, and sent Egyptian and foreign archaeological teams to Nubia. Necropolises were excavated, all portable artefacts and relics were removed to museums and, while some temples disappeared beneath the lake, 14 were salvaged. Ten of them, including the temple complexes of Philae, Kalabsha and Abu Simbel, were dismantled stone by stone and painstakingly rebuilt on higher ground. Four others were donated to the countries that contributed to the rescue effort, including the splendid Temple of Dendur, now reconstructed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Perhaps the greatest achievement of all was the preservation of the temples at Abu Simbel. Ancient magnificence and skill met with equally impressive modern technology as, at a cost of about $40 million, Egyptian, Italian, Swedish, German and French archaeological teams cut the temples up into more than 2,000 huge blocks, weighing from 10 to 40 tonnes each, and reconstructed them inside an artificially built mountain, 210m away from the water and 65m higher than the original site. The temples were carefully oriented to face the original direction, and the landscape of their original environment was re-created on and around the concrete, dome-shaped mountain. The project took just over four years. The temples of Abu Simbel were officially reopened in 1968 while the sacred site they had occupied for more than 3,000 years disappeared beneath Lake Nasser. A plaque to the right of the temple entrance eloquently describes this achievement: \"Through this restoration of the past, we have indeed helped to build the future of mankind.\" In October every year, the first rays of the rising sun reach across the Nile, penetrate the temple and move along the hypostyle hall, through the vestibule and into the sanctuary, where they illuminate the somewhat mutilated figures of Ra-Horakhty, Ramses II and Amun. Ptah is never illuminated. Before the temple was moved, this would occur one day earlier. The article 'Abu Simbel: The great temple of Egypt' was published in partnership with Lonely Planet.",

The Dubai Museum is a must-see attraction in Dubai, not only for the ancient building in which it is housed, but also for its engaging exhibits. The museum's collection vividly charts Dubai's rapid progress from a tiny pre-oil fishing and pearling village - and one of the world's first free-trade ports - through to the Arabian metropolis it is today. A couple of hours spent here before exploring the rest of Dubai really help give a sense of the city's speed of evolution. Housed in the majestic Al-Fahidi Fort, built to defend Dubai Creek around 1787, it is the oldest building in the area. The structure is made from sea rocks and gypsum, and served as both residence to Dubai's rulers and the seat of government until 1971, when it became a museum. Its manageable size and entertaining exhibits give you a quick and comprehensive introduction to Dubai's history, culture and traditions. Apart from the kitsch dioramas and disturbingly lifelike mannequins, highlights include finds from the Al-Qusais archaeological site dating back to between 2500 BC and 500 BC. Visitors enjoy posing with the disconcertingly lifelike mannequins in the museum's whimsical dioramas. Leading the Bedouin's beloved beast of burden seems to be the most popular photo opportunity, but try to resist playing Indiana Jones with the safari-suited archaeologists. The long-suffering guards have given up trying to stop people posing for photos with the kitsch mannequins - so fire away. In the fort's courtyard are several small wooden boats and traditional barasti (palm-leaf) houses, including the primitive Al Kaimah, and the summerhouse Al Areesh with traditional wind-tower (barajeel) \"air conditioning\". Step inside and test it out - you'll really notice the difference if visiting on a balmy day. Within the fort's walls are fascinating weapon displays featuring beautiful old silver khanjars (curved daggers) with camel-bone decoration, and swords inscribed with calligraphy. You will also find exhibits on traditional Emirati dances and musical instruments. Don't miss the shekhlelah, a skirt hung with goat's hooves that makes music when you shake your hips. The real treats are found in the underground museum exhibits beneath the fort, featuring a multimedia presentation on Dubai's extraordinary development through the series of dioramas brought to life by excellent use of audio and hologram-like video projections. The vivid scenes represent life in the souq, Islam, education, social life, architecture, costumes and jewellery, the desert and oasis, water and survival, and the popular \"underwater\" sea exhibition.

        "title": "Helmut Schmidt: Germany s Anglophile Chancellor",
        "content": "On 5 July 1957 the Bundestag voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Treaties of Rome, which are still at the heart of today s European Union. Not all Germany s parliamentarians played along. The young Helmut Schmidt   a brash, chain-smoking Social Democrat from Hamburg   refused to support the Treaties, largely because of British non-participation.  Much as I was convinced of the necessity of European integration , he later reflected,  I then thought   that the EEC could never be successful in the absence of British experience and pragmatism.  At the time, Schmidt   who later became West German chancellor from 1974 to 1982   reflected the views of many continental politicians who looked for British help and leadership in the rebuilding of Europe. Born in 1918 and growing up in the port city of Hamburg, Schmidt had been exposed to British life and culture from an early age: his first trip abroad had been a three-week school exchange to Manchester in July 1932. In the immediate postwar years, Schmidt s political socialisation was decisively furthered by the British regional commissioner in Hamburg, Sir Vaughan Berry, who frequently initiated informal Anglo-German tea parties with politically interested young locals. Such contacts were part of the reason why Schmidt soon acquired a reputation as an unabashed  Atlanticist , who prioritised the Federal Republic s links to the Anglo-American world over Franco-German relations. On the eve of Schmidt s election in May 1974, the British Foreign Office predicted golden times for the British-German relationship, hoping that Schmidt s Germany might align itself more closely with Britain rather than France. Such hopes were misguided. During his eight years in office, Schmidt developed an exceptionally close partnership with the French President Val ry Giscard d Estaing, which resulted in major European initiatives, such as the creation of the European Council and the European Monetary System. Britain, by contrast, often seemed aloof from and dejected by this revitalised Franco-German axis, as Schmidt clashed heavily and repeatedly with his British counterparts, such as Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher, over key issues of EC politics. In later years, he appeared scornful about Britain s supposedly destructive role in the European politics of the 1970s, explaining Wilson s and Thatcher s sceptical attitude towards the EC through a more general British Euroscepticism, allegedly ingrained in British history and culture.  The Queen, the Commonwealth and the special relationship with the US is much more important than Europe , he asserted in one of his last interviews in December 2013, exclaiming that de Gaulle had been  right  in vetoing British membership during the 1960s. What changed? Yet, the real story of the British-German relationship during Schmidt s years in office is more complicated than his clich -laden recollections suggest. At the heart of Schmidt s frequent clashes with his British counterparts was not a seemingly eternal British aversion to all things European, as Schmidt would have it. The history of British-German relations under Schmidt is not one of unilateral obstructionism, but one of mutual misperceptions and misunderstandings, which can be explained by the two countries  different paths towards the European integration process after 1945. Gold Conference of Finance Ministers of the EEC countries: the UK s Denis Healey, West Germany s Helmut Schmidt and the Nethertlands  Wim Duisenberg, by Rob Mieremet, 22 April 1974. Nationaal Archief. Public Domain. Many of the deeper reasons behind the frequent bilateral clashes over Europe in the 1970s can be found in the decades prior to Schmidt s chancellorship. His initial Anglophilia was certainly sincere. In the early 1960s, he even wrote a couple of highly polemical newspaper articles in which he criticised the French and German governments for pushing ahead with the European integration process without British involvement:  Hitler also underestimated England , one headline read. As Schmidt rose through Germany s political ranks in the 1960s, however, he started to approach the European question from a more strategic angle, which made him realise the paramount importance of France to the European project. Much like Konrad Adenauer, West Germany s first chancellor, Schmidt now argued that his country s exposed geostrategic location at the centre of Europe and its unique historical burden made it a strategic necessity to embed its postwar foreign policy firmly into a multilateral European framework, thereby making Germany s political and economic resurgence palatable to its neighbours. The relationship with France, Schmidt came to believe, was the foundation for Germany s postwar rehabilitation. By the mid-1960s, Schmidt had therefore reversed his position on British EC membership almost completely.  Given its particular interests and its resulting tight bonds to France , he wrote at the time of Britain s second EC application in 1967, German simply could not  act as a battering ram and immediately open up the door to the EC for the English by exercising pressure on Paris . But it was a position determined by Schmidt s calculating head rather than his Anglophile heart: the EC was imaginable without Britain; it was unimaginable without France. A difficult role to define The British perspective on postwar European integration was rather different. In the 1950s, British reactions to the various integration initiatives contemplated on the continent had ranged from indifference to hostility: perhaps for them, but definitely not for us. Instead, Britain s postwar strategy was based on consolidating and maintaining the country s global role: not without reason, when roughly half of its trade was still conducted with the Commonwealth. Confronted with the country s postwar decline and facing the realities of a rapidly emerging European trading bloc on the continent, however, Britain s political leaders soon changed their minds and applied twice for EEC membership: under Harold Macmillan in 1961-3 and Harold Wilson in 1967. But these applications were driven largely by negative motivations: if you can t beat them, join them. The subsequent vetoes by de Gaulle added insult to injury, leaving Britain without a progressive European policy for much of the 1960s. When Britain eventually joined the EC in January 1973, it therefore had to define its role in an institutional framework that had already consolidated itself and to accept rules and mechanisms that often seemed ill-suited to Britain s interests and preferences. By the time of Schmidt s election in May 1974, then, British and German attitudes towards the EC had evolved very differently over two decades. For 1970s Germany, EC membership had come to signify the country s postwar political and economic rehabilitation; for Britain, by contrast, it seemed to symbolise the country s postwar decline and transformation into a medium-sized European power. It did not help that Britain joined the EC on the eve of a global economic crisis, with rapidly rising food prices and double-digit inflation dominating much of Britain s first decade inside the EC. Membership was not the economic panacea various governments had portrayed it to be. Helmut Schmidt, 9 July 1982. Nationaal Archief. Public Domain. These factors pointed to future problems for the British-German relationship under Schmidt. He may have wrapped his personal attachment to the European integration process in less idealistic language than most, but he had nonetheless become firmly attached to the EC as the major strategic framework for Germany s postwar rehabilitation. That is why he reacted strongly whenever he felt the EC s cohesion or past achievements were under threat. British leaders, by contrast, lacked a comparably powerful imperative for EC membership. They approached the issue from a much more transactional and, at times, openly antagonistic angle   even if it meant prolonged crises with their European partners. Take Wilson s  renegotiation & referendum  ploy in 1974-5, for example. From Wilson s perspective, it was a clever strategy to appease the formidable anti-EC wing of his Labour Party while, in the long run, ensuring Britain s continuing membership. To Schmidt, however, Wilson s approach seemed like a cynical prioritisation of narrow party political interests at the expense of his European partners. That is why he ganged up with Giscard to ensure that the renegotiations amounted to some cosmetic changes only. Wilson s strategy paid off domestically, as the 1975 referendum result testifies. But the price was a fundamental deterioration of German trust in Britain s commitment to Europe. Margaret Thatcher s resolute attempts to reduce Britain s disproportionately high contributions to the EC budget reveals similar dynamics. For Thatcher, the budget issue was a major obstacle that had to be solved first, if Britain was to play a full and active role inside the EC, whereas Schmidt regarded her single-minded pursuit of the budget question as a fundamental challenge to the EC s principles and foundations. This is why Thatcher s attempts to get Schmidt on her side backfired so dramatically, even though Germany would also probably have gained from any major reform of the EC s financing structures. Schmidt, however, saw Germany s high budget contributions as a short-term economic price for a long-term strategic gain: the EC s political cohesion and stability. It was a logic that worked well from a German perspective; it failed to convince many British observers. Thatcher moves closer The irony is that Thatcher s first years in office saw Britain move closer to Europe than ever before. At the same time that the prime minister was demanding  her money back  in Brussels, she also worked tirelessly behind the scenes to foster joint European positions within the transatlantic alliance against the background of the so-called  second  Cold War. In the major transatlantic crises over NATO s dual-track decision, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Siberian gas pipeline project, Thatcher frequently defended European viewpoints in Washington   much to the dismay of her American counterpart Ronald Reagan. But it was the Iron Lady who usually caught the headlines in Germany and who stands tall as the supreme embodiment of British Euroscepticism, even today. The frequent fights between Schmidt and his British rivals did not therefore signify a more general British aversion to all things European, as Schmidt would suggest so frequently in later years. Indeed, Britain had played a vital and proactive role in the reconstruction of Europe ever since the late 1940s, as its role in the establishment of the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) and NATO testifies. The reason why intra-EC tensions have nonetheless come to dominate perceptions of the British-German relationship after 1945 can again be found in the particular historical context of postwar Europe. For most Germans of Schmidt s generation, the European project exerted a strong emotional pull that stretched far beyond the concrete advantages of a customs union: it offered a unique opportunity to rehabilitate and reinvent postwar Germany within a European framework and to distance itself from the horrors of the recent past. Wilson and Thatcher, by contrast, may have concluded rationally that EC membership was in Britain s national interest, but they lacked any comparative emotive and personal attachment to the European project. The EC therefore remained only one of many possible arenas for European cooperation in 1970s Britain   and not one that suited the country particularly well. For most Germans, however, the EC had by that time become the only framework for European cooperation. Any criticisms of its institutions and policies were almost inevitably interpreted as more general attacks on the very principles of European cooperation and solidarity. This is the big European misunderstanding that lies at the heart of British-German relations under Schmidt. Today s European Union bears rather little resemblance to the EC of the 1970s. Nonetheless, some of the key dynamics tearing Britain and Germany apart in the 1970s can still be witnessed in contemporary debates over  Brexit : Britain is still ill at ease with many of the EU s most basic institutional characteristics and principles, whereas Germany seems anxious to preserve the EU s substance and cohesion, even at significant cost. It is thus tempting to read Schmidt s journey as merely one episode of a much longer history where the European integration process has acquired an importance for Germany which   for various reasons   has never been replicated in Britain. Yet Schmidt s story also shows that these different British and German perspectives were the result of the specific historical context of the immediate postwar decades and that they centred primarily on the concrete mechanisms and dynamics of the European Community in the 1970s. They should not be treated as evidence of an allegedly eternal British Euroscepticism, deeply rooted in British culture and history, contrary to Schmidt s musings in later years.

        "content": "What hath God wrought?  Perhaps it is a coincidence, but in the spring of 1848   four years after Samuel Morse tapped out those first words in code and sent them out into the silence   the dead started tapping out messages to the living too. It happened in upstate New York where the Fox family had recently moved. Their farmhouse was said to be haunted; a spirit was heard knocking in the night. The two youngest daughters, Catherine and Margaretta, both adolescents, discovered that if they asked questions the spirit would knock in reply. It revealed itself to belong to a 31-year-old man. Neighbours came to listen. Someone had the idea of reciting the alphabet to help the spirit speak.  One Tuesday night, at twelve o clock , the girls  mother recalled him revealing, he  was murdered by having its throat cut with a butcher knife . Spiritualism, and with it the ritual of the s ance, was born. It was a  spiritual telegraph , a friend said. The fame of the Fox sisters spread. People came to speak to the spirits of children they had lost, others came for advice on love or on stocks and shares. It seems to have been the girls  older sister Leah Fish   35 and married   who saw the commercial possibilities. On 14 November 1848 the first public demonstration of the sisters  powers took place at the Corinthian Hall in Rochester.  We ... could not but admit the evidence of [our] senses , the local paper reported.  THE GHOST was there.  Spiritualism exploded. By the late 1860s there were some 11 million spiritualists in the US alone. Fame took its toll on the Fox sisters, however. In 1888 Margaretta, widowed and alcoholic, gave an interview to the New York Herald.  Is it all a trick?  the journalist asked.  Absolutely , Margaretta replied.  Spirits, is he not easily fooled?  As a child, she explained, she learned to make the sounds using the joints in her feet. A sense of sadness pervades the interview.  The spirits will not come back , she said of the dead.

        "title": "The Heretic of Cacheu  and  Worlds of Unfreedom  review",
        "content": "The Portuguese pioneered trans-Atlantic slavery, trafficking more people than any other nation and continuing to do so decades after Britain s abolition of the trade in 1807. Yet the country s first, long-promised, memorial to victims of slavery   Angolan artist Kiluanji Kia Henda s  Plantation   Prosperity and Nightmare    only materialised in Lisbon in 2021. As is the case in other countries with a shameful history of involvement with the slave trade, discussions of that history can be contentious.  Those who question the narrative are called  woke  and face arguments such as  it was the British Empire that was racist, not ours , explained historian Pedro Cardim in 2023. The question  what about Portugal?  has likewise been posed by those seeking to decentre Britain s own history of participation in the slave trade. These two books from historians immersed in the lusophone colonial world bookend the beginning and end of Portuguese involvements in the Atlantic slave trade. In The Heretic of Cacheu Toby Green explores the minutiae of everyday interactions among Portuguese slave traders, mixed-heritage middle-women, and African chiefdoms in a town where trans-Atlantic slave-trading was taking off in the early 17th century. In Worlds of Unfreedom, Roquinaldo Ferreira develops a similarly fine-grained account of Portuguese traffickers  relationships with Africans at a time when abolitionism was threatening the economic dominance of all those complicit in that trade. Green s story is centred on the arrest and Inquisitorial trial for heresy of Crispina Peres, a woman of Portuguese and Bainuk descent, who was married to the former captain-general of Cacheu in today s Guinea-Bissau, in the mid-1600s. Like most of the town s elite, Peres both owned domestic slaves and traded captives to the Portuguese  market . The latter were obtained primarily by armed groups known as gampisas in the interior, and by Bijag  islanders who lived on the offshore archipelago and raided mainland communities. Local and more distant African polities   the Bainuk, Pepel, Flouk, Mandinga, Jolof, and Ser er   variously avoided, resisted, or profited from the Atlantic trade networks. One of Green s key insights is how tenuous the boundary was between the different forms of slavery in Cacheu. Societies in West Africa had long practised a domestic form of enslavement for war captives and those born into slavery. These captives survived within the owner s household in relationships of dependency, subject always to their caprice. But the slavery introduced by the Portuguese was different. It entailed the reduction of captives to the status of commodity for export. Green writes that Peres had  a clear understanding of the hatred that underlay her daily interactions  with the enslaved in her household, but exploited their  terrible fear of being sold into Atlantic trafficking . Household slavery in Cacheu was at least preferable to the Middle Passage. The town s social hierarchy rested on free people s attempts to mark their free status and enslaved peoples  efforts to demonstrate their value to local owners and avoid being sold to the traffickers. Green describes life in Cacheu in far more detail than historians of local colonial societies usually manage thanks largely to the Inquisition records of witnesses  interrogation for Peres  trial in Lisbon in 1665. They included some of Peres  own household slaves. One of them, Sabasti o Rodrigues Barraza, claimed that he had denounced Peres because he had been promised his freedom by her accusers. These included two of Peres  major commercial rivals and the main instigator, the disgraced priest Luis Rodrigues, who had himself been arrested by the Inquisition for soliciting women in the confession booth. Together these men conspired to denounce Peres for the  use of African healing and knowledge  which, they knew, would be interpreted in Lisbon as an assault on empire. Her real crime, Green argues, was her challenge to these Portuguese men s dominance of the local slave trading economy. Having spent three years in the Inquisitorial jail, Peres died soon after her return to Cacheu in 1668. Ferreira s account takes place two centuries later and more than 2,000 miles south in Angola, the main source of captives for the by-then illicit slave trade. As the Portuguese historian Jo o Pedro Marques has suggested, the imperial authorities adopted a gradualist approach after British abolition in 1807, partly as a  cautious guarantee  to Portugal s domestic antislavery campaigners, and partly to assuage pressure from abroad. The loss of Brazil as the main source of demand for Portuguese trafficking after 1822 meant that the empire had less to lose from enforcing abolition and more to gain by taking some of the initiative back from Britain. Enforcing abolition of the Atlantic trade also enabled Portugal to retain captive labour within its African colonies. Like the British and French, the Portuguese were intent by the mid-19th century on extracting Africa s raw materials. They learned from the British how to use antislavery initiatives to pursue this new post-slavery project, invading the Kongo kingdom and taking control of the Bembe copper mines in 1856 on the pretext of suppressing slavery before the British could do so. Their  antislavery  military expedition conveniently carried mining equipment. Abolition thus became  a tool for the creation of new forms of unfreedom . As one French official explained, referring to the British practice of forcing Africans  liberated  from slave ships to work elsewhere in its empire,  England herself gives us an example , the only difference being that the  French bought their captives on land and the English seized theirs at sea and forced them to emigrate . The Portuguese justified the removal of African men and women from Angola to work on the coffee plantations of S o Tom  and Pr ncipe by invoking the British example of forcing  apprentices  from Sierra Leone to work on Caribbean sugar plantations. Both authors take great care to emphasise the agency of African people. Ferreira tells the intriguing story of Eufrazina, an enslaved African woman whom the Luanda businesswoman and slave trader Dona Ana Joaquina sent as envoy to negotiate a treaty with the powerful Lunda Kingdom. Anticipating the supply of captives for the Atlantic trade drying up, Joaquina hoped to initiate and monopolise a new trade in wax, ivory, and captives purely for the local market. British officials praised her for leading  the only attempt to give capital a more wholesome direction  by developing sugar production using locally enslaved African labour. But both books are obliged, ultimately, to recognise the limited ability of their African protagonists to challenge a highly militarised and increasingly rich and powerful Europe. At both the beginning and the end of slavery, West Africa s economies were reoriented around European demands, first for the extraction of captives, and then for the exploitation of land and labour in situ. In the meantime, between the 1650s and the 1850s, mixed-race elites had more power in the Portuguese slave-trading entrep ts than one might expect. In 1836, Benguela s Portuguese governor lamented that:  Every time that elections have taken place ... those elected have always been either blacks or mixed-race individuals [pardos], and whites have been excluded.  The resistance that Portugal encountered from these groups as it abolished its slave trade and developed as a territorial colonial power is a key part of the region s history, as Ferreira s book shows. Together these painstakingly researched studies recreate a world in which slavery was a significant but widely disavowed part of everyday life.

        "content": "In popular history, there are few more challenging subjects than the supernatural and religious beliefs of the past. Even the most open-minded modern historian or reader of history can struggle as we try to engage with unfamiliar thought-worlds, or cultures where supernatural realities were felt to permeate daily life in ways now unfamiliar to us. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of a writer who sought to interpret for her own time a form of spirituality which can be especially difficult for a modern Western audience to grasp. Evelyn Underhill, born on 6 December 1875, played an influential role in introducing readers to key works of medieval and early modern mystical and visionary experience.",

At the end of my  audience  I asked him what constituted the greatest asset for a historian. I expected something along the lines of Leopold von Ranke s famous formulation ( Good history requires three things: critical use of the material, insight into how things happen, and good fortune in describing them ). Braudel disagreed. He answered my question without hesitation:  imagination . It was Braudel s imagination that made him the 20th century s greatest Western historian.

        "title": "El General simo  by Giles Tremlett book review",
        "content": "The bloody victor of the Spanish Civil War continues to evoke controversy. When, in 2011, Spain s Royal Academy of History, under the supervision of a former Franco loyalist, published a dictionary describing Franco as  authoritarian, but not a dictator , the backlash raged for years. The past quarter-century of Spanish public life has been shaped by so-called  memory wars  in which both the intransigent left and right have politicised attempts to identify the mass graves of republican dead and unveil the convenient silence ( pact of oblivion ) which overlay the latter two-thirds of Spain s 20th century. Franco s regime has been presented as authoritarian (Juan Linz), genocidal (Helen Graham), and fascistic in inception (Paul Preston). The regime s apologists presented the personal rule of Western Europe s last dictator as developmentalist, providential, even as an  organic democracy . In this biography, Giles Tremlett describes Franco as  a giant dam, determined to control the flow of Spanish history . However, 50 years after his death in November 1975,  what surprises is not the size of the dam that was opened after he died, but the ideological emptiness that lay behind it . Mediocre, incurious, and obsequious towards his Axis patrons, Franco had none of the charisma of Mussolini or Mao, nor any of the avuncular qualities of the sister regime of Salazar in Portugal. It is faint praise to rate him less fanatically murderous than Adolf Hitler, or less tyrannically ruthless than Joseph Stalin (even though Franco possessed as much internal power as Europe s bloodiest totalitarians). Tremlett s Franco is a cautious, ambitious, and unthinkingly authoritarian man, youthfully brave in Spanish Morocco, callously attritional in middle age leading the rebels to victory in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), and vindictive and shifty in the grey areas of politics thereafter. Unrivalled at dividing and ruling allies and enemies alike, he was also prone to delusions which only his peculiar luck prevented from unravelling his regime at home and abroad. Tremlett explains Franco s formative years without imposing 21st-century psychology on the patriarchal norms and family hypocrisies of 1890s Spain. He was born to a doting mother and a wayward (later estranged) father in Ferrol, a Galician port city where the navy was everything in a Spain where it was nothing. Franco s childhood was forged by the upheavals of the turn of the century. The loss of Spain s major colonies in the war of 1898 fired up a generation of army officers determined to restore national honour in new campaigns to extend Spanish control over the northern part of Morocco. Like so many of his generation, Franco believed in ill-focused national  regeneration    and in the responsibility of the army to achieve it. As a young officer Franco excelled. Despite his social awkwardness, he married into a higher social rank in 1917. His subordinates and officer comrades respected his battlefield bravery and at 31 Franco became Europe s youngest general since Napoleon. The Second Republic (1931-36) alienated his naturally conservative and Catholic instincts. But unlike other leading army plotters (Sanjurjo, Mola, Queipo de Llano, et al.) Franco was politically malleable. He was neither too monarchical, nor too Carlist, nor too fascist, nor too republican: these factors as much as his command of elite troops in Spanish Morocco made him General simo ten weeks into the Civil War. In addition to his clever operations marching on Madrid in October 1936 and his direct diplomacy with Hitler, Franco was a soldier s soldier who divided right-wingers the least. But neither his allies nor his enemies imagined that the five-feet-four-inch Galician would remain in power for half a century. After the victory of 1939 Tremlett takes us into the well-trodden ground of postwar Spain. Believing until incredibly late in the Second World War that an Axis victory was likely, Franco was too slow in reverting from non-belligerent to neutral status. He aggravated his regime s postwar isolation by imposing self-defeating economic autarky and indulging the corruption of his subordinates. Another 50-or-so pages on the post-1939 era would have improved Tremlett s analysis. More could have been made of the ravages of the developmentalist frenzy of the 1940s and 1950s, including hydrology, irrigation, and resettlement schemes. The diplomatic context is largely Eurocentric: not much is made of Franco s unusually good relations with the Arab world, or the integrist links with Latin America. The economic impact of world trade and tourism is better handled. Once liberalisation finally improved the economy after 1959 Franco s regime took the credit, in a similar way to the post-Cold War Chinese Communist Party after the horrors of Maoism. Youth revolt, European cultural norms, and the defection of the Catholic Church all frayed the dictatorship in its final years. But the failure of internal and external opposition to unite, combined with the dreary apoliticism which the regime had drummed into the masses, meant that Franco died a natural death in November 1975   a remarkable achievement for one of Europe s nastiest dictators. Given Franco s remarkable agency throughout his reign, one is given to ponder the  what ifs  implicit in Tremlett s account. What if Franco s stomach wound in 1916 had proved fatal? What if his feet had stayed cold in the army plot of 1936? What if he had joined the Axis in 1940 and suffered Allied invasion as a consequence? Or, even more radically, what if he had dared to break with the Axis in the final weeks of the 1945 campaign in Western Europe and declared war on the Nazis, thereby accruing to his regime something of the cheap economic and geostrategic benefits that the left-authoritarian C rdenas regime of Mexico enjoyed in its symbolic war with Japan? In a biography as agentic as Tremlett s, one is given to wonder about Spanish history s many glaring counterfactuals.

        "title": "Chernobyl Children  by Melanie Arndt review",
        "content": "The explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on 26 April 1986 was an environmental catastrophe. The radioactive fallout contaminated territory that was home to seven million people, including three million children. It also reached Western Europe, causing an international scandal. And still, the Soviet authorities attempted to do what they always did when it came to major accidents: hush it up. For three years the state concealed the truth about the scale of the disaster from its citizens and the world. All this changed because of the children, as Melanie Arndt reveals in her book. Why, many asked, if the radiation levels supposedly posed no danger, were some children from contaminated areas being evacuated to other parts of the country? In the charged political atmosphere of the late 1980s, when glasnost turned from a slogan into actual policy, the authorities yielded to mounting public pressure. In February 1989 two main Belarusian newspapers were the first to print maps showing the extent of the radioactive contamination. Pravda followed suit six weeks later (an unprecedented reversal of the Soviet press hierarchy). The censorship ban on Chernobyl collapsed two months after that. The revelations made clear that the children living in contaminated areas needed urgent help. Initially, all eyes turned to the state, which had long boasted that it provided Soviet children with the happiest childhood in the world. As it turned out, the state could do precious little. With the economy in free fall, it had few resources available to offer the medical care required. Local authorities in Belarus and Ukraine increasingly felt abandoned by Moscow. The regime s failure to protect the children contributed to its spiralling loss of legitimacy. Caught between public anger and its own impotence, the Soviet government openly appealed for international help. In March 1990 Cuba received its first group of 139 children. Only recently itself the recipient of Soviet aid, Cuba covered all the expenses and Fidel Castro personally welcomed the children at the airport. Cuba would go on to host more than 20,000 children over the following two decades. Charity had been a dirty word in Soviet ideology, but the environmental crisis coupled with economic collapse forced a rethink. Numerous initiatives sprang up to fill the vacuum left by the dying regime, paving the way from socialist to civil society. Before that first group arrived in Cuba, a non-state initiative in Belarus had organised the first recuperative trip abroad, sending a group of children from the Belarusian village of Stralichava to India in December 1989. Many more trips to Europe, Canada, and the US would follow. Through her detailed account of this organisation, registered in November 1990 as the Belarusian Charitable Foundation for the Children of Chernobyl, Arndt traces how civil society helped turn  the Soviet Chernobyl children  into the  children of the whole world . The Belarusian Charitable Foundation was just one of several organisations that collectively sent more than one million Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Russian children abroad. While historians have shown how Chernobyl animated anti-Soviet opposition in Ukraine, Arndt s book reminds us how central the trauma has been in Belarus. Around 70 per cent of the radioactive contamination landed there, not least because the authorities in Moscow ordered that the  dirty  clouds be made to rain over Belarus in order to protect Russian and Ukrainian cities. As Arndt argues, civil society cannot exist outside of politics. Suspicious of state authority, the foundation believed that their project would have more than just health benefits for the children it sent abroad. It would help democratise Belarus, where authoritarianism returned after the election of Aliaksandr Lukashenka in 1994. His regime harassed the foundation precisely because it saw its activities in the same political light. In 1997 the KGB investigated it for four months on charges of financial irregularities and funding the opposition. After nearly 25 difficult years, the foundation ended its work in 2014. But politics also shaped the Western response, on which all efforts to help Belarusian children hinged. Civil societies across the Atlantic (Arndt s main focus) were galvanised into action, but their motivations were a tangled knot of personal agendas and politics. These were exciting times, as ordinary Americans suddenly gained an opportunity to pursue citizens  diplomacy with the former  evil empire . Despite the book s title, this is mostly a story about adults: state organisations failing to fulfil their obligations, civil society rising on the ruins of socialism, transnational humanitarian networks forming in the wake of the Cold War. Only in the final chapter do the children take centre stage, alongside their Belarusian chaperones and American hosts. It seems a pity that this essential part of the story is relegated to the finale. It is clear from the interviews and the study by two Belarusian social psychologists on which Arndt relies that the experience burst open the children s horizons. One participant remembers West Germany as  an explosion, a shock, nothing but positive emotions . Perhaps Lukashenka was right to worry. After all, the generation of former Chernobyl children challenged his regime in unprecedented mass protests that swept Belarus in 2020. The regime s botched handling of another health-related disaster, the Covid-19 pandemic, combined with anger over fraudulent elections to produce a perfect storm. But unlike Gorbachev in 1991, Lukashenka survived by resorting to brutal repression, which continues to this day. Another generation of Belarusian children now lives in the shadow of Chernobyl, but there are no transnational humanitarian networks left to offer them respite. State repression has wiped out Belarusian civil society and depleted the medical profession. The regime s collusion in Russia s war on Ukraine has sealed Belarus  isolation from the West.

        "title": "A look inside Egypt s newly unveiled Grand Egyptian Museum",
        "content": "After two decades and an estimated cost of $1bn, the Grand Egyptian Museum opens its doors to the public on Tuesday. After two decades and an estimated cost of $1bn, the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) opened its doors to the public on Tuesday, just a few days after the official opening ceremony on Saturday. Regarded as the world s largest archaeological facility for a single civilisation, the museum is located 2km (1.2 miles) from the pyramids of Giza and 8km (5 miles) from the capital, Cairo. The complex spans nearly 500,000sq metres (5,381,900sq ft) and will house more than 100,000 ancient artefacts from the 30 dynasties of ancient Egypt. Some of the main attractions include the 3,200-year-old, 11.36-metre (37ft) statue of King Ramses II, the complete collection of Tutankhamun s treasures and a 4,500-year-old boat, one of the oldest intact ships in the world, belonging to Khufu, the pharaoh renowned for building the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Grand Egyptian Museum s design The museum has been called the  fourth pyramid  of the Giza Plateau, which is home to three pyramids about 4,500 years old: the Great Pyramid of Giza (built for Pharaoh Khufu), the Pyramid of Khafre (built for Pharaoh Khafre) and the Pyramid of Menkaure (built for Pharaoh Menkaure). Visitors can view the pyramids from inside the museum, which is designed in the shape of a chamfered triangle, echoing the geometry of the pyramids. The museum s north and south walls are aligned with the Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure. The design, created by the Irish architecture firm Heneghan Peng, uses sand-coloured concrete and translucent alabaster stone while the museum s main facade is made of frosted glass panels. The complex was announced in 1992, but construction did not begin until 2005 and was delayed by political turmoil after the 2011 Arab Spring and the COVID-19 pandemic. Some areas of the museum had a soft launch in 2024. The museum complex includes the main building, a conference centre, a courtyard, a Nile Valley park, the Khufu Boat Museum and a conservation centre. A look inside the museum Upon entering the museum, visitors are greeted by the 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II, which weighs about 83 tonnes.  From 1954 to 2006, the statue stood in Ramses Square in front of Cairo s main train station before being relocated to its new location near the museum. To facilitate the move, the statue was transported upright and in one piece on a specially designed 128-wheel vehicle, covering a distance of 30km (19 miles) and necessitating temporary road closures. Beyond the entrance is the six-storey grand staircase, lined with about 60 artefacts, including statues that honour deities, sarcophagi that hold the deceased, columns showcasing ancient architectural artistry,, and stelae inscribed with significant texts. The museum boasts 12 main permanent exhibition halls, which opened last year and are organised by both era (ranging from prehistory through the Greco-Roman period) and theme (including society, kingship and belief). The Tutankhamun gallery Among the museum s most prominent and largest exhibition spaces is the Tutankhamun Gallery, a 7,500sq-metre (80,000sq-ft) space that features more than 5,000 artefacts unearthed from the tomb of Tutankhamun, the boy king who ascended to the throne at about nine years old and ruled during the Eighteenth Dynasty nearly 3,400 years ago. Despite his brief reign, which ended with his unexpected death at about 18 or 19 years old, Tutankhamun is one of the most famous pharaohs, largely due to the discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922 in the Valley of the Kings on the west side of the Nile opposite the city of Luxor. Visitors can see his golden mask, throne, sarcophagus, chariots and jewellery, all presented to re-create the atmosphere of his royal burial chamber. One of the world s largest museums The Grand Egyptian Museum has about 45,000sq metres (484,000sq ft) of exhibition space, making it the sixth largest museum in the world by display area. The Louvre in Paris tops the list with 72,735sq metres, followed by the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia (66,842sq metres), the National Museum of China in Beijing (65,000sq metres), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City (58,820sq metres) and the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain (47,700sq metres). Tourism is a major source of foreign currency for Egypt. In 2024, a record 15.7 million tourists visited Egypt, and the travel and tourism sector contributed roughly 8 percent of the country s gross domestic product, according to official figures.",

        "title": "Mona Lisa to the Nazis: Robbed often, why latest Louvre theft is different",
        "content": "Experts say jewels stolen in heists from the iconic Parisian museum are harder to recover than stolen paintings, as they can be quickly broken down. The band of robbers who broke into the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning and stole eight Napoleonic pieces of priceless jewellery in a four-minute heist were just the latest in a long line of daring thieves who have targeted the iconic museum. The robbers used a truck-mounted ladder to reach the gilded Galerie d Apollon (Apollo s Gallery) on the second floor before taking an angle grinder to a window to access the French crown jewels. The heist took place at 9:30am (07:30 GMT), half an hour after the museum opened to visitors for the day. The robbers are still at large and the Louvre is currently closed. A ninth item they stole   the crown belonging to Empress Eugenie, Napoleon III s wife   was recovered nearby after it was dropped by the group, the French Ministry of the Interior said. The Louvre was a royal palace for more than two centuries. It opened as a public museum in 1793 during the French Revolution. The revolution had made totems of monarchical history especially vulnerable to looters, and the Louvre, besides giving everyday French people a glimpse of these precious items, sought to protect the legacy they represented, for future generations. That did not completely stop thieves, however. Over time, there have been several attempts to steal valuable items from the Louvre   often successful. 1911: The Mona Lisa is stolen On August 21, 1911, Leonardo da Vinci s Mona Lisa was stolen in what was deemed the  heist of the century . At the time, the Mona Lisa was one of Italian painter da Vinci s lesser-known works and had been on display since 1797. Many now say it was the theft itself that propelled the painting to its modern fame. At the time, the painting was hanging on a wall in a room called the  Salon Carre .  The heist was carried out by Vincenzo Peruggia, a 29-year-old Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre. He entered the museum completely unchallenged on the evening of August 20, clad in his old museum uniform. Peruggia hid in a storage closet overnight and, in the morning, when the museum was closed and almost empty, emerged from the closet. He simply removed the painting from the wall and wrapped it in a white sheet. As he made to leave the museum, he found the stairwell door to the courtyard locked. But instead of being suspicious, a Louvre plumber helped Peruggia to unlock the door, mistaking him for a colleague. Museum security was rather less robust back then, and paintings would often be removed for maintenance or to be photographed. Hence, no one batted an eye at the absence of the da Vinci painting for more than a day. Concern over its absence was eventually raised by a visiting artist, who came to the Salon Carre to paint. When the Louvre guards could not find the painting, police were alerted. What followed was an extensive manhunt and media frenzy. The police did not initially find many leads. Avant garde poet Guillaume Apollinaire was arrested and questioned due to his links to earlier thefts from the Louvre. Apollinaire, who was cleared of suspicion, pointed to his friend, a young Pablo Picasso, who was also questioned by the police. Picasso was cleared of suspicion in the theft of the Mona Lisa, but in a grand twist, it was revealed he had previously acquired Iberian statue heads which had been stolen from the Louvre. He returned these to the Louvre to avoid any further trouble. Rumours and speculation mounted about the painting s possible whereabouts, with many believing it was smuggled abroad. But, the whole time, the Mona Lisa was actually in Peruggia s one-bedroom apartment in Paris. It was finally recovered in 1913 when Peruggia attempted to sell it to a gallery in Italy. He believed the sale had been successful when an art dealer he was in touch with invited him to Italy for a potential sale to a gallery, and he took the painting with him. Instead of buying the painting, however, the gallery turned Peruggia in. He was arrested in his hotel room in Florence. The Mona Lisa was returned to the Louvre in 1914, and Peruggia was charged with the theft. He said he had been motivated by national pride to steal the painting, claiming the painting had been looted from Italy. The painting was actually completed in France by Da Vinci and sold to the French royal family. 1940s: The Nazis attempt to loot the Louvre In 1940, the Nazis invaded France amid World War II and appeared poised to loot a section of the Louvre.  However, as a preemptive move, Jacques Jaujard, the director of France s national museums, ordered more than 1,800 cases containing Louvre masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa, to be moved to the French countryside. This prevented a large-scale cultural loss when the Nazis marched into a largely empty museum. However, the Nazis did steal many pieces of Jewish artwork while occupying France. Many of these have been returned to France, and the Louvre began displaying them in 2018 in an attempt to reunite the stolen pieces with their original owners. 1960s to 1990s: More robberies In 1966, five pieces of antique, handmade jewellery were stolen from John F Kennedy International Airport in New York. The jewellery was en route back to Paris from the United States, having been loaned by the Louvre for a museum display in Richmond, Virginia. Detectives later recovered the jewellery in a grocery bag, and three men were arrested for receiving stolen property. In 1990, Pierre Auguste Renoir s Portrait of a Seated Woman was cut from its frame and stolen from the third floor of the Louvre. At the same time, the museum discovered that some small jewellery items were also missing   and may have been for some time.  The disappearance of these objects, which are not of great value and are often seen on the market, is certainly quite old,  the then-director of museums in France said, according to The New York Times. It is unclear whether these items were ever recovered. What s different this time? This week s jewellery heist is distinctive because previous high-profile robberies in the Louvre have largely been of paintings.  A jewellery theft is a very different thing to consider because of the high intrinsic value of the object stolen,  American art historian Noah Charney told Al Jazeera. Paintings have a non-intrinsic value, which is value assigned to them due to their cultural significance, he explained.  A painting doesn t have a high intrinsic value because it s usually made of panel and pigment, and canvas and nothing more. Whereas jewellery has a high intrinsic value because if you break down what was stolen and sell the components, the value is still significant.  With jewels, the cultural heritage value, which provides the majority of its value, is not something that the thieves are likely to take into consideration,  Charney added. Does this make stolen jewels harder to trace? Yes. Collections of jewels can be broken down, recut and sold in a way that does not link them to the intact stolen items, making them almost impossible to trace   yet very valuable. They do not even need to be on the black market if the jewels are recut significantly enough that they are not identifiable.  The only hope that police have, and we understand this from how past cases have played out, is if they offer a reward for the recovery of all the jewels intact that is higher than the value of the component parts of the jewellery,  Charney said. Such a move might buy the police a bit more time to track down the items and catch those responsible as the thieves ponder their next move.   Otherwise, I m afraid there s not much hope that these will be recovered and they would likely have been cut down within hours of the theft,  he said.",

        "content": "Beneath William & Mary s Robert M. Gates Hall, archaeologists this summer uncovered a remarkable find: the near-complete 18th-century foundation of the Williamsburg Bray School. The Bray School, one of the oldest known institutions in North America dedicated to the education of enslaved and free Black children, operated on the site from 1760 to 1765. Its foundations were thought to be only partially intact. Researchers also discovered a previously undocumented cellar, layered with centuries of artifacts. The discoveries provide a new portal into the site s past, providing a more complete story of the Williamsburg Bray School, its scholars and their impact. Archaeologists from the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research work at the dig site beneath Gates Hall. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research)  As the United States prepares to mark its 250th anniversary, William & Mary is embracing its role as a steward of the nation s origin stories   and as a catalyst for their expansion,  said W&M President Katherine A. Rowe.  The discovery of this cellar is thrilling,  Rowe added.  The roots of our city and university entwine here. Every layer of history that it reveals gives us new insights into our early republic, from the Williamsburg Bray School through the generations that followed, up through the early 20th century.  Layered with history The foundation and cellar discoveries were first made early this spring by Colonial Williamsburg Foundation (CWF) archaeologists conducting preliminary investigations for the Gates Hall renovation project. The W&M Real Estate Foundation is managing the renovation and expansion on behalf of the W&M Foundation. Since the spring, the W&M Center for Archaeological Research (the Center), under the leadership of Elizabeth J. Monroe and David Lewes, has expanded the excavation and led artifact recovery. The cellar is sizeable: approximately 36 by 18 feet. Two distinct levels are emerging. The Center team has exposed the bottom of the cellar almost eighteen inches higher than the previous depth found by the CWF team.  It looks like the cellar was a partial cellar, and had different floor levels potentially,  said Center Project Archaeologist Tom Higgins.  It s not a brick-lined cellar   it was probably dug soon after the foundations were laid.  In addition to the foundation and cellar, their work is revealing a rich archaeological story that stretches from the 18th century to the mid-20th century: jewelry, slate pencil fragments, sherds of pottery and vases, buttons   the stuff of everyday life, the ephemera of history. 19th and 20th century artifacts recovered from the cellar layers found beneath Gates Hall. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research) Each excavated layer reveals more discoveries. Among the recovered items are fragments of colonoware pottery   handmade ceramics often associated with sites of enslavement and Indigenous communities   as well as sherds of Greek Revival ceramics, glass, and decorative items linked to the women who lived in Brown Hall during the early 1900s. Before it was moved down Prince George Street in 1930, the original Williamsburg Bray School building housed Methodist women attending William & Mary from 1924-1930. These students were among the first generations of women to attend college in the U.S. The significance of these discoveries is amplified by the site s connection to the Williamsburg Bray School. Archaeologists found this sherd of glass containing a depiction of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, war and the arts. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research) A favorite recovery of the team is a sherd of glass depicting Minerva, Roman goddess of wisdom, justice, war and the arts. The Minerva sherd juxtaposes with a piece of late 19th century or early 20th century flatware, painted with a Greek meandros pattern.  We know that the girls at Brown Hall were furnishing their dorms,  Michele L. Brumfield, senior researcher at the Center, said.  So maybe they were bringing in things like this.  The team is careful not to draw too many conclusions from what they are finding   yet.  It s early days,  Monroe added. Once bagged and labeled, artifacts will travel to the lab at the Center for further study. Spaces of engagement Plans are underway to incorporate the archaeological discoveries, as well as photographs and other documents, into a permanent exhibit inside Gates Hall. The exhibit will be co-curated with members of the Williamsburg Bray School Descendant Community and other stakeholders. Their stories   once lost to the recesses of the cellar   will enlighten students and visitors. Other artifacts will be lent to The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, where they will join additional items connected to the site for display at the Colin G. and Nancy N. Campbell Archaeology Center, scheduled to open in 2026. One of the recovered artifacts appears to be a pin with tiny inlaid shells dating to the early 20th-century. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research) At Gates Hall, the intention is to outline the foundation of the original Bray School on the floor and, if possible, excavate a portion for display in the exhibit   reminders of the lives lived on the site. The renovation at Gates Hall, made possible by a $30 million gift from an anonymous alumna, represents William & Mary s commitment to addressing 21st-century challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration.

        "content": "The Trojan War was celebrated by legendary authors like Homer, who told the tale of the large wooden horse that tricked the soldiers of Troy. In the stories, Paris, the son of a Trojan King, ran away with a Spartan's wife named Helen; the Spartan's brother then \"led a Greek expedition against Troy,\" according to Britannica. War raged for a decade before the Greeks pretended to withdraw, hiding soldiers in the horse.     But was the Trojan War real? It's described by Britannica as a \"legendary conflict between the early Greeks and the people of Troy in western Anatolia,\" probably in the 12th or 13th century. That's present-day Turkey. According to BBC, it's generally believed that the Trojan War was a real event, despite its appearance in various works of literature. Now a new excavation is shedding more light on that. The dig has already unearthed 3,500-year-old \"sling stones\" that match the right time frame, and that's not all.

        "title": "Ancient Artifacts Unearthed in Iraq Shed Light on Hidden History of Mesopotamia",
        "content": "New discoveries by a UCF researcher and her team at the ancient Mesopotamian site of Kurd Qaburstan, including clay tablets with ancient cuneiform writing, a game board and large structural remains, may provide a wealth of knowledge about this Middle Bronze Age city and shed light on the more hidden history of Mesopotamia. The clay tablets are the first of their kind found in the region and are still being interpreted. Early findings indicate they provide a greater insight about the people who lived there and the significantly consequential events they encountered. One of three clay cuneiform tablets discovered at the Middle Bronze Age site of Kurd Qaburstan in northeast Iraq. It was found in a debris-filled corridor in the lower town palace. Early interpretations of this tablet suggests dramatic events and possibly ancient warfare. (Photo courtesy of Tiffany Earley-Spadoni) Tiffany Earley-Spadoni, an associate professor of history at UCF, and a team of researchers have been carefully uncovering culturally significant Middle Bronze Age (1800 BCE) discoveries at Mesopotamian site of Kurd Qaburstan, which is situated in the Erbil region in northeast Iraq. A significant portion of human development and history may be traced back to the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia, in and around present-day Iraq. The study of these new tablets could reveal important details about the city s connections with its neighbors during the Middle Bronze Age and its historical significance. For example, by studying people s names, word choice and writing styles, scholars may better understand literacy in the region and the city s cultural identity, Earley-Spadoni says in her fieldwork summary. Hidden History The Middle Bronze Age in northern Iraq is poorly understood due to limited prior research and the inherent biases of the available historical sources, she says.  We hope to find even more historical records that will help us tell the story of [the city] from the perspective of its own people rather than relying only on accounts written by their enemies,  Earley-Spadoni says.  While we know a great deal about the development of writing in southern Iraq, far less is known about literacy in northern Mesopotamian cities, especially near Erbil where Kurd Qaburstan is located.  Mesopotamia, with its dense network of ancient cities in the fertile plains along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers near the Persian Gulf, is often regarded as the birthplace of urban civilization. These cities, preserved as towering tells, mounds formed by centuries of accumulated cultural debris, have captivated scholars for generations.  We know quite a bit about Mesopotamian cities in the south, and that s considered the traditional heartland of cities,  Earley-Spadoni says.  When people think about where cities first arose, they imagine cities in southern Iraq, like Uruk. We seek to fill in this gap in the scholarship by investigating a large urban site, one of the few that s ever been investigated in northern Iraq.  New Areas Uncovered, New Questions Raised Earley-Spadoni and researchers have been working in two primary areas: the northwest residential neighborhoods and a newly discovered administrative complex identified as a lower town palace, which was theorized to exist based on findings made in 2022. Researchers used technologies such as magnetometry, which allows researchers to peer through the ground to see architectural plans, to help excavate the site. The research is valuable its own right and helps shed light on regional history and worldwide heritage, she says.  The focus of the research is the organization of ancient cities, and it s specifically the organization of Kurd Qaburstan,  Earley-Spadoni says.  You may have heard of King Hammurabi, who erected the famous law code. So, this is about that same time almost 4,000 years ago. We decided that this would be an interesting place to investigate what it was like to be an everyday person at a city during the Middle Bronze Age, which has been an understudied topic. People like to excavate palaces and temples, and very few residential areas have been excavated.  Excavations in the palace revealed monumental architecture, human remains and evidence of destruction, suggesting a significant historical event. The complex, identified through geophysical surveys, is being excavated to establish its characteristics and better understand its function.

(Photo courtesy of Tiffany Earley-Spadoni) In the northwest neighborhoods, exterior courtyards, clay drainpipes, and household refuse were uncovered. Excavated pottery included everyday items such as cups, plates, bowls and storage jars. Some of the pottery was surprisingly well-decorated and carefully made, hinting that private wealth may have been more common than expected, Earley-Spadoni says in her fieldwork summary report. Animal bones found with the pottery suggest that residents enjoyed a varied diet, including domesticated meat and wild game. This level of variety of diet is unexpected for non-elite populations in Mesopotamian cities, based on limited current evidence. These findings may challenge ideas about sharp divisions between elite and non-elite lifestyles in ancient cities. The material culture and dietary practices reflect a community where some people lived relatively well and suggests that further research and analysis is needed to answer lingering questions, Earley-Spadoni says.  We re studying this ancient city to learn very specific things about the ancient inhabitants,  she says.  First, to what degree did they plan their environment, or was it just the result of an organic process? We also want to know how social inequality worked in this ancient city. Were there very poor people and very rich people? Or was there possibly a middle class?  Broken pieces of storage jars marked with a special identifier symbol from the lower town palace. (Photo courtesy of Tiffany-Earley-Spadoni) Encouraging Findings and a Promising Future The city s historical importance could be even greater if it is identified as Qabra, a major regional center referenced in Old Babylonian monuments like the famed Stele of Dadusha, according to Earley-Spadoni. There are many clues that give credence to the theory that Kurd Qaburstan was the prominent city of Qabra that has been referenced in Old Babylonian steles   or ancient monumental slabs. One such clue is that there are ample signs pointing to Kurd Qaburstan serving as a major regional administrative hub, she says.  Kurd Qaburstan is believed to be ancient Qabra, an important regional center mentioned in the records of other city-states,  Earley-Spadoni says.  The presence of writing, monumental architecture, and other administrative artifacts in the lower town palace further supports this identification since the site must have been an important city of its time.  The tablets are still being interpreted but there are some early encouraging findings that help illuminate the greater identity of the people of Kurd Qaburstan and the era they inhabited, she says.  The first of the three tablets was discovered in a trash-filled deposit along with building rubble and human remains,  she says.  Its context suggests dramatic events, possibly evidence of ancient warfare. We hope our work in 2025 will tell us more about this story.  The research and excavation efforts are funded through the U.S. National Science Foundation and in partnership with the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The work occurred from May to July 2024, with previous work conducted from 2013 to 2023 by a team from Johns Hopkins University that included Earley-Spadoni. Tiffany Earley-Spadoni has extensively studied Mesopotamian history and her efforts to excavate the site at Kurd Qaburstan have continued since 2013.

        "title": "Are we at a turning point in world history? | David Motadel",
        "content": "In 1919, at the height of a global crisis that resulted from the turmoil of the Russian Revolution, the devastation of the first world war, and the collapse of Europe s great continental empires, the Irish writer William Butler Yeats penned his famed warning to humanity, mourning the end of the old world:  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.  His words were recently invoked by Joe Biden, addressing the United Nations general assembly. Today, just as then, he warned, the world is facing a critical historical juncture:  I truly believe we are at another inflection point in world history where the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come.  The then president took the opportunity to offer some historical reflections. He recalled the global upheaval of the early 1970s, when he was first elected senator, at the height of the cold war, with wars raging from the Middle East to Vietnam, and a crisis simmering at home:  Back then, we were living through an inflection point, a moment of tension and uncertainty.  Throughout the 20th century, humankind had resolved major watershed crises. Today, with escalating wars from eastern Europe to the Middle East and with deepening divisions in our societies, it was time again, he urged, for concerted action. It was not the first time that Biden had historicized our time as an  inflection point  in world history. It has, in fact, become one of his signature political concepts, invoked in various speeches.  I ve said many times, we are at an inflection point,  he declared in his last foreign policy speech last week.  The post cold-war era is over. A new era has begun.  Many agree. The talk of  inflection points  has been echoed across the global political arena, as world leaders, among them the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, have adopted it to warn about the current geopolitical moment. The world today   marked by the global surge of autocratic powers and anti-democratic forces, the territorial conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Taiwan, the climate crisis, and a new unpredictable industrial revolution fueled by artificial intelligence   appears to be at a historic watershed. It is a moment that historian Adam Tooze dubbed as a  polycrisis . The phenomenon is not new, of course. Throughout history, the world has been rocked by major crises   political turmoil, wars and the downfall of great powers   which appeared earth-shattering at the time. And, routinely, contemporaries have declared them historical  turning points . The most striking of such events in modern history is the French Revolution, which fundamentally challenged the world s old monarchical order.  In two minutes the work of centuries was overturned,  the French revolutionary and writer Louis-S bastien Mercer celebrated in 1789.  Palaces and houses destroyed, churches overturned, their vaults torn asunder.  Even the critics of the revolutionary upheaval did not try to deny its profound historical significance.  The French Revolution is the most astonishing thing that hitherto happened in the world,  the conservative commentator Edmund Burke acknowledged in 1790.  Everything seems out of nature in this strange chaos of levity and ferocity and all sorts of crimes jumbled together.  In his lectures on the philosophy of history, given at the University of Berlin between 1822 and 1831, only a few decades after the storming of the Bastille, GWF Hegel noted that the significance of the French Revolution, with its  external expansion , had been  world historical . The turmoil of the revolutionary era, contemporaries agreed, was a critical historical juncture. Disillusionment followed. The turbulence of 1848 in Europe (and beyond) was also widely considered an inflection point. Revolutionaries across the continent celebrated that it was ushering in a new era of national awakening. Similarly, the years of the first world war were seen by contemporaries as a turning point of humanity. Woodrow Wilson considered it as a struggle that would  make the world safe for democracy ; HG Wells called it  the war to end war . After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Lenin claimed that the time had come for revolutionaries across  all countries and nations throughout the world  to change the course of history. Major mistakes made at that moment, from the ill-fated Versailles treaty to the ill-conceived League of Nations, paved the way for the next catastrophe. The second world war was routinely understood by wartime leaders as an inflection point, the  finest hour , that would be decisive in the triumph of democracy over tyranny. The end of the war, with the creation of the UN, Bretton Woods, Nato, and the European Coal and Steel Community, was hailed as a new era in the west, paving the way to prosperity. Likewise, the fall of the Berlin Wall seemed to spell the  end of history . Francis Fukuyama pondered whether the fundamental transformations of the time, which had engulfed  many regions in the world , would affect  world history . The triumph of liberalism was soon challenged by a global Islamist resurgence, an autocratic China and a revanchist Russia. The attacks of September 11 were seen by many contemporaries as another turning point.  For America, 9/11 was more than a tragedy,  George Bush remarked.  It changed the way we look at the world.  More generally, turning points or inflection points are major events in history that profoundly reshape our lives. One central characteristic of them is their irreversibility, as, afterwards, it seems impossible to return to the status quo ante. Unsurprisingly, political leaders, past and present, have also routinely invoked them, with some urgency, as ways to mobilize support for their cause. This has also allowed them to give their own time (and themselves, as actors or witnesses) historical significance. The major transformations and changes ... in history are always processes which evolve over decades and then become visible through certain events, or turning points Overall, inflection points, past and present, need to be taken seriously. Major moments in history have had irreversible consequences. Yet, we should be cautious not to obsess too much about the events as such. In fact, the fixation on turning points risks overlooking their deeper causes. To understand them, we need to take a sober look at the underlying structural transformations that produce them. In the end,  turning points  are always, at best, merely optical markers on the surface, the  crests of foam that the tides of history carry on their strong backs , as the historian Fernand Braudel put it. The major transformations and changes, the tectonic shifts, in history are always processes which evolve over decades and then become visible through certain events, or turning points. Historians have long studied historical turning points. This has involved questions about the significance or insignificance of certain events. It has also, more importantly, involved criticism of the search for (and the very idea of) turning points, based on the old controversy over the importance of  events  (and sudden changes) versus  structures  (and slow changes over time) in history. Historians have traditionally tended to look at earth-shattering events   wars, crises, revolutions, diplomatic deals   and the deeds of powerful individuals. This research reached its peak in the  great man  history of the 19th-century historicism centered on the German historian Leopold von Ranke. The concentration on great  events  provoked some criticism at the time, voiced by a wide range of scholars, most notably the historian Karl Lamprecht, economist Gustav Schmoller and sociologist Max Weber, who pointed to the importance of deeper social, economic and political transformations in shaping history, and the pitfalls of the idea of turning points. One of the most prominent of the critics was Karl Marx, who in his 1852 essay The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte memorablly declared:  Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past.  The most crushing criticism of the focus on events as turning points in history, however, came from the scholars of the French Annales school, such as Marc Bloch, Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel, who were interested in the deeper material and mental structures below the surface of events. In his 1949 magnum opus The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, Braudel, who coined term  structural history , explored the history of the Mediterranean on three levels: first, the history of the natural environment   geographical and geological conditions   which barely change over time; second, the social, economic and political structures, which slowly evolve, shaped by the natural environment; and third and least importantly, the events caused by human action, shaped by the conditions created by the first two levels. While environmental transformations and changes in social, economic and political structures must be studied over long periods, across generations, centuries, even millennia   the longue dur e   events can be studied within frameworks of days, weeks or years   the courte dur e. Braudel expressed deep mistrust about any fixation on dramatic short-term events   turning points   in conventional history writing. At first sight, he agreed, the past looks like a series of individual events. Yet, great political events and military defeats are actually much less significant on closer look. Sudden historical breaks are almost impossible. A focus on the surface, he warned, obscures the political, economic, social structures that make them possible. Indeed, there are many examples of turning points that turned out to be less momentous when studied as mere expressions of structural transformations. The year 1789 is impossible to understand without taking into account the deeper intellectual transformations, most notably the shifting ideas about society and the state rooted in the Enlightenment, and the profound material changes which led to tensions between nobility, clergy and commoners. Similarly, the moment of 1914 cannot be understood without considering the structures of international affairs, including secret diplomacy, and the rise of nationalism in the long 19th century. The turning point of 1989, likewise, was caused by the deepening economic stagnation of the Soviet Union, generational changes in Eastern Bloc leadership, and global ideological shifts. To understand September 11, we need to be aware of the long history of nativism, Islamism and anti-westernism in the global south. And so on. In all these cases, we need to grasp the underlying conditions if we are to understand the turning points they produced. Histories of great power politics, most notably Paul Kennedy s masterly Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, have long alluded to the deeper natural, economic and military structures that have created war and peace. To be sure, the focus on structures did, in turn, provoke some criticism. Some historians have argued that an idea of history in which individuals are prisoners of structural laws does not leave much room for human agency. Also, we, as humans and readers, prefer narratives involving human agency   stories of heroes and antiheroes   and dramatic events. Looking for (or reading about) deeper structures is far less enjoyable. It is therefore unsurprising that history books on turning points   wars and global crises   continue to rank at the top of our bestseller lists. There are now even books on specific years declared historical turning points by their authors: 1917, 1979 and so on. Some of them do show that the study of turning points can also take into account deeper causes. One of the most striking is Ian Kershaw s Fateful Choices on the inflection points of the second world war, such as Britain s decision to fight Nazi Germany, Hitler s invasion of the Soviet Union and Japan s attack on Pearl Harbor, which carefully addresses the structural conditions and constraints under which wartime leaders operated. Indeed, events and structures are not mutually exclusive. We should, in every case, acknowledge the relevance of both. As historian Reinhart Koselleck once noted:  The processual character of modern history cannot be comprehended other than through the reciprocal explanation of events through structures, and vice versa.  Structural economic, social and political conditions shape events. But on some junctures, events, such a political revolutions or major wars, can profoundly shape structures. The rare occasion when an event gains structural significance constitutes a historical inflection point. Today, world leaders are right to warn that we are facing such a historical inflection point, a global crisis. Yet, to fully understand it, to resolve it, we must not ignore its deeper structural causes, which often reach back to the end of the cold war and beyond. Among them are the resurgence of nationalism, cultural nativism and revanchism, now shaping political cultures around the world; unchecked neoliberal excess and exploitation, creating unsustainable inequalities; and the erosion of a rules-based international order, undermined by both liberal and illiberal powers over the last decades   all fueling wars and dividing societies. Noticing that we are at an inflection point is not enough. To overcome it, we need to tackle these underlying structural problems, which inevitably will be a slow process, not a dramatic deed. History is a long game.",

        "title": "Nuremberg Trials",
        "content": "Defendants, Nuremberg Trials US Army (Public Domain) The Nuremberg trials (1945-6), held in N rnberg (Nuremberg), Germany, were a series of trials involving the senior surviving Nazis to hold them accountable for waging war and committing war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Second World War (1939-45). 22 Nazis were tried, with 19 found guilty and sentenced to either death by hanging or lengthy prison terms. The first Nuremberg trials were conducted from November 1945 to October 1946, and then, a second phase, which involved a much larger number of defendants, was conducted from November 1946 to April 1949. The Nuremberg trials were the first in history where the victors in a war sought to make senior figures from the losing side accountable for their actions. The trials were filmed and contributed greatly to our understanding of how WWII was conducted and revealed both the irrefutable evidence for and enormous scale of such atrocities as the Holocaust. The first month of the trials, the initial proceedings only, were hosted in the Supreme Court Building in Berlin, but they moved on 20 November to the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg. The Palace of Justice was selected because it had been the heart of Nazi show trials against enemies of the Third Reich, the city was the home of the Nuremberg Rally, the infamous annual Nazi Party congress, and the complex had the practical advantage of an adjoining prison where the defendants were detained. Remove Ads  The International Military Tribunal At the close of WWII, the victorious Allies of France, Britain, the United States, and the USSR, as agreed by their respective leaders at a conference in Moscow back in October 1943, jointly formed an International Military Tribunal (IMT) to bring German Nazi war criminals to justice. There were some calls to have judges from neutral nations head the IMT, but the allied leaders were determined to be directly involved in getting their pound of flesh. The idea of the trials was supported by a number of other nations besides the four main powers. The legacy of the Nuremberg trials included raising awareness of the victims of Nazism & establishing a legal framework to prosecute war criminals. The panel that would decide the fate of the defendants brought before the IMT consisted of one judge and one prosecutor from each of the four nations mentioned above. The judging panel was presided over by the British judge Lord Justice Geoffrey Lawrence, described by one American lawyer as \"like God...Hollywood would have cast him\" (MacDonald, 23). The chief Soviet judge was I. T. Nikitchenko, the French lead judge was Henri Donnedieu de Vabres, and the US judge was Francis B. Biddle. The legal proceedings followed the common law practice applied in the United States and Britain. Translators worked in the courtroom, and everyone present had access to a set of headphones. There was a large screen to show the court relevant film clips and statistical information. 250 journalists attended the court sessions, and the whole proceedings were filmed and sound recorded. Remove Ads  Nuremberg Trials Judges U.S. Army (CC BY-NC-SA) In the closing stages of the war, Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), Joseph Goebbels (1897-1945), and Heinrich Himmler (1900-1945) had all committed suicide, but there remained 24 senior Nazi figures whom the Allies were determined to bring to justice. The group was selected not only for their individual roles but also as representatives of particular Nazi institutions. Before the trials could begin, Robert Ley (1890-1945), head of the German Labour Front, committed suicide, and Gustav Krupp (1870-1950), an industrialist who had used forced labour, was considered too physically frail to stand trial. The 22 remaining defendants faced four charges, as expressed in the Oxford Companion to World War II, they were: Count 1: Contributing to a common plan or conspiracy to wage war Contributing to a common plan or conspiracy to wage war Count 2: Crimes against peace Crimes against peace Count 3: War crimes (e.g. violations of the Geneva Convention such as the abuse and murder of prisoners of war, use of prisoners for labour, destruction of private property, and devastation of property and places with no military justification) War crimes (e.g. violations of the Geneva Convention such as the abuse and murder of prisoners of war, use of prisoners for labour, destruction of private property, and devastation of property and places with no military justification) Count 4: Crimes against humanity (e.g. the murder of civilian populations, use of slave labour, the forced deportation of civilians, and the persecution of specific social, political, religious, and racial groups) Counts 1 and 2 proved problematic to define, and therefore it was difficult to find the defendants either innocent or guilty of them. This is hardly surprising considering the debate amongst historians ever since as to why and how WWII started and how far one should go back exactly in order to discover the causes of WWII, causes which could be attributed in some cases to both the victors and losers. The court essentially considered counts 1 and 2 as involving actions such as breaking international treaties and invading and occupying free countries. Much easier to establish were cases of counts 3 and 4, although even here there was the added complication that the victors had themselves been guilty of what would today be called war crimes, for example, the Allied bombing of Germany, submarine attacks on unarmed vessels, and the Katyn Forest massacre of Polish prisoners of war by USSR forces. Certain facts were taken as given, such as that Hitler had fully intended to start a world war. In addition, such Nazi organisations as the Gestapo (secret police), the SS (Schutzstaffel), and SA (Sturmabteilung) were condemned as criminal organisations. Remove Ads  Palace of Justice, Nuremberg US Army (Public Domain) The judges not only benefitted from the cross-examination of the defendants but also the testimony of around 360 witnesses (including both victims of and members of the Nazi regime) and a huge quantity of incriminating documents, official and otherwise, including indisputable photographs, sound recordings, and films, such as those taken at concentration and death camps. As noted by Dr Robert Kempner, a lawyer who had fled the Nazi regime: One of the biggest helps to us was the German bureaucratic sense   they kept everything and they even made publications and films and lot of material had been discovered by our Allied search teams. Some of the people like General Governor Frank of Poland was so anxious to show his friend Hitler after the war what he has done that he kept diaries, volumes and volumes and volumes. In fact he had written his own indictment. (Holmes, 593) It is important to note, however, that the documentation for Nuremberg was compiled in order to support the legal case that the defendants were guilty of one or more of the four counts (and not to create a comprehensive reconstruction of past events as, say, a historian would do). There was, too, a degree of negotiation between the various national judges regarding particular defendants   the USSR judge, for example, wanted Rudolf Hess hanged while his fellow judges preferred a prison sentence   but there was a conscious effort on all parties to deliberate with as much fairness as possible given the seriousness of the trials and the world's scrutiny of them. To this end, the defendants were collectively represented by a legal counsel, Otto Kranzenb hler, and permitted individual lawyers to present their defence.

G ring was by far the most charismatic of those on trial, and he eloquently justified his past actions, although, in the process, he did no more than reveal his total lack of conscience for the gravity of them. According to Speer, G ring told him he was convinced the \"victors would undoubtedly kill him but that within fifty years his remains would be laid in a marble sarcophagus and he would be celebrated by the German people as a national hero and martyr\" (Speer, 681). Those who had belonged to the army or navy remained adamant that they should not be on trial at all since they were obeying military orders. Similarly, the civilians believed their actions, no matter how despicable, had been covered by the oath of loyalty they had once been obliged to swear to Hitler. Others pointed out that those in government should not be judged by standards usually applied to private individuals. Another argument of defence was that the victors had no legal right to put the losers on trial in the first place. Some, like Rosenberg and Streicher, were, in any case, completely unrepentant of their past actions. Dr Franz Blaha Giving Evidence at Nuremberg Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The simplistic, brutal thinking, or rather lack of thinking, of SS men like Kaltenbrunner and Frank was self-evident. Frick refused to testify at all during his trial. Speer cleverly tried to distance himself from his simpler and more notorious colleagues, constructing for himself a case that suggested he had merely been sucked into Nazism by Hitler's powerful personality. Indeed, Speer was one of the few to accept his guilt (although he is now known to have lied about his lack of knowledge of the Holocaust), or at least accept his part in what he described as a \"collective responsibility\" (Dear, 808) for the war and its consequences. Finally, Hess seemed on the fringes of lunacy, although he was not clinically diagnosed as insane. Hess annoyed G ring, his immediate neighbour in the dock, with his constant fidgeting and odd bursts of laughter. All in all, the 22 men looked rather pathetic in their civilian suits. Speer noted the effect of the absence of costume: \"For years I had been accustomed to seeing all these defendants in magnificent uniforms, either unapproachable or jovially expansive. The whole scene now seemed unreal; sometimes I imagined I was dreaming\" (678). The public and press were also surprised by how ordinary these arch-criminals looked. The novelist Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966) noted that only Kaltenbrunner looked anything like a criminal. Remove Ads  Each defendant was tried in turn, and even those who were cockiest at the beginning, such as G ring, were effectively silenced by the overwhelming mass of evidence against them. Indeed, the evidence was often so horrific and so repetitive that some journalists questioned the necessity of presenting it in such a methodical manner. Ultimately, through the course of the trial, the majority of the defendants themselves realised, if they had not done so already, that they had no defence against the charges brought before them. Final Sentences The defendants finally heard their fate on 1 October 1946. G ring committed suicide by swallowing a potassium cyanide pill a few hours before he was to be hanged. G ring's body was cremated, and his ashes were thrown in the ordinary rubbish. Those others who had been sentenced to death were hanged two weeks later on 16 October in the prison at Nuremberg. As a soldier, Keitel asked to be shot, but his request was denied. The bodies of the hanged men were cremated, and their ashes were scattered on the estuary of the Isar River. Those given prison terms at Spandau Prison in Berlin served various lengths of those terms, depending on their health. The last prisoner was Rudolph Hess, who committed suicide at the age of 93. Corpse of Joachim von Ribbentrop US Army (Public Domain) Subsequent Proceedings From November 1946 to April 1949, a further 185 Nazi war criminals faced trials organised by the United States military. These trials, conducted alone by the US authorities, are known as the US Nuremberg Military Tribunals. The majority of the defendants faced charges related to the inhuman treatment of, medical experimentation upon, and murder of civilians in Nazi concentration camps and the exploitation of civilians as labourers in industry. Of these defendants, 131 were found guilty, with 24 receiving the death sentence and the rest given prison terms. There were other post-WWII trials of war criminals, notably the Far East war crime trials, which dealt with Japanese war criminals, and trials in specific countries, particularly in Poland and the USSR. Germany conducted several denazification trials. There were also some reversals of earlier verdicts. Schacht was sentenced to eight years of hard labour (but only served two), while Alfred Jodl was exonerated by a German denazification court in 1953. By 1949, \"the Allies had convicted 5,025 people\" (Hite, 341). Many Nazi war criminals escaped capture, but the search for them went on, and some were ultimately brought to justice, often decades later. Such a figure, one of the chief administrators of the Holocaust, was Adolf Eichmann (1906-1962), apprehended in Argentina in 1960, tried in Israel, and then hanged. The legacy of the Nuremberg trials and those which followed included raising awareness of the victims of Nazism and establishing a framework on which international laws could be agreed upon. These laws could be used to hold leaders responsible for their actions and act as a deterrent to war crimes being committed. The Nuremberg trials provided a precedent, for example, for the trial of war criminals following the conflicts in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.",

        "title": "War of Jenkins' Ear: How One Man's Ear Started a Colonial War Between Empires",
        "content": "Battle of Cartagena de Indias, 1741 Unknown Artist (Copyright) The War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748) was a colonial conflict fought between Great Britain and Spain, primarily in the Caribbean and off the coast of South America. Looking to protect its interests in the West Indies, Britain provoked a war with Spain, one of its biggest colonial rivals, citing the mistreatment of one Captain Robert Jenkins, who was detained   and allegedly mutilated   by Spanish coast guards as they searched his ship for smuggled goods. In 1739, British Vice Admiral Edward Vernon sailed a fleet into the Caribbean, where he won some victories before his eventual defeat at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1741. After that climactic battle, the war fizzled out as the British soon had their hands full with other conflicts, such as the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748) in Europe and King George's War (1744-1748) in North America. Background Since the conclusion of Queen Anne's War (1702-1713), the European colonial powers in North America had enjoyed a relative period of peace. This was largely the work of Sir Robert Walpole, the leading British politician of the day, who became prime minister in 1721. Walpole and his Whig government believed that the British Empire would profit more from avoiding wars, both on the continent and overseas. Without the burdensome cost of military upkeep, Walpole was able to lower taxes while simultaneously working to pay off the national debt, with a sinking fund. Though many celebrated this pacifist policy, it was opposed by the Tories in Parliament, who feared that a non-combative Britain would soon fall behind its rivals, particularly in the Americas. The French, for example, were steadily expanding their influence in the West Indies, growing rich off their sugar plantations there. Should French meddling in the region go unopposed, then France would surely dominate the lucrative West Indies trade, at the expense of Britain's imperial interests. For these reasons, the Tories demanded a show of military force before it was too late. Remove Ads  Spain's overseas empire was not as powerful as it once was & was viewed by the British as bloated, decadent, & ripe for the taking. But even the hawkish Tories were aware that a direct war with France could lead to a long and costly struggle. Instead, they decided to assert their influence in the West Indies by picking on another target they deemed to be weaker: Spain. For centuries, the Spanish had dominated commerce in the West Indies with a trade network connected by four major ports: Veracruz, Portobelo, Cartagena de Indias, and Havana. But Spain's overseas empire was not as powerful as it once was and was viewed by the British as bloated, decadent, and ripe for the taking. Britain's hostility towards Spain was also fueled by an anti-Catholic, anti-Spanish stereotype called the 'Black Legend', in which Spaniards were painted as cruel and greedy brutes. For these reasons, the Tories clamored for a war with Spain, both to assert British dominance in the West Indies and to send a message to France by beating up its weaker ally. The Spanish, for their part, were not blind to Britain's expansionist desires and spent the period of peace watching the other colonial power with unease. Their suspicions seemed confirmed when, in 1732, the British founded a new colony, Georgia, right on the doorstep of Spanish Florida, increasing tensions on the mainland as well. Amidst all these rising tensions, Britain and Spain continued to trade in the West Indies. However, Spanish ports often imposed high tariffs on their goods, leading to an increase in smuggling. British smugglers would load up on Caribbean goods, particularly sugar, and take them to the Thirteen Colonies, where these luxuries were always in high demand. To crack down on such practices, the Spanish coast guard often patrolled the Caribbean Sea, stopping and searching any British vessel suspected of carrying contraband. Remove Ads  Map of Spanish Main & West Indies c.1720 Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) On 9 April 1731, a Spanish coast guard ship stopped one such vessel, the Rebecca, which had taken on quantities of sugar in Jamaica and was now bound for London. As the Spanish sailors searched the Rebecca, they detained its crew, including the captain, Robert Jenkins. Jenkins, according to his own disposition and some other accounts, was tied to the ship's mast with a rope around his neck and was hoisted into the air three times. The Spanish captain then sliced Jenkins's left ear with his cutlass, which was then torn off by another Spanish sailor. After threatening to treat King George II of Great Britain (reign 1727-1760) in the same manner, the Spaniards then left the Rebecca, returned to their own ship, and sailed off. The Rebecca continued on to London, where the one-eared Jenkins proceeded to tell his story to all who would listen. The story made some traction and was reported in several newspapers   including the Pennsylvania Gazette, edited by an up-and-coming Benjamin Franklin   but the scandal did not fully break until 1738. That year, Jenkins was granted an audience with the Privy Council and even appeared before King George II himself. According to one   likely apocryphal   version of events, Jenkins presented the king with his severed ear pickled in a jar as proof of his sorrowful mistreatment. Jenkins' tale outraged the British public, seeming to confirm their 'Black Legend' prejudices regarding Spanish cruelty. The Tories gained ground in Parliament, politicizing the incident to paint Walpole's Whig government as weak. In March 1739, Parliament passed a vote formally asking the king to seek redress from Spain, on behalf of both Jenkins and other British merchants who claimed to have been similarly mistreated. After Spain refused Britain's demands for restitution, George II declared war on 15 June 1739, an act that was ratified by Parliament four months later. Remove Ads  Vernon Arrives in the West Indies Shortly after the declaration of war, on 20 July 1739, British Vice Admiral Edward Vernon set sail for the West Indies with a fleet of Royal Navy warships. He arrived at Antigua in early October and immediately set about disrupting Spanish trade in the region. At the end of the month, he dispatched three ships under Captain Thomas Waterhouse to attack the Spanish port of La Guira in present-day Venezuela and to burn all the Spanish ships in the harbor. Aware that he could not simply blast his way into the port, Waterhouse decided to use deception to gain entry and ordered his vessels to hoist the Spanish flag. The Spaniards, however, had long been expecting an attack and were not fooled by the ruse. As soon as Waterhouse's three ships came within range of their port guns, the Spanish opened fire. The British ships took heavy damage and were forced to withdraw, limping back to Jamaica for repairs. Despite this setback, Vernon was undeterred. On 20 November, he sailed to Portobelo (in present-day Panama) with six ships of the line and captured it in under 24 hours. The British occupied Portobelo for three weeks, destroying its fortifications and seizing the two 20-gun coast guard ships in its harbor as prizes. Capture of Portobelo Samuel Scott (Public Domain) The victory at Portobelo was lauded across the British Empire; the capture of a major Spanish port was seen as a great success. Vernon was promoted to admiral, and the Walpole government was pressured into providing additional resources for the war effort. In the spring of 1740, Vernon looked to keep the momentum going by attacking another of the major Spanish ports, Cartagena de Indias, in present-day Colombia. Cartagena, if captured, would be an even more impressive prize than Portobelo. The city itself was heavily fortified and home to over 10,000 people. Its harbor, considered by some observers to be among the finest in the world, was where the Spanish galleons came to take on great quantities of gold and silver from the mines of Peru. Its capture, therefore, would greatly weaken Spain's hold on the West Indies trade. On 13 March 1740, Vernon arrived outside Cartagena with several ships of the line, 3 bomb vessels, 2 fire ships, and multiple transports carrying infantry. After spending a few days reconnoitering the position of the nearest Spanish fleet, Vernon ordered his bomb ships to begin bombarding the city. The Spanish, who had set up a temporary shore battery, returned fire and were able to prevent transport vessels carrying 400 British soldiers from landing. Vernon, finding the city's defenses stronger than anticipated, soon withdrew. His plans frustrated by the guns of Cartagena, Vernon sought to regain his mojo with another easy victory. On 22 March, he attacked the fortress of San Lorenzo on the Chagres River in Panama. His bomb ships pounded the fortress into submission, and the British admiral accepted the Spanish commander's surrender two days later. Like they had done at Portobelo, the British spent the next few weeks destroying San Lorenzo's fortifications and seizing guns, boats, and anything else of military value. Emboldened by this success, Vernon returned to Cartagena de Indias on 3 May, only to find that the Spanish had not been idle in his absence. A new viceroy, Sebasti n de Eslava y Lazaga, had arrived from Spain along with hundreds of seasoned reinforcements, boosting the port city's garrison to somewhere between 3 to 4,000 men (the defenders included 600 Indigenous archers). Having anticipated Vernon's coming, the Spanish arrayed six of their own ships of the line in the harbor to oppose him. This unexpected readiness gave Vernon pause. Rather than roll the dice on a battle and risk throwing away his earlier gains, he decided to once again withdraw to more thoroughly prepare for an attack. He would spend the next half year building an expedition force, one of the largest that a European power had yet deployed in the Americas. Remove Ads  Battle of Cartagena de Indias As many as 18,000 men died during the 67 days Vernon spent outside Cartagena's walls, most of them from disease. By the end of the year, Vernon had organized a military expedition worthy of Cartagena de Indias' strong defenses. He had put together a fleet of 124 ships, including 29 ships of the line, 22 frigates, several bomb ships, fire ships, and hospital ships, and over 80 transport vessels. The army component of the expedition consisted of 12,000 men, including two regiments of British regular infantry as well as 6,000 royal marines. This number also included four battalions of colonial troops   3,600 men in total   who had been raised in the Thirteen Colonies. Under the competent leadership of Governor Alexander Spotswood of Virginia, these colonial soldiers were set to rendezvous with Vernon's fleet in Jamaica before the entire force completed its journey to Cartagena. But no sooner had Vernon laid out his grand plans than dire complications arose. In June 1740, Governor Spotswood died in Annapolis, depriving the colonial battalions of their leader. Six months later, Lord Cathcart, who had been slotted to serve as commander-in-chief of the expedition's land forces, also fell ill and died while crossing the Atlantic from London. To make matters worse, as the expedition gathered in Jamaica, the ships' crews and the soldiers aboard the transports began to suffer from diseases like scurvy, typhus, and dysentery. By January 1741, sickness had already killed 500 men and incapacitated 1,500 more. After forcing 300 enslaved Africans into service to replace his dead sailors, Vernon raised anchor, and his formidable fleet set sail for Cartagena de Indias. The Spaniards, meanwhile, were readying themselves to meet this threat. In charge of the city's defense was Admiral Blas de Lezo, a man who was already a veritable legend on the high seas; having lost an arm, a leg, and an eye in previous battles, he was known as Patapalo, or 'Pegleg', and Mediohombre, or 'Half-man' (at least, he was referred to as such in later sources; there is scant evidence he was known by these nicknames in his own lifetime). Aware that he was heavily outnumbered, de Lezo hoped to hold out long enough to wear the British down through attrition, betting that, unused to the tropical diseases, their numbers would quickly dwindle. On 13 March 1741, the British expedition arrived outside Cartagena. With Lord Cathcart dead, there was no central army commander, and Vernon often found himself bickering with the army officers. Still, the British commanders agreed that any attack from the ocean would be impossible, as Cartagena's walls were too strong. Instead, they would have to gain entry through a narrow, deep-water channel called Boca Chica and assault the city's outer defenses from there. This channel, however, was well-defended by two bastions: Fort San Jose on one side and Fort San Luis on the other. Blas de Lezo Unknown Artist (CC BY) For the next several weeks, Vernon directed all his firepower on Fort San Luis. Eventually, the British made a breach in its walls and landed their infantry and royal marines in preparation for an assault. On 5 April, the British attacked Fort San Luis by both land and sea. But when the British regulars poured in through the breach, they found the Spanish defenders gone; de Lezo had pulled his men back to the inner fortification of Castillo San Felipe de Barajas the previous night. Though the British had seized control of the city's outer fortifications, it had taken them a month to do so   with more men falling sick and dying every day, they were running out of time. In his desperation to conclude the siege, Vernon drew up a plan for a risky frontal assault on Castillo San Felipe. In the early morning hours of 20 April, 2,000 British and colonial soldiers under Colonel John Grant attempted to storm the fort with ladders. They ran right into the waiting muskets of 1,000 Spanish soldiers, who de Lezo had entrenched below the walls of the fort proper. Repeated volleys of the Spanish muskets stopped the British assault in its tracks, a situation made worse when Cartagena's cannons began to open fire. Once the British began to waver, the Spanish leapt from their trenches and drove them back with a spirited bayonet charge. Remove Ads  By the time the battle was over, the British had lost 600 men, including Colonel Grant, who was killed. Vernon saw the writing on the wall and realized he had neither the time nor the men for another attack. On 9 May, he lifted the siege and returned to Jamaica. As many as 18,000 of his men died during the 67 days he spent outside Cartagena's walls, most of them from disease. The Spanish lost less than 2,000. Of the colonial troops who had served under Vernon, barely 300 survived to return to the Thirteen Colonies. One of these was Lawrence Washington, the elder half-brother of George Washington, future first president of the United States. Lawrence had been sufficiently impressed with his commanding admiral to name his property in Virginia 'Mount Vernon' in his honor. Vernon himself had reached the zenith of his military career. After lackluster success in 1742, he was recalled to Britain. The Walpole government, too, could not survive the disaster of the Cartagena expedition, and Walpole resigned as prime minister in 1742. Thus, the Spanish victory at Cartagena marked the most important moment of the war, not only thwarting Britain's expansionist ambitions but also shaking up its government. Edward Vernon Thomas Gainsborough (Public Domain) War in Florida & Georgia As Vernon was grappling with the Spaniards in the West Indies, warfare also broke out in North America, between the British colony of Georgia and Spanish Florida. Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1739, Major General James Oglethorpe, the founder of Georgia, was instructed by King George II to  annoy the subjects of Spain in the best manner  (quoted by APUSH). Heeding this royal decree, Oglethorpe led 200 men into Florida in December, seizing forts Picolata and San Francisco de Pupo, both situated west of St. Augustine. In May 1740, Oglethorpe returned to Florida with 1,200 men, including Georgia militia and Indigenous allies from the Creek, Chickasaw, and Uchee nations. They laid siege to St. Augustine itself, but due to logistical difficulties, they were forced to lift the siege in July. Oglethorpe returned to Georgia, where he built a fort on the Frederica River in preparation for the inevitable Spanish counterattack. Such an attack would manifest in the spring of 1742 when Manuel de Montiano, governor of Florida, led 4,000 men into Georgia. On 18 July 1742, the Spanish were advancing along the road to Fort Frederica when they encountered a contingent of Georgia rangers and Native American warriors. Taken by surprise, the Spanish were soon driven back. Oglethorpe took advantage of this small victory by leading the rest of his men out of the fort in pursuit of the retreating Spanish. That same day, he caught up with them, and the two forces clashed at the Battle of Bloody Marsh. Familiar with the terrain, Oglethorpe's Georgia militia and Native American warriors took cover in the dense vegetation, giving them clear shots at the Spanish troops who remained out in the open. When his men started running low on ammunition, Montiano ordered a retreat and ultimately withdrew back into Florida. In March 1743, Oglethorpe led yet another raid into Florida with the goal of capturing St. Augustine. However, he once again met with failure and retreated back into Georgia. This marked the end of the fighting along the Georgia-Florida border for the remainder of the war. End of War By and large, Vernon's failed assault on Cartagena de Indias marked the end of the war. Shortly after that, the War of Jenkins' Ear   as the conflict would come to be called   would be overshadowed by other wars breaking out all over the world. In Europe, Britain had been drawn into the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740, and in 1744, it would face off with France in North America in King George's War. Though Britain and Spain remained at war, the subsequent battles were more associated with these other conflicts, except for minor privateer actions in the West Indies. It was not until 1748 that the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended all these wars. The treaty stipulated that the situation in the West Indies return to the way it had been before the war, and that British smuggling in the region cease. Thus, the War of Jenkins' Ear was effectively a Spanish victory.",

        "content": "Florentine Codex Bernardino de Sahag n (CC BY-NC-ND) The Florentine Codex is an encyclopedic accounting of life in 16th-century Mexico and an invaluable resource for understanding the exchange between European and Indigenous cultures during the Spanish conquest. Emerging from a time of societal upheaval, the codex was written as an attempt to record the culture and beliefs of the Aztec peoples of Mexico in the areas surrounding the once great city of Tenochtitlan. The work covers a broad array of topics, including religion, everyday life, native flora and fauna, and Indigenous perspectives on the conquest itself. Written at a time when Spanish authorities had been and still were actively undermining Aztec culture and beliefs, the Florentine Codex represents an attempt to document and preserve a past and people being systematically censored. It is the product of many minds in collaboration, written in two different languages by numerous scribes and illuminated by a number of artists employing a uniquely syncretic style of illustration, all of which comes together to create a multifaceted depiction of the culture, language, and history of Aztec civilization immediately following the fall of the empire. Remove Ads  Contents The Florentine Codex was completed sometime between the fall of 1575 and the spring of 1577 after nearly 30 years in the making. Composed of 12 illuminated books with a total of 2,446 pages and 2,472 illustrations, it is widely attributed to a Franciscan friar known as Fray Bernardino de Sahag n (1499-1590). Though the modern title of the codex comes from the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, where it is housed today, scholars do not know what the original title was at the time of its completion. Sahag n himself referred to the text variously in his native Spanish as doze libros ( \"twelve books\"), obra (\"work\"), and, perhaps most expansively, Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva Espa a (\"General History of the Things of New Spain\"). While the codex certainly contains history, its scope is greater than even that title might suggest. The contents of the Florentine Codex are summarized below: Book 1: Prologue and the Gods Book 2: Ceremonies of the Aztec Calendar Book 3: Origin of the Gods and Mythology Book 4: Astrology and Divinatory Practices Book 5: Omens Book 6: Rhetoric and Moral Philosophy Book 7: Natural Philosophy and Celestial Phenomena (Sun, Moon, and Stars) Book 8: Lords of Tenochtitlan, Tlaltelolco, Tetzcoco, and Huexotla, Education and Customs of These Lords Book 9: Merchants, Craftsmen, and Artisans Book 10: The People, Occupations, and Anatomy Book 11: Earthly Things, Natural History Book 12: Conquest of Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco from the Indigenous Perspective The folios of this impressive work include text in two languages: Spanish, the language of the intended audience of the codex, and Nahuatl, the language of the Indigenous peoples of Mexico. While the text is bilingual, neither language represents a translation of the other. Instead, the texts exist in parallel, the Spanish frequently interpreting, abbreviating, adding to, or omitting information from the content of the Indigenous language. For this reason, modern scholars have stressed the need to read the two texts in conjunction rather than one on behalf of the other: Though the entries can be read side by side, their meanings are not always in harmony. There is an ebb and flow in the presence of the Spanish and Nahuatl texts; sometimes there is less written in one language than the other, sometimes one is absent from a folio altogether, and even when they are both present, readers might find inconsistencies in their tone, meaning, or content. Remove Ads  The images in the Florentine Codex integrate artistic elements from native traditions with the conventions of European traditional styles. Alongside the two languages, the Florentine Codex is punctuated with illustrations. The images in the codex include both decorations and compositions; many are painted in vivid color, while others are rendered only in ink outline, but all of them were illustrated by native artists over the course of years. In the 16th century, images were efficient and impactful ways of conveying information across linguistic and ideological barriers and became a common means of communicating messages in the early colonial world. Painted cloths, wall art, prints, banners, and other means of pictorial expression became tools for religious, political, and social communication, especially in the early days when only a few individuals could translate between Nahuatl and Spanish, much less the other languages spoken in Mesoamerica at the time. The images in the Florentine Codex represent an entirely separate mode of communication, and one with which both cultures would have been intimately familiar, though in different ways. In the Nahuatl language, Indigenous painter-writers were known as tlacuiloque (singular tlacuilo), and were heirs to an artistic tradition that stretched back centuries before the European colonization of the Americas. Created by such skilled artisans, the images in the Florentine Codex are stylistic adaptations, integrating artistic elements from native traditions with the format and conventions of the European traditional styles, particularly the convention that favored formal isolation of subjects within the layout of the page. While the presentation of the images is generally more European in style, there are several examples of Aztec artistic conventions in the Florentine Codex. These include the use of curling symbols called \"speech scrolls\" to indicate a speaking individual in a static image, and the practice of depicting seashells on the edges of tendrils of water. Both of these stylistic elements appear in the image of Chalchiuhtlicue from the Codex Borbonicus, which was created by Aztec priests and preserves many pre-Hispanic modes of pictorial representation. Remove Ads  Chalchiuhtlicue Unknown Artist (Public Domain) While the texts address audiences in the languages of two cultures, the images of the Florentine Codex represent the clearest examples of the cultural syncretism at play in 16th-century Mexico: Such a work could have been produced only in Mesoamerica, where the introduction of the Roman alphabet and European art style made sense to people who had been writing and painting with ink and natural colors for centuries. It is among the rare first manuscripts to represent indigenous cultures that involved indigenous people. (Peterson & Terraciano, 13) Sahag n's Collaborators While Fray Bernardino de Sahag n is considered the author of the Florentine Codex, it was actually a product of a substantial collaborative effort and featured the contributions of people from Mexico's Indigenous communities as its primary content. That being said, the codex would have been impossible without Sahag n, whose role included writing, coordinating, editing, and translating, in addition to proposing the actual idea of and advocating for the project itself. Considering the extensive subject matter and sheer volume of scribal and artistic labor involved, one man, even one as ambitious as Sahag n, could not have accomplished the ambition of this project alone. Sahag n was a teacher and missionary absolutely dedicated to the conversion of the native people of Mexico to Catholic Christianity. He believed that in order to accomplish his goal, he had to understand the belief systems, culture, and language that had preceded the colonial influence of Spain. After all, missionaries could not ideologically eclipse a religion they could not recognize and could not convey Christianity without sharing a common language with their prospective converts. But Sahag n and his peers in the church had come to Mexico after the conquest and had little to no knowledge of Aztec civilization. In order to accomplish his ultimate evangelical aim, Sahag n had to rely on information from those he sought to convert. Remove Ads  Aztec Musicians Madman2001 (Public Domain) Beyond just content, Sahag n needed help with the recording process. The nearly 2,500-page Florentine Codex was drafted multiple times over the course of three decades through the concerted efforts of a number of steady-handed and literate men. These men were intellectuals, born in Mexico to Indigenous parents and then educated at colleges  and staffed by the Spanish church. They, like Sahag n himself, were fluent in Nahuatl, Spanish, and Latin, and were instrumental in the creation of the codex, a process that occurred largely in the later years of Sahag n's life, when age rendered the friar incapable of writing anything himself with his own trembling hands. Though he was certainly the author of the prologues and parts of the Spanish text, those sections represent less than half of the content of the Florentine Codex. Creating the Codex From 1559 to 1565, Sahag n and his collaborators collected what would become the Florentine Codex in conversation with elders in the settlements of Tepepulco and Tlatelolco. During his time in Tepepulco, Sahag n worked with local authorities to assemble a group of approximately twelve elders. These elders had all lived through the cataclysmic arrival of Hern n Cort s and his forces and could offer their knowledge of the pre-Hispanic Aztec culture to Sahag n's project. After the friar and his team of scribal scholars recorded their spoken testimony, the elders offered images representing what they had said. As mentioned above, Aztec tlacuiloque had kept history and culture in pictorial records long before the advent of the Roman alphabet in Mexico. After three years in Tepepulco, Sahag n and his nascent codex were transferred to Tlatelolco, where he once again presented his intentions and requested leaders from among the native peoples. With about ten more elders, all of whom were capable and knowledgeable in Nahuatl and the preconquest customs of the Aztecs, Sahag n and his team proceeded to expand on, clarify, and revise the work. Remove Ads  Map of the Aztec Empire, c. 1427 1521 Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) When the friar concluded his interviews in Tlatelolco around 1565, his collaboration had produced what is known today as the C dices Matritenses or Madrid Codices, an early draft of the Florentine Codex. Like its later iteration, the Madrid Codices are written in Spanish and Nahuatl, but unlike the Florentine Codex, the 1565 draft is not illustrated and includes three columns of text. The left columns, written in Spanish, encompass Sahag n's notes on the same subjects addressed in the central columns, all of which were written in Nahuatl on specific topics. The columns furthest to the right, which do not appear in the Florentine Codex, articulated Sahag n's lexical notes on the Nahuatl language. The friar had planned to include the third column in the Florentine Codex as well, but a lack of time and support, in Sahag n's own estimation, prevented his culminating work from being the linguistic resource he had intended it to be. At this point, Sahag n describes editing, dividing the content into twelve books and sorting the text into specific chapters and paragraphs. He writes: The Mexicans corrected and added many things to the twelve books as they were being copied anew, in such a way that the first sieve through which my works were strained was that of Tepepulco; the second, that of Tlatelolco; the third, that of Mexico. (Book 2, folios 1v-2r, translated by Garc a Garagarza) Among the hands and minds that sieved his works, the friar mentions a few by name. Though it does not represent a complete list of his Indigenous collaborators, Sahag n mentions Mart n Jacobita, who was director of the colegio of Tlatelolco, Antonio Valeriano, who was a native of Azcapotzalco, and two natives of Cuauhtitlan named Alonso Vegerano and Pedro de San Buenaventura, all of whom were experts in Latin, Spanish, and Nahuatl. In his list of scribes, he includes Diego de Grado and Bonifacio Maximiliano, both natives of Tlatelolco, and Mateo Severino from Xochimilco. Peterson and Terraciano assert that there were many other unnamed collaborators from the communities surrounding Lake Texcoco that contributed to the final product. Sahag n ultimately delivered a book containing far more than was necessary to convert the native population to Christianity. He created a vehicle through which Nahuatl authors and artists of the 16th century can still be heard and seen today. Aztec Agriculture Peter Isotalo (Public Domain) Sahag n's Goals In his prologue to Book 1, Sahag n articulates multiple aims for the practical use of the Florentine Codex. The first of his goals naturally centers on his role in converting the native population. Likening the work of missionaries to physicians tasked with diagnosing and treating illnesses, he claims that as physicians care for the body, priests and confessors are meant to minister to the souls of those whom they aim to convert to Christianity. In order to accomplish that task, he asserts that it was necessary to record accurate accounts of the language and beliefs of the Indigenous peoples of Mexico before the Spanish conquest. These linguistic and anthropological endeavors become the other stated goals of the codex. Sahag n makes it clear that one of his goals is to demonstrate the worth of the peoples who had suffered devastation at the hands of Cort s. The presence of so much Nahuatl language in the codex represents the scope of Sahag n's dedication to this goal. By 1540, well before initiating the project that would become the Florentine Codex, he had already authored a number of sermons in Nahuatl, enough to be delivered at all of the saints' days and Sundays of the year. He had tailored these to the Indigenous people, both the nobility and the lower classes, not just in their language but according to the aptitude he recognized in them at the time. As he learned more, the friar would find that their capacity not only exceeded his expectations but evoked in him a profound respect for their way of life, which would inform and enhance his convictions in his anthropological aim. While it is not clear exactly when this sentiment formed for Sahag n, he makes it clear that one of his goals is to demonstrate the worth of the peoples who had suffered devastation at the hands of Cort s and his forces. Early in the Florentine Codex, Sahag n quotes an Old Testament prophecy attributed to Jeremiah, asserting the similarities between the prophetic portents and the fate of the Indigenous peoples in the conquest of Mexico: Love History?

This people shall destroy you, and your women and children, and everything that you possess; and they shall destroy all your towns and buildings.\" This, to the letter, has happened to these Indians at the hands of the Spaniards. They were so utterly trampled upon and destroyed, with all of their things, that no resemblance was left of what they were before. (Book 1, folio vir, translated by Garagarza) Sahag n further laments that the native peoples are perceived as barbarians despite the fact that their styles of governing, as he puts it, are \"far ahead of many other nations that presume to be highly civilized\" (Book 1, folio vir, translated by Garagarza). Atlalli Aztec Irrigation The Florentine Codex (CC BY-NC-ND) Sahag n continues his praise of the Indigenous people particularly their educational systems, rhetoric, and achievements in arts, sciences, and technologies throughout the rest of the Florentine Codex and even compares the cultures of Mesoamerica to Troy, Rome, Carthage, and Venice, emphasizing their similarities to those highly esteemed civilizations of Europe. While he qualifies all of this praise with a notion of Mesoamerica being a place apart from the influence of God, where the devil has enjoyed prosperity, he nonetheless situates the native peoples of the Americas as kin to the Spanish and as mutual descendants of Adam. Suppression of the Codex In writing to his Spanish audience, whose perspectives likely would have been influenced by biased accounts from the conquistadors, Sahag n went far to assert the worth of the culture and heritage of Mexico's Indigenous population. In some ways, he went much further than would have been comfortable to his fellow Spaniards: For Spanish officials, particularly ecclesiastical authorities, words in native tongues were inherently suspect and images potentially idolatrous; translation itself might camouflage heretical ideas and harbor dangerous political meanings. (Peterson & Terraciano, 14) Almost certainly aware of this idolatrous potential, Sahag n still championed a text largely written in Mexico's native tongue and richly illustrated by Indigenous artists. Even when King Phillip II of Spain (reign 1556-1598) ordered the confiscation of all manuscripts involving Indigenous history and religion in 1577, Sahag n may have withheld a copy of his codex, in defiance of the Crown, and offered to copy and send it again to be sure it was received. The codex was sent to Europe in the year of the decree, was acquired by the Medici family in 1587, and disappeared from the historical record for nearly two centuries. The codex was rediscovered in 1793, but was not actually studied until 1879, and was inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2015.",

        "content": "Bodo was a early 9th-century Frankish farmer. He and his family hailed from a manor owned by the monastery of St.-Germain-des-Pr s near Paris and worked as its tenants. He ploughed the farmlands while his wife, Ermentrude, took care of their household. Their lives give us a lively image of what daily life was like as peasants living in a manor in the Carolingian world of the early Middle Ages. Manors formed the very basic economic and social structure of early medieval Europe. A land estate owned by a feudal lord, not only was the manor the heart of agricultural production, it was also a centre for local political, social, and cultural activities. The monastery of St.-Germain-des-Pr s kept a detailed list of the names of the tenants and other people doing business with them of this period, called the Polyptych. Remove Ads  Detail of March from Les Tr s Riches Heures Mark Cartwright (CC BY-NC-SA) To manage their large estate, the then abbot of the monastery, Irminon (c. 820s), compiled this list, and the text is now preserved in a 9th-century manuscript in Paris (Biblioth que nationale de France, Ms Latin 12832). Along with Bodo were 10,000 other names located in 25 different villages, detailing their names, occupations, and most importantly, the sort of obligations (rent and labour) owed to the monastery. It was from this fiscal data that we can track and reconstruct the life of Bodo and his wife as well as their three unnamed children. Social Status & Experience Before discovering details of their daily lives, it is important to first note the social status of Bodo and his family, as this was very important in determining what was expected of them. Bodo and his family were not slaves and thus enjoyed a degree of freedom, but it is also true that the state of being enslaved and free was not binary in the Middle Ages, and often, it is more precise to talk about the degree of (un)freeness or freedom a person enjoyed under various circumstances. Remove Ads  it is crucial to note the state of being enslaved and free was not binary Christianity formally forbids slavery, but in actual practice it was more about how free and (un)free was one's experience in social, economic and political spaces since the breaking down of the western parts of the Roman Empire. In the old Romanland that now belonged to the various Germanic tribes and the kingdoms they established, there were coloni, free framers only in a sense that they were not subjected to anyone s servitude, but they were, nevertheless, bounded by and depended on their lands and thus had little mobility. Then we have serfs, who were attached to and depended on the estates of their owners. While a serf could not be sold as a person, they were sometimes exchanged during a land transaction. Other than the land labour, serfs also had to perform other household work for their owners. Lastly, there were free peasants who owned the land and were responsible for their own gains and losses. As freemen, they did not owe any rent or labour and could even provide paid work to feudal rulers. Their independence, however, was fragile, as any crop failure or any unfortunate circumstances like the population plundering from other lords could lead to them being subjected to a feudal ruler and becoming coloni or even serfs. Polyptych of Irminon, folio 2r Biblioth que nationale de France. D partement des Manuscrits (Public Domain) Bodo and his family were attached to the monastery and had a variety of obligations to it. This was what the Polyptych of Irminon recorded. They lived in one of the villages with other peasants of similar status. We know some of Bodo's neighbours  names: Frambert, Ermoin, and Ragenold, and they all had their own family. The circle of peasant farmers and workers was likely the most common social relationship Bodo could forge. He might meet the estate manager from time to time, and even the people from the monastery itself. But the monastery was a closed community, and outside visits were a rarity. Only a traveling merchant might visit the monastery on occasions, although even a royal visit was not impossible, and for someone like Bodo, the sight of a great king or noble marching on the road, perhaps with a newly received gift from a distant Caliph such as an elephant, could be the view, talk, and memory of a lifetime. Remove Ads  Daily Routine Bodo and Ermentrude had busy days throughout the year, and only on rare occasions and important festivals or religious holidays could they find some rest and enjoy a break from the many obligations they had. Bodo had to wake up early and go to the farm of the monks with the other peasants, as this was their main labour. They had to bring their own tools for ploughing and certain gifts (eggs, vegetable etc) to bribe the steward there for an easy day. The obligations Bodo shared were divided into the following: Field work, which was a fixed amount of labour on the land, Corv e, meaning unfixed ploughing when needed, and lastly, military service, in the form of paying money or supplying livestock to the soldiers. There was, too, public service, that is, participating in the maintenance of the village infrastructure whenever needed. Any day could be a trial of hardship for Bodo, and the work must often have seemed endless from morning to evening, as one early medieval writer imagined:  Oh sir, I work very hard. I go out in the dawning, driving the oxen to the field and I yoke them to the plough every day I must plough a fall acre or more, after having yoked the oxen and fastened the share and coulter to the plough  Yes, indeed it is very hard work!' (Aelfric, Colloquium, in The Welding of the Race, 449-1066, p95) The Feudal Society in Medieval Europe Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) Ermentrude also had a busy life. She had to work in the workshop with other women, spinning, dyeing, and sewing garments as well as making other daily accessories. Carolingian kings, in their legislation, provided a very detailed list of what was expected of a peasant woman s daily labour: For our women s work, they are to give at the proper time the materials, that is linen, wool, woad, vermillion, madder, wool combs, teasels, soap, grease, vessels, and other objects which are necessary. And let out women s quarters be well look after, furnished with houses and rooms with stoves and cellars, and let them be surrounded by a good hedge, and let the doors be strong, so that the women can do out work properly. (Charlemagne s capitulary, De Villis, c.45) After fulfilling her part of the tenant s obligations, Ermentrude then needed to go to the small family farm and work on it. This included looking after the livestock and watering the vegetables. Only after all these tasks had been completed could she return to her own household to look after the children, prepare meals for them, clean the house, and make new clothes for the family for the winter to come. Remove Ads  When Bodo returned at the end of the working day, the family would immediately eat supper and then go to bed, for a day s labour was physically exhausting for both adults, and opportunities for rest did not come too often during the working day. Nor would they have much by way of evening entertainment, for after sunset, darkness shrouded the entire house. Sleep was what both men and women who worked tirelessly on the farmlands, workshops, and household needed, for tomorrow would be no different than today or yesterday. February, Les Tres Riches Heures Limbourg Brothers (Public Domain) The Medieval Agricultural Revolution There was a substantial decline in agricultural intensity across the post-Roman West which can be measured by the decrease in buildings, trade networks, and the quality of the agricultural production, both primary like grain and secondary such as coins or pottery. However, by the later first millennium, at least in northwestern Europe, some major trends that had slowly taken place allowed a recovery, if not intensification, of agricultural production. First, instead of the Two-field System, farmers began to adopt the Three-field System. The Two-field System meant farmland was divided into two sections, with crops growing on one half of it while the other half was left ploughed and harrowed but not sowed. Under the new pratice, one third of the land would be sown with winter crops and one third summer ones, allowing greater food production through a more fertile land. As a result, food surpluses became increasingly common and there was a stable growth of population that saw the number of households almost doubled. More farmlands were cultivated and trade beyond the local community started to appear. There was also a small and localized urbanization, as either the villages located in the pre-existing key trading route or recently brought into the commercial network experienced a fair degree of population and infrastructural growth. Remove Ads  What did all this mean for peasants like Bodo? For once, they would have another way out of the very land that provided their life but also tied them to it. All of Bodo and Ermentrude s three children would have a better chance of surviving the world and more opportunities to explore it. This was not to paint a better picture in general, because by all accounts peasants like Bodo were still very much subjected to economic, social, and political oppression from the powerful. But in some ways that would be eventually transformative of the entire medieval European world, peasants firsthand experienced the benefits of the changes in land production, and their lives became somewhat improved. Conclusion The story of Bodo was reconstructed from the manorial record of the monastery of St.-Germain-des-Pr s. Other than being an important spiritual centre, the monastery also operated as the economic hub of the newly formed Carolingian Empire. Keeping a detailed and accurate record of tenants like Bodo was essential for the purposes of taxation, military service, land transactions, and other forms of economic exchange between the peasants, the monastery, and the court. Regarding the kings and emperors, whose luxurious lifestyle had to be sustained by the labour of the peasants, much has been written on them. Yet 99 percent of medieval people were just like Bodo, or Ermentrude and their three unnamed children, whose destinies were closely tied to the fortune of the land in early medieval Europe, and all we have on them, and on their world, is the Polyptych. While this was but a glimpse into their lives, the Polyptych makes possible to see the working of an early medieval manor, and the people who spent their entire life in it with very little possibilty of ever experiencing the greater outside world.",

Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The Trenches of WWI Despite Germany's hopes that its prepared Schlieffen Plan would win a swift victory over France and its allies, the First World War settled down on the Western Front to a static one of trench warfare. Other fronts developed in Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers poured into these fronts from all sides involved in the conflict, many amongst them keen for action and eager to do their patriotic duty. The public was equally enthusiastic in the early days of the war. One French infantry officer recalls the scene as his train carrying troops to the front set off from Paris: Remove Ads   without any signal, the train slowly steamed out of the station. At that moment, quite spontaneously, like a smouldering fire suddenly erupting into roaring flames, an immense clamour arose as the Marseillaise burst from a thousand throats. All the men were standing at the train's windows, waving their k pis. From the track, quais and the neighbouring trains, the crowds waved back Crowds waved back at every station, behind every barrier, and at every window along the road. Cries of 'Vive la France! Vive l'arm e' could be heard everywhere, while people waved handkerchiefs and hats. The women were throwing kissed and heaped flowers on our convoy. The young men were shouting: \"Au revoir! A bient t\" [Goodbye. See you soon!]. (Keegan, 72) A similar zeal for battle was seen across the world and, undeniably, there quickly built up a pressure from peers and society to 'join up and do one's bit', as here recalled by one New Zealand soldier: University classes emptied sports fixtures were abandoned. To be left behind was unthinkable. If your mate was going, then somehow you had to get away too. (Keegan, 242) Sentry Post, Western Front 1918 T.K.Aitkin - Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Canadian soldier Victor Wheeler recalls the impact on local French farmers as war descended on them by chance in October 1914: Remove Ads  With pick and shovel we dug trenches through beautiful fields of grain, fully realising what damage we were doing to the farmers' hopes of reaping small harvests that would enable them to stem hunger during the coming winter. The patriarch with his ox-drawn plough, the matronly gleaner, and the young woman gathering grass and leaves, stood arms akimbo, wordlessly, helplessly, hopelessly watching. The depressing effect on the morale of the men   to many of whom raising grain on the Western prairie also meant their livelihood   could not be easily dismissed. (Yorke, 28) The reality of trench warfare soon set in. Ernst J nger, a German soldier, gives the following description of the trench he lived and fought in: To rest in, there are dugouts, which have evolved by now from rudimentary holes in the ground to proper enclosed living quarters, with beamed ceilings and plank-cladded walls. The dugouts are about six feet [1.8 m] high, and at a depth where there floors are roughly level with the bottom of the trench outside. In effect, there is a layer of earth on top of them thick enough to enable them to survive oblique hits. In heavy fire, though, they are death-traps The whole thing should be pictured as a huge, ostensibly inert installation, a secret hive of industry and watchfulness, where, within a few seconds of an alarm being sounded, every man is at his post. But one shouldn't have too romantic an idea of the atmosphere, there is a certain prevailing torpor that proximity to the earth seems to engender. (J nger, 40-41) Machine guns and artillery shells caused total carnage amongst infantry troops unimaginatively deployed again and again by their generals to cross the no man's land between rival trench systems. A German soldier, F. L. Cassell, recalls: Remove Ads   the shout of the sentry, 'They are coming' Helmet, belt and rifle and up the steps in the trench a headless body. The sentry had lost his life to a last shell there they come, the khaki-yellows, they are not twenty metres in front of our trench They advance slowly fully equipped machine-gun fire tears holes in their ranks. (Keegan, 295) Medical Officer, British Trenches, 1918 T.K.Aitkin - Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) In those trenches between Allied and Turkish troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula, a similar story is recorded by British soldier Vere Hamsworth in a letter home: We spent four days in the front-line trench. We had only a few casualties. We were put there just after a big attack which had partially failed and the ground between our trench and the Turks were strewn with bodies. It strikes me that they will be there for a long time. In this the body and face turn quite black in less than 24 hours and the smell is terrific. The flies   which are everywhere   also add to the general discomfort. (Williams, 37) New weapons used in the trenches, like poison gas shells, caused bewilderment, dismay, and terrible deaths, as here recalled by British soldier Walter Clarke: You didn't know, they were only just shells. But what happened, these shells when they burst they'd drop all on the floor, liquid. And in the morning the mist, there's always a mist there every morning, that was coming into the air and you were breathing it all in. Nobody knew until one or two chaps started being sick and a lot of the fellows were laying about going blind and sores all over their eyes. And then they realised what it was. (Imperial War Museums) The seriously wounded were taken to military hospitals behind the lines, often staffed by volunteer nurses. Britisher Daisy Spickett was one such nurse, and here she explains why she joined the medical services: Remove Ads  I always had in mind that I wanted to nurse and as soon as I heard of any talk of forming Red Cross Hospitals I began to make enquiries. I heard also that there was a likelihood of the War Office wanting volunteers for military hospitals, and that was what I decided I wanted. It seemed to me the only hope of getting right into the middle of everything, getting abroad and doing whatever was going, and the idea of the Army attracted me   being in the Army. But it seemed to me the thing I wanted more than anything else and that was how I put my name down for military hospitals and got my posting in July 1915. (IWM) Christmas Truce, Illustrated London News Arthur Cadwgan Michael (Public Domain) Even amongst the horrors of the trenches, there were brief respites, the most remarkable being the Christmas truce of 1914, when several separate groups of soldiers along the Western Front met and exchanged gifts with the enemy. Elsewhere, messages of goodwill were simply shouted across no man's land, as here recorded by Lieutenant Edward Hulse:  there were wafted towards us from the trenches opposite the sounds of singing and merry-making, and occasionally the guttural tones of a German were to be heard shouting out lustily, 'A happy Christmas to you Englishmen!' (Lawson-Jones, 91) Trench life, endured for over four years for the lucky ones, came to be seen as an unchanging past, present, and future. Daily life in the trenches was recorded with a sort of disdainful nostalgia in popular songs such as this one written by the Australian soldier and poet Tom Skeyhill: I've a little wet home in the tench; Which the rain-storms continually drench; Blue sky overhead, Mud and clay for a bed, And a stone that we use for a bench. Bully beef and hard biscuits we chew; Shells crackle and scare, But no place can compare With my little wet home in the trench. Remove Ads  (Yorke, 46) WWI U-Boat & Crew Imperial War Musuems (CC BY-NC-SA) At Sea & in the Air WWI, of course, involved battles at sea and in the air. Alfred Fright, then still a teenager, recalls the greatest time of stress was waiting for any action to happen, as it inevitably would, sooner or later: Whilst you was waiting for it you was absolutely dead scared, dead scared. But once it started it was fine and you seemed to lose it all. But up until that point, as I say, you was dead scared. And I know I've stood on the bridge sometimes and cried with being scared. And also I've stood on the bridge   cos we used to have to do lookouts, you see, that was our job mostly, boys. Course the ship sways that much you go three times that much up at the top mast head you see. And I've stood up there with these glasses to my eyes, froze to death and crying. That's the sort of life it was in them days. (IWM) British officer S. Pawley remembers a battle when he served on board HMS Glasgow: We formed into battle line ahead with the Otranto on our port side at some distance and steamed north. It was not very long before smoke appeared on the horizon and we soon discovered this smoke came from two German heavy cruisers. And we were able to recognise Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. We were not long in closing on the enemy and soon the battle commenced. The Good Hope opened fire, a ranging shot, which fell short and then the battle became general. I was standing on the upper deck at the time; the sea was very rough under a leaden sky. At times the waves came clean overboard, came clean in over. We were hit in several places. One of our mess decks was flooded; the captain's cabin was wrecked; the signalman's arm was blown off in the foretop; holes were knocked in the coal bunkers and we were in a generally poor condition. (IWM) Aircraft became an important means of observation on the enemy and were used as bombers of strategic targets like supply dumps, bridges, and railway lines. Life in the air was glamorous but precarious, as here recalled by Royal Air Corps pilot Frederick Powell: Well I think, not only 40 Squadron, but every RFC Squadron, the centre of the squadron seemed to be in the bar. That may offend a lot of people in these days, but it is perfectly true. And when you think of these boys, with the tensions they lived through, through the day, and they came in, in the evening, and then asked about their best friend, 'Where's he? I miss old George'. 'Oh, he bought it this afternoon'. 'Oh, heavens'. Now the gloom would come into a mess; the morale would die and the reaction immediately was, 'Well, come on chaps, what're you going to have?' That was the sort of spirit that kept going. I still think that it played a magnificent part in keeping up the morale of our troops generally. (IWM) Woman Working in a WWI Ammunitions Factory George P. Lewis - Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Civilians in WWI As millions of men on all sides left their homes to fight, women were encouraged to replace the lost workers, particularly in vital industries like arms manufacturing and agriculture. Working in factories could be dangerous work, as here explained by one visitor to a German ammunition factory: The working conditions were like what they must have been under early capitalism. There was always 'something wrong'. Especially during the night shift. Never a night passed without one or more of the women collapsing at their machines from exhaustion, hunger, illness On many days in winter there would be no heating  (Strachan, 157) Civilian workers could become casualties of unexpected events, such as this explosion in a British weapons factory, recalled by Ethel M. Bilbrough: No news came that night, but next day we heard that it was the most awful explosion of its kind ever known, as a munitions factory in East London at Silverton had caught fire somehow (Ah! How?) and the fire spread until it reached all the explosives and then the whole place was hurled up into the air, and four streets were demolished, and the dead and the dying and the injured lay amongst the ruins, so that when a relief party arrived they hardly knew where to begin. Over 100 people were killed, and more than 400 injured and disabled. (Williams, 53). The Zeppelin bombing raids of WWI involved terrifying new machines that could attack anywhere in the dead of night. Civilians were now brought into the realm of war, no matter how distant the front lines were. David Kirkwood describes a Zeppelin attack on Edinburgh in April 1916: Suddenly a terrifying explosion occurred. Windows rattled, the ground quivered, pictures swung. We all gasped. I ran to the window and saw Vesuvius in eruption. I opened the window. A great flash greeted me from the castle and then, above the roaring, I heard the most dreadful screeching and shouting. (Williams, 41) WWI Zeppelin Leaving its Hangar Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Remembrance The First World War ended in 1918, but for many, the effects would last a lifetime. Injuries, shocking memories, personal losses, and the difficulties of reintegrating into civilian life haunted many. Shell shock, the physical and psychological effects of shell fire, was one such lingering effect of this new and terrible modern warfare, as explained by British soldier Bertram Steward: Love History?

The strain of continual bombardment   continual, not just one bomb and then a quarter of an hour and another one but continual bombardment all the time pounding and pounding away. Now I think that's what people didn't understand, they heard of people having shell shock but what happened was everybody had shell shock who went through that sort of thing. It manifested itself in different ways. One of my friends who went out there, when he came back after the war he was accustomed to shut himself up in his home or in his garden and he wouldn't come out at all and nobody could get him to. He finished up   he was a great athlete, a good boy at school   he finished up in a lunatic asylum and died only within a year or two of the finish of the war. (IWM) For those who survived, the act of remembrance each 11 November helped keep memories of the lost alive and recognise the great sacrifices made. Many poems were written for the fallen, but one of the most enduring is 'For the Fallen' by Laurence Binyon, who himself served as a medical orderly in France:",

        "title": "1918 Flu Pandemic: The Deadliest Pandemic in History",
        "content": "Fort Porter Flu Patient US War Department (Public Domain) The Spanish flu (so-named because the Spanish press openly reported on the outbreak while other World War I belligerents suppressed the news) broke out in March 1918 at Camp Funston, an army camp in Kansas, and struck young, healthy adults with greater ferocity than any other demographic group. Occurring in three waves (March-September 1918, September-December 1918, Spring-Summer 1919) and affecting nearly 500 million people worldwide, the death toll reached 50-100 million people. The conditions of the First World War, poor hygiene, overcrowded hospitals, poor eating habits, and the general lack of knowledge and treatment for viral infections all contributed to its lethality. Origin & Spread The pandemic started in Haskell County, Kansas. Known both for its cattle and hog herds, it was also the flyway for 17 migratory bird flocks. It seems most likely that the birds infected the hogs, and the hogs infected humans. In January-February 1918, Dr. Loring Miner reported the initial cases to the United States Public Health Service. As carriers of the virus, recruits reported for military duty at Camp Funston spread the disease to others in the camp during March-April 1918. Remove Ads  In younger & stronger people, the immune system responded more intensely, causing the build-up of fluids in the lungs. In this early, springtime phase of the outbreak, despite the hundreds of cases, there were very few deaths. In April, soldiers from Camp Funston began the journey to France, while others were dispatched to other US military installations. The bases, transport trains and ships, and frontlines were crowded and unsanitary, creating ideal conditions for the spread of an airborne, infectious disease. At the peak of the pandemic in October-November 1918, the mortality rate amongst soldiers on the Western Front reached 2%, while reports from India indicated a mortality rate of 10%. The third phase of the pandemic in 1919 was worsened by soldiers returning from the war through ports and military bases along the coast. These types of occurrences became familiar in port cities all around the world. Remove Ads  The Virus The virus that struck the world in 1918-1919 was the H1N1 influenza A variant. The virus originated in wild waterfowl, which transferred to hogs and pigs, then evolved to be transmitted to humans. Carried through the air from person to person, the virus overwhelmed the immune system by quickly replicating and infecting the upper respiratory system. In younger and stronger people, the immune system responded more intensely, causing severe inflammation and the build-up of fluids in the lungs. With the body weakened, the influenza infection most often led to secondary infections, especially pneumonia. Upon exposure to the influenza virus, symptoms occurred within 2-3 days. The patient suffered from fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, headaches, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting. Unique to the 1918 pandemic was the presence of a bluish tint to the skin (turning to purple near death), known as heliotrope cyanosis. This condition led to the lungs filling with fluid, causing the patient to suffocate. Death usually occurred within 3-5 days of the onset of the illness. The mortality rate was highest amongst the poor, soldiers, health workers, and people working in occupations characterized by crowded working conditions. Remove Ads  Contributing Conditions In major urban areas, crowded buildings and workplaces and the increasing number of people provided the virus with an abundance of hosts. The overcrowding was often accompanied by poor sanitation, poor water quality, insufficient food supply, and poor personal hygiene. The war zones suffered from extreme overcrowding of soldiers and support personnel at the various military installations. The close living conditions at the camps, the conditions of trench warfare on WWI's Western Front, and troop ships helped the spread of the disease. Furthermore, poor sanitation, lack of proper nourishment, soldiers suffering from a variety of war wounds, and the low to non-existent natural immunity of the soldiers who had no previous exposure to the flu affected the spread. It was no wonder that the most affected demographic during the pandemic, especially in the fall of 1918, was the 20-40-year-olds, particularly soldiers and sailors. The Interior of a Hospital Tent John Singer Sargent (CC BY-NC) Medical science would not make the distinction between bacteria and viruses until the 1930s, and it would not be until 2005 that the 1918 flu virus genome was finally mapped. Quinine treatments, especially in Italy, used in malaria hospital wards, seemed to show some effectiveness as few patients developed the flu, although opponents to the treatment argued the lack of scientific data to support quinine treatments, and malaria patients did get the flu. Aspirin was tried, but too often the doses administered were too high, leading to a build-up of fluids in the lungs and ultimately to death. Remove Ads  Another medicinal approach was mass vaccination. In England and the United States, doctors used a variety of vaccines, sometimes in combination with each other. The results of the vaccination campaigns were mixed. In 1918, the available vaccines were meant for bacterial infections, which caused some flu patients to become even sicker, while patients receiving a bacterial vaccine for pneumonia seemed to avoid death more successfully. Antibiotics were not available in 1918 to address secondary bacterial infections; the first antibiotic was only introduced after the discovery of penicillin in 1928. Public Health Measures Lacking any effective medical responses to the outbreak, communities relied on public gathering bans, including closures of private businesses, distancing, and masking. Closures included cinemas, theaters, and saloons/bars, however, it was not unusual for saloons to completely ignore orders. Public health officials filed lawsuits to compel businesses to comply, but court rulings were mixed. In some cases, courts ruled that the closure orders of health authorities did not apply, while other courts allowed the closures for a limited time only, as long as the epidemic was present in the community. As the pandemic dragged on, financial losses and job losses for businesses lessened their cooperation with officials. All the restrictions & limitations of conducting business & consumption were cast in patriotic terms. The pandemic did not produce an economic crisis, although late 1918 and early 1919 experienced a mild recession due to the scaling back of war production. The flu most affected leisure and entertainment workplaces, but in 1918-1919, people had little money to spend on those activities. The war had already taught consumers the need to restrict their spending, so the addition of a pandemic had a negligible effect on consumption. Most people labored in industries or agriculture, and illness among workers particularly hurt coal, steel, textile, and copper producers. In some cases, those industries were unable to fill government orders necessary for the war effort. All the restrictions and limitations of conducting business and consumption were cast in patriotic terms, not only to combat the pandemic but to free up scarce resources for the war effort. Remove Ads  Public establishments were no less affected, especially schools and churches. Again, the record was mixed in regards to both the cooperation of local authorities and the effectiveness in combating the outbreak. Some clergy openly defied closure orders, while some congregations simply met in other places rather than their usual church buildings. Precautions Against Influenza G. L. Angeny (Public Domain) Recognized by doctors and other medical personnel as the only form of protection from the virus, masking ordinances were enacted in many places. Since the pandemic broke out during the war, public health campaigns encouraged people to wear a mask as a sign of their patriotic duty, but resistance to mask-wearing was high. Public Responses Public responses varied from place to place, largely at the state or city level. There was recognition that many of the responses would be costly in social, economic, and legal terms. People engaged in behaviors rooted in the idea that cleanliness would be an effective preventative against the illness. Face masks, disinfection, and frequent hand- and food washing were encouraged. There were attempts to sanitize public buildings and public transportation. Products in the cleanliness campaign included lime milk, soda lye, and steaming bedding and laundry. Cleaning and ventilating homes often was also advised. People were recommended to avoid crowds both indoors and outdoors, as those were one of the greatest risk factors in the spread of the illness. In some places, bans were enacted, although many people ignored the measures, which led to an increased number of ill people and deaths. People were also recommended to stay out of public spaces, especially if they were showing symptoms of the flu or were infected. Isolating individuals and families at home helped to combat the spread. US Public Health Pamphlet for 1918 Flu US Public Health Services (Public Domain) Other well-meaning advice to combat the flu included eating simple, well-cooked meals, not spitting on floors, and avoiding strong air drafts. Of course, there were also recommendations that not only proved futile but were, in fact, quite silly, such as camphor ball necklaces, gargling, fumigation, carbolic spray, eating onions, and assembling in large gatherings in order to spread the germ so people might develop natural immunity to the disease. Consequences The pandemic ended by late spring in 1919. By that time, nearly one-third of the world's population had been infected, and roughly 3% of the world's population died (50-100 million people). Those who suffered the most were in the 25-40-year-old demographic. The influenza pandemic produced lasting consequences, apart from the number of people who fell ill or died, affecting public health measures, medicine   especially the emerging fields of epidemiology and virology   economics, art & literature, etc. No segment of human society was unaffected. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! The pandemic produced a whole host of medical innovations. Doctors learned of the effectiveness of blood transfusions from survivors to the sick, which ushered in the era of blood typing to make the transfusions compatible. As scientists developed a better understanding of the virus, and disease in general, by the late 1920s/early 1930s, researchers, using the new electron microscope, developed techniques to view the virus. Simultaneously, scientists began growing the virus in chicken eggs, which allowed them to discover two types of influenza: A and B. By the late 1930s, British and American scientists began testing a new vaccine to combat influenza. In 1944, the vaccine was used on soldiers, and the following year witnessed the mass vaccination of civilians. Those early flu vaccines contained both types of viruses, which would result in the multi-virus vaccine in use today. The tools used to create these early flu vaccines were also used to develop vaccines for other infectious diseases. The research would enhance medical science's understanding of genes, leading to the cracking of the genetic code of human DNA in 1944. Letter Carrier in 1918 Flu Pandemic US War Department (Public Domain) Writers and artists during and in the post-WWI era reflected the suffering and death caused by the pandemic. Virginia Woolf's character, Clarissa Dalloway, in Mrs. Dalloway (1925), suffered from a heart condition caused by the flu. Anne Porter, author of Pale Horse, Pale Rider (1939), not only contracted the flu but her soldier-lover, who nursed her back to health, would die from the flu, which he contracted from her. T.S. Eliot, in 1922, wrote Wasteland, which described society in the aftermath of war and disease as a wounded land, both wasted and decapacitated. Ahmed Ali's Twilight in Delhi (1940) highlights the 1918 flu pandemic as a symbol of the ending of the old order, the economic disruption, and loss of memory that humans have for earlier pandemics, making them unprepared for the 1918 outbreak. Artists depicted the themes of trauma and despair while themselves suffering from the illness. Gustav Klimt (1862-1918) died from a stroke caused by the flu. Edvard Munch (1863-1944) and John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) contracted the disease but survived. Sargent had been sent to the front by the British government to sketch the joint actions of British & American troops. In the post-war period, various art monuments reflected the theme of hopelessness and ways in which people tried to cope with war & disease. Dadaism, the Bauhaus, and the abstract art movement engaged in new forms, created more practical and useful objects, or departed from reality to go beyond literal ideas and emotions. Lastly, in the realm of social sciences, the 1918 pandemic undermined the eugenic & social Darwinism movements. The disease struck everyone regardless of class, status, income, age, etc. The pandemic undermined the idea that there existed some group of 'superior' people in society. The flu undercut the notion that people were somehow responsible for catching diseases, either due to some character flaw or physical defect. No better example of this was the illness that struck the American president, Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), who became ill while attending the Paris Peace Conference to sign the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Wilson suffered from a fever, coughing fits, diarrhea, weakness, and confusion. Many writers have assumed that Wilson suffered a stroke while in Paris (a condition that struck him back in the United States while he tried to convince the US Congress and the American people to support the League of Nations), but in fact, Wilson caught the flu, shown by the symptoms he suffered from. The influenza pandemic swept the world, showing no favoritism toward any individuals, region, or nation, and became the deadliest pandemic of the 20th century.",

        "content": "Smasher of Napoleon's invasion dream, veteran of three major wars, and scene of the death of the Royal Navy's greatest hero, HMS Victory is one of Britain's most famous warships. Curiously, and despite being on permanent display as a tourist attraction, Victory remains to this day a fully commissioned naval vessel. This is her story. A First-Rate Warship HMS Victory was constructed from 1759 at Chatham Dockyards in Kent to a design by Sir Thomas Slade. Built of solid oak and elm, the ship required the sacrifice of an incredible 2,500 mature trees. Completed in May 1765, the three-masted ship was over 227 ft (69 m) long and displaced 3,500 long tons. It was the largest ship yet built for the navy, and she was fast. In the right conditions, Victory could cut through the water with remarkable speed for her size thanks to 36 sails and an innovative hull design. Remove Ads  HMS Victory by Pocock Nicholas Pocock (Public Domain) Victory was far from being a positive name for most of the sailors first assigned to her. This was because the last naval ship named Victory had sunk in 1744, with all hands drowned. This new Victory, actually the seventh British naval ship to carry that name, had a long wait to see active duty: 13 years, in fact. The first-rate warship carried a crew of over 800 and positively bristled with more than 100 guns set along three cramped decks. Victory was a major weapon for the British in the 1770s during the American Revolutionary War. The ship was then refitted and made the flagship of Vice-Admiral Lord Hood, who sailed her around the Mediterranean in the early 1790s during the French Revolutionary Wars. Victory sported a new hull covering of almost 4,000 copper plates. Victory's fortunes then went into decline as her condition deteriorated. Serving as a hospital ship in 1797, Victory was slated to see out her days as a prison hulk, the ultimate fall from grace. The venerable old warship then received a last-minute reprieve. After the loss of HMS Impregnable in 1799, and with war looming against the old enemy, France, the Admiralty was obliged to bring Victory back into service. Remove Ads  A Major Refit Extensively refitted, Victory sported a new hull covering of almost 4,000 copper plates and a whole new complement of lighter, more accurate, and faster-loading cannons. Most striking of all, the ship was painted a distinctive dark grey with yellow stripes. Victory was once again ready for war and her finest hour. The famed artist John Constable selected Victory as the subject of one of his paintings, describing the ship as \"the flower of the flock.\" Stern View, HMS Victory Library of Congress (Public Domain) From 1803, Britain and Napoleon's France were at war. The Napoleonic Wars involved a vast array of European nations, but it was a crucial naval battle in October 1805 that scuppered Napoleon's planned invasion of Britain and established the Royal Navy as the world's foremost naval fleet. This battle was Trafalgar. Remove Ads  The Battle of Trafalgar Victory was selected as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson, England's finest commander of the period and already a national hero. In the two-year build-up to the great Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson never left Victory once, sleeping each night in his bed of preference, a suspended cot positioned between two giant cannons. The British fleet met the slightly larger French and Spanish fleets off Cape Trafalgar (on the southern coast of Spain). It was from Victory that Nelson issued his immortal signal: \"England expects that every man will do his duty.\" The Royal Navy won the battle thanks to Nelson's innovative tactics, where, risking the full force of enemy fire as the respective fleets closed in, he smashed through the centre of the enemy's more traditional formation of two lines of ships. Another factor in the Royal Navy's favour was the ability of its experienced gunners to fire twice as fast as those of the enemy. Horatio Nelson Lemuel Francis Abbott (Public Domain) Victory's crew at Trafalgar included Britons, Indians, Africans, Americans, and even three Frenchmen. There was one woman, too, a Minorcan disguised as a man. The youngest crew member was not yet 12, and the eldest was well into his sixties. Some men were volunteers, others were conscripts, and some were convicts. All had one goal: survive the battle. Remove Ads  The venerable old warship survived Trafalgar but was badly battered. Victory was certainly no bystander to the battle and knocked out no less a ship than the French Admirals' flagship Bucentaure. With 104 guns, Victory was a formidable foe. Firing cannons accurately on a rolling sea was far from easy and required teamwork. A 32-pounder   of which Victory boasted 30   weighed three tons and needed a crew of 12 to 15 men to operate. Victory also had two massive 68-pounders on her decks; one of these had caused carnage when it fired a barrel of 500 musket balls right through the Bucentaure's stern windows. The British ship did not escape unscathed; her huge wheel was shattered by cannon fire, and it took a team of 40 men to rig an alternative steering mechanism in the heat of battle. Incredibly, no British ships were lost in the battle, but there was a heavy price to pay for victory. In the chaos of sail, smoke, and smashed timbers, a sniper on the French warship Redoubtable had fatally hit Nelson while he prowled Victory's quarterdeck. At least the stricken commander lived long enough to learn of his great victory. The venerable old warship survived Trafalgar but was badly battered, both in the battle itself and in the storm which immediately followed it. Victory, obliged to stop at Gibraltar for vital repairs, carried Nelson home preserved in a barrel of brandy. Aerial View, HMS Victory Geoff Parselle - MOD (Open Government License) Later Career Victory saw yet more active service as the Napoleonic Wars dragged on, particularly in the Baltic, and then operated as a troop ship from 1810. By the 1820s, the great ship was going nowhere and, dismasted and moored at Portsmouth, served as a stationary flagship of the naval command. Placed in dry dock in 1922 and then restored to its former glory, Victory was opened to public visits in 1928 in a ceremony presided over by King George V. The ship, 20% of which remains original, can still be toured today at Portsmouth's Historic Dock Yard. Victory's crucial role in Britain's defence is not forgotten; all naval vessels which pass her in Portsmouth fire a gun salute in her honour.",

        "title": "Battle of Ashdown: The First Major Defeat of the Great Heathen Army",
        "content": "The Battle of Ashdown, fought on 8th January 871 in southern England, saw the Kingdom of Wessex defeat the Great Heathen (Viking) Army. This was the first major defeat of the Viking army, which had arrived in England in 865 and had conquered several Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. While the conflict between the Wessex and the Vikings continued for several months into 871 and beyond, Ashdown demonstrated that the Viking army could be defeated, giving the English hope for future battles. Alfred the Great Statue, Shaftesbury Abbey Seth Whales (CC BY-SA) Wessex at the time was ruled by King Aethelred (reign 865-871), but his younger brother   and soon-to-be successor   Alfred the Great (reign 871-899), played a decisive role in the victory at Ashdown, proving himself a capable military commander and ensuring the West Saxon nobles backed his succession later in 871. Alfred spent most of his reign locked in a struggle with the Vikings, but secured his kingdom through victories at the Battles of Edington in 878 and the Battle of Buttington in 893. Remove Ads  Our knowledge of Ashdown relies heavily on The Life of King Alfred, a contemporary biography of the king written by his advisor and tutor, Bishop Asser. It presents a pro-Alfredian version of Ashdown, yet it nevertheless provides the most detailed contemporary account of a battle in 9th-century Britain, offering invaluable insights into Anglo-Saxon warfare. Vikings Raids England in the 8th century was divided into several kingdoms: East Anglia, Mercia (Midlands), Northumbria (northern England), and Wessex (southwest England). The rulers of these kingdoms competed for wealth, land and prestige, often fighting wars and occasionally allying with one another. It was this world of Anglo-Saxon game of Thrones that the Vikings entered into toward the end of the century. Initially, they began as small groups of Scandinavian pirates, sailing south in the hope of wealth and plunder. They first attacked Wessex in 789 and then Northumbria in 793, where they notoriously raided the prestigious monastery of Lindisfarne. With their great stores of wealth and limited defences, coastal monasteries and trading ports quickly became favoured targets for Viking raids in Britain. Remove Ads  The Vikings would not long remain content with mere plunder; they soon wanted to conquer & settle in England, too. Around the same time, the Kingdom of Wessex was growing in power, and upon conquering Mercia-ruled Kent in 829, it became the most dominant of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. While its early 9th-century kings, Egbert (reign 802-839) and Aethelwulf (reign 839-858), were effective military leaders and enjoyed several victories against the Vikings, these raids were becoming increasingly difficult to halt. Even their wealthiest towns soon became valid targets, and around the middle of the 9th century, Canterbury, London, Southampton and Winchester were looted by the Vikings. Using hit-and-run tactics, the Vikings could sail toward and plunder a coastal target, then return to their ships, before the English   who did not have standing armies   could summon numbers large enough to fight the raiders. They would, however, not long remain content with mere plunder; they soon wanted to conquer and settle in England, too. Remove Ads  The Great Army In 865, an alliance of sea-kings and raiders   known by contemporaries as \"the Great Army\"   gathered in the North Sea. According to the Norse sagas, its leaders, Ivar, Halfdan, and Ubbe, were brothers seeking revenge for their father, who had been killed by an English king. They were remembered by the English simply as \"valiant but cruel men.\" East Anglia   the smallest of the English kingdoms   was their first target. However, King Edmund of East Anglia (reign 855-869) offered tribute to the Norsemen in exchange for a peace treaty. The invaders were provided with horses, silver, food supplies and were allowed to winter in East Anglia. Great Viking Army in England, 865-878 CE Hel-hama (CC BY-SA) The following year, their new equestrian companions were put to use as they rode into Northumbria, conquering York, its wealthy capital. Two Northumbria kings led attacks to reclaim the town, but along with several northern ealdormen (earls), they were defeated and died at York. One shrewd Northumbrian ealdorman, Egbert, however, had stayed clear of battle and aligned himself with the invaders. In exchange, he was appointed to rule over the northern regions of Northumbria (historically known as Bernicia) on their behalf. Meanwhile, the Viking took direct control of York and its surrounding lands. In 868, they turned south, capturing Nottingham in northwest Mercia and fortifying themselves within. The Mercian ruler, King Burgred (reign 852-874), had long been an ally of the West Saxons and thus requested help from King Aethelred of Wessex. Together, they placed Nottingham under siege, but for the Anglo-Saxon commander, fortress warfare was an uncommon experience. They were unable to attack Nottingham's walls directly, nor could they maintain their armies long enough to starve Ivar into submission. Therefore, the Vikings accepted tribute payment from Burgred, delivered in gold and silver, in exchange for peace. Each payment, no doubt, emptied the coffers of its payees and attracted new recruits from Scandinavia, who heard tales of the prosperity enjoyed by their kinsmen and friends in England. Remove Ads  The following year, the Vikings returned to East Anglia, capturing Thetford, but no amount of tribute would save Edmund this time. His army was defeated, before he was tracked down and brought before Ivar. Edmund was offered to be the Vikings' vassal, like Egbert of Northumbria, and upon his refusal, he was tied to a tree before being stabbed with spears and beheaded. Burgred of Mercia might now have understood the hollowness and temporary nature of a peace treaty with the Vikings. The Death of St Edmund Abbo of Fleury (Public Domain) 871: A Year of Battles Ivar was seemingly content with his work so far. Establishing dominance of England's east coast and the great trading centre of York, he next took his followers north to fight the Strathclyde Britons. This left Halfdan as the senior leader of the army in East Anglia. Known by the West Saxons as \"the tyrant,\" Halfdan was a Danish ruler who left behind his kingdom to carve out a new one amongst the British Isles (Aethelweard, 41). With Northumbria crushed, Mercia taxed and King Edmund martyred, Halfdan decided Wessex would be next. In December 870, he marched southwest from East Anglia, taking Reading on Wessex's northern border. The town was ideally situated as an invasion headquarters. Sitting on the Thames, it allowed new soldiers and supplies to flow in and provided an easy escape route if things went wrong. With the town surrounded on two sides by the Thames and the River Kennet, Halfdan built ramparts around the rest of Reading, making it an impregnable fortress. Remove Ads  \"Ashdown\" is often a term used to describe the whole of the northern Berkshire Downs, rather than a specific place. Upon arrival, a raiding party was sent out to the Berkshire countryside in search of plunder, slaves and supplies. All the while, a local nobleman and veteran of Viking warfare, Ealdorman Aethelwulf of Berkshire, was rallying his troops. His army fell upon the raiders at Englefield (5 miles or 8 km west of Reading), cutting them down from their horses and slaying their leader. A minor battle it might have been, but the first victory had gone to Wessex. To the south, more support awaited as King Aethelred was raising a large army to help Ealdorman Aethelwulf. As Aethelred and Aethelwulf came to the fortress, they slaughtered several unprepared Viking soldiers found outside its walls. Yet, taking the fortress was altogether a different task. The two leaders, Aethelred and Halfdan, had already met previously, during the siege of Nottingham in 868, when the Vikings were content to play the waiting game, before being paid to leave. Halfdan, however, would not repeat this strategy. He surprised his opponent and immediately confronted the West Saxons. As Asser explains: Like wolves, they burst out of all the gates and joined battle with all their might. Both sides fought there for a long time, and fought fiercely, but alas, the Christians eventually turned their backs, and the Vikings won the victory and were masters of the battlefield. (Keynes and Lapidge, 78) Amongst the dead outside Reading was Wessex's most celebrated war chief, Ealdorman Aethelwulf, a great blow to the king's campaign. Aethelred's army retreated westward, perhaps linking up with fresh soldiers arriving from Wiltshire and Somerset. Halfdan now felt he had the perfect opportunity to finish off Wessex for good. His experience in East Anglia and Northumbria taught him that the capture of a key town, followed by military victory and the king's death, led to the kingdom's surrender. So, he followed Aethelred west, hoping to inflict a second and fatal defeat upon him. Battle of Ashdown On 8th January 871, on a cold winter morning, the armies of Aethelred and Halfdan caught sight of one another amongst the northern Berkshire hills. However, where they stood is uncertain. \"Ashdown\" is often a term used to describe the whole of the northern Berkshire Downs, rather than a specific place. Yet most scholars suggest the battle likely took place among the hills west of the village of Moulsford, on the Oxfordshire-Berkshire border. We also know nothing of either army's size. While the West Saxons would have lost many outside the gates of Reading, fresh recruits from the west after the battle likely brought them back to a size similar to the Viking army, which had left behind a garrison to guard Reading. The army of Wessex was formed from a core of professional warriors serving in the household of the king and ealdormen, along with those of lesser status who owed military service to and were led by local landowning warriors (thegns). The soldiers on both sides were mostly armed with shields and spears, with axes more prevalent among the Vikings, and the elite West Saxon warriors bearing swords an expensive, rare weapon often passed down through generations.

As the two sides looked across from one another, Halfdan gave his first order. His army was to be divided into two, half led by him and his ally, King Bagsec, and the other half by several earls. As they spread out across the upper grounds of the Berkshire hills, Halfdan gave a second order, and his army duly formed a \"shield wall\"   a long front line of soldiers locking their shields together to guard against an incoming attack. Seeing this, Aethelred followed suit, splitting his army into two shield walls, with himself commanding one to oppose Halfdan and Bagsec, and his younger brother, Prince Alfred, commanding the other to face the Viking earls. However, before any fighting could begin, Aethelred returned to his tent for a pre-battle mass, praying for divine help. Some form of prayers or mass was not unusual before battle. The English were, after all, convinced that the Vikings had been sent to punish them for their sins. Holding himself responsible for the souls of his subjects, Aethelred was fighting both a physical and a spiritual war. Halfdan, however, had no interest in respecting Christian pre-battle rituals. He seized this moment of vulnerability to strike first. Abandoning the high ground, he and the Viking earls marched on Alfred, hoping to crush his army with their superior numbers. When Aethelred was informed, he declared he \"would not leave that place [the tent] alive before the priest had finished mass and that he would not forsake divine service for that of men\" (Keynes and Lapidge 79). Alfred would now have to take on both Halfdan and the Viking earls alone. \"With loud shouting from all,\" and Alfred \"acting courageously, like a wild boar,\" as Asser tells us, he strode forth to meet the Vikings (Keynes and Lapidge, 79). Artist's Impression of Alfred the Great The Creative Assembly (Copyright) The clash between the two armies sounded with a mighty \"thud\" as the walls of wooden shields smashed together. A shield wall versus shield wall clash often sank into a slow-moving shoving match. With little innovative strategy or creativity, in this battle of strength, power and determination, each side would seek to push the other back and break through their wall. Meanwhile, frontline warriors poked, jabbed, prodded and stabbed their spears at gaps in the wall, hoping to deliver lethal blows to their opposite number. Such a slow-moving contest suited Alfred; being vastly outnumbered, he could only hope to hold off the Vikings long enough for Aethelred to come to his rescue. Remove Ads  Eventually, Aethelred arrived, leading his troops in an ambush of the Vikings. Some scholars have even suggested that his delayed entry was a tactical move, rather than a religious one. Perhaps striking the Vikings' flank or rear, he relieved pressure on his brother and gained the upper hand over the invaders. The fight continued for several more hours, yet as the waning Viking army was attacked on two fronts, their shield wall crumbled and collapsed. The West Saxons surged through the breaches, hewing down their foes in great numbers. A 10th-century chronicler, Ealdorman Aethelweard, remarked, \"neither before nor after has such a slaughter been heard of.\" Asser recorded: Bagseg was killed, and Earl Sidroc the Old, Earl Sidroc the Younger, Earl Osbem, Earl Fraena, and Earl Harold . ... the entire Viking army was put to flight, right on till nightfall and into the following day, until such time as they reached the stronghold [Reading] from which they had come. The Christians followed them till nightfall, cutting them down on all sides. (Keynes and Lapidge, 80) Aftermath Halfdan's plans of a quick victory had been shattered. Just over a week into the war, a large chunk of his army and several of his leading allies had died. Wessex was not, after all, so weak as Northumbria or East Anglia. However, given his experience at Reading just a few days before, Aethelred would not assault the town again. It appeared that the conflict would be a stalemate. The Vikings were unable to conquer Wessex, and the West Saxons were unable to expel the Vikings. However, with the death of several allied Viking leaders   and potential rivals for command   Halfdan now commanded greater authority over the army. Perhaps to secure his complete leadership over this admittedly smaller force and replenish supplies, only two weeks after Ashdown, he led another raid into Wessex. His target was Basing, 15 miles (24 km) south of Reading. Outside the town, he was once again met by King Aethelred's army, but this time he defeated the West Saxons and took control of Basing. The conflict now reached an informal ceasefire, with two months of peace. The campaign was reignited in March, when the Vikings raided deep into Hampshire, where they defeated Aethelred at the Battle of Merton. Following the battle, a second Viking fleet (known as \"the great summer army\") sailed from the continent to Reading to assist Halfdan. Worse, during the battle at Merton, Aethelred had been fatally wounded. He only lived a few more weeks before dying in April 871. In accordance with arrangements made earlier that year, Alfred succeeded to the throne, ahead of his brother's infant sons, Aethelwold and Aethelhelm, who were not yet old enough to rule. Although he frequently suffered from a mysterious and severe illness, Alfred was 22 years old and had already proven his bravery during the battles at Reading, Ashdown, Basing and Merton. Swanborough Tump Memorial, Wiltshire Bikeboy (CC BY-SA) However, his reign began with a series of military disasters. While he was overseeing his brother's funeral and burial at Wimborne Minster, the army of Berkshire was defeated by the great summer army at Reading. Nearer to home, in May 871, Alfred himself was defeated in battle by Halfdan near Wilton, Wiltshire. This had dashed any hope Alfred had of a military solution. The only way the Vikings would now leave was by paying them. The payment (or \"danegeld\") would no doubt empty his coffers and make him unpopular with his new and now heavily taxed subjects. Remove Ads  While Halfdan had enjoyed a string of victories, he had not won a decisive enough victory to discredit support for Alfred. Nor had he intended to lead such a long campaign; thus, as his army grew smaller with each battle and supplies became ever more meagre, he accepted being paid to leave Wessex, retreating to London in the autumn of 871. As the year ended, Alfred could take solace in the fact that he kept his crown and kingdom, a fate better than Edmund of East Anglia or the Northumbrian kings. Legacy 871 had been a year of great significance for the Viking invasion. Significant death tolls were suffered by both sides, including several of the leaders involved. Wessex had, however, shown it was capable of defeating the Great Heathen Army in battle, something that no other kingdom had achieved so far. The war between the English and the Vikings would continue. Halfdan attacked Mercia in 874, forcing King Burgred into exile on the continent. He would subsequently shift his focus to Northumbria and Ireland, leaving the leader of the great summer army, Guthrum, to take up the fight against Alfred in the south. When Guthrum invaded Wessex in 878, he chased Alfred into the Somerset marshes, almost conquering the entire kingdom. Only several months later, when Alfred regathered the West Saxons, was he able to raise a large enough army to defeat Guthrum at the Battle of Edington. Alfred the Great Statue, Winchester Odejea (CC BY-NC-SA) Guthrum and Alfred soon agreed to a more lasting peace treaty, with the Viking leader converting to Christianity and southern England being divided between them, as the declining Mercian kingdom was carved into an English west and a Norse east. As Christian brothers, they endeavoured to uphold an imperfect peace between both sides until Guthrum died in 890. However, the next generation would continue the fight for supremacy, with Alfred's heirs   Edward the Elder (his son) and Aethelstan (his grandson)   extending West Saxon control over the rest of England.",

        "title": "Lend-Lease: The WWII US Aid Programme for Allies",
        "content": "Lend-Lease Machine Guns Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Lend-Lease (sometimes called Lease-Lend) was a programme of financial and material aid given by the United States to its allies during the Second World War (1939-45). Food, weapons, ammunition, and agricultural equipment were amongst the goods which crossed the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The value of Lend-Lease goods has been estimated at around $50 billion. Payment was expected from the recipient states, although there was flexibility on how much, in what form, and when this was to be given. Lend-Lease was a massive operation, which ensured the US minimised its own military casualties while still using its tremendous economic power to drive the Allied cause. The programme became one of the great logistical achievements of the war effort, immeasurably helping the Allies win WWII. Helping the Allies At the outset of the Second World War, the United States, wary of becoming embroiled in a conflict on another continent, remained officially neutral and so could not directly intervene militarily. Giving material aid to participants in a war had been prohibited by the mid-1930s Neutrality Acts. Even loans were restricted by the Johnson Debt-Default Act, which excluded those nations that had not paid back the money lent during the First World War (1914-18). This was a heavy restriction because the only country which had paid off all of its debts to the US was Finland. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was determined to break down the traditional US foreign policy of isolationism any way he could within the law, and so he summoned Congress to repeal parts of the legislation blocking aid for the Allies. First, France and Britain were permitted to purchase arms (provided they paid cash and transported the arms themselves), and then another Congressional decision allowed US merchant ships to enter war zones and carry arms and ammunition as cargo. There was now a way to legally send much-needed assistance to Europe and elsewhere, yet for the United States to remain neutral. Remove Ads  In total, over 38 countries received aid from the USA during the war. Roosevelt, faced with direct appeals for aid from figures like British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was even willing to bend the law a little. For example, the US President ensured British warships were repaired in US ports, and he sent warplanes to the USA's Canadian border, which allowed the Canadians to literally haul the planes into their own territory and then send them on to Europe. Another case involved an exchange of US destroyer warships for bases. Under this deal, the US promised to provide Britain with 50 destroyers (they received only 9 by the end of 1940), and in return, it acquired 99-year leases for several naval bases in the West Indies, Bermuda, Newfoundland, and British Guiana. Battle of the Atlantic, 1943 Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Roosevelt finally gained more freedom of action following the widespread outrage at the German U-boat attack on the US destroyer Kearny in October 1941 and the consequent repeal of many more restrictive neutrality laws. The US then went into full swing in its efforts to give aid to those defending freedom. Remove Ads  The Lend-Lease programme was designed, then, to give material and financial aid to those Allied nations which were fighting the three common enemies of the free world: Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan. As the name suggests, the programme did not give goods for free; recipients were expected to repay the costs, but there was flexibility in terms of both the amount and timing of the repayments. Beneficiaries of the Lend-Lease programme included Great Britain, the USSR, China, South Africa, Egypt, Australia, and New Zealand. In total, over 38 countries received aid from the USA during the war. The Issue of Payment As noted above, the US preferred cash for the goods sent via Lend-Lease. This soon became problematic since countries like Britain, not only suffering from the war but also from the consequent collapse in world trade, were running very low on cash reserves. With France's surrender in June 1940, Britain was left alone in Europe to face an aggressively rampant Germany and Italy. Britain could call on assistance from colonies like India and Australia, but the fact was that the size of the British Empire meant Britain was struggling both militarily and financially to protect its assets in South Asia, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. On top of that, Adolf Hitler seemed determined to launch a German invasion of the British Isles. Remove Ads  Many in the US could not believe the government that presided over the vast British Empire was strapped for cash, but that was the reality, and Churchill even offered to show the nation's accounting books to Roosevelt to prove it. The British ambassador to the US starkly stated: \"Britain's broke\" (Dear, 531). There was a gradual realisation amongst many Americans that Britain was, in effect, fighting a war so that the US could remain on the sidelines militarily. An analogy came into common circulation of the moral and practical benefits of loaning one's fire hose to a neighbour when their house was on fire. If Britain collapsed under the pressure, then there would be nothing to stop the authoritarian aggressors of WWII from turning their sights on North America and setting houses ablaze there, too. On the other hand, giving aid carried risks. US material aid to Britain was regarded by the aggressor nations as no different from being fully involved in the war. It did seem that continuing and even increasing aid would eventually lead to the US becoming militarily embroiled in WWII. Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1944 Leon Perskie (CC BY) Roosevelt did hold out hope that if enough aid were given, then US troops would not be needed in the conflict and US military casualties would be avoided. From December 1940, this attitude and that of the fire analogy meant Roosevelt was prepared to give material to the USA's democratic allies and not insist on particular conditions or exact figures of repayment. To continue the fire hose analogy, Roosevelt argued to Congress that if one's neighbour did manage to put out their fire but damaged the hose in the process, then compensation could be made not in terms of the precise cost of the hose but by an informal agreement that its value would be repaid in kind. A bill was passed by Congress in March 1941, and the US became the 'Arsenal of Democracy' as Roosevelt put it. Repayment terms were to be agreed according to what \"the President deems satisfactory\" (the wording of the legislation, quoted in Dear, 531), judging on a case-by-case basis. It should also be noted that many countries sent raw materials to the US, which were used to produce the manufactured goods they most needed. The US industries providing Lend-Lease goods positively boomed. Increasingly, as the war went on, payment was expected not in cash or goods but in concessions favourable to long-term US foreign policy and trade, such as opening up of closed markets and removing any restrictions previously applied to the US. There also remained some sticky issues, such as those who opposed giving aid to the communist USSR (which had become Adolf Hitler's principal enemy from the summer of 1941) and whether or not the US Navy should provide warships to defend the convoys carrying material aid to Europe and elsewhere. Remove Ads  Types of Materials Sent The Lend-Lease materials sent by ship and air were very varied indeed, ranging from eggs to tanks. Although all payment for goods required the approval of Congress, the only restriction made by President Roosevelt on what could be included in the Lend-Lease programme was that the goods were needed \"in the interest of national defence\" (legislation text, quoted in Dear, 531). There were, otherwise, no legal restrictions on what could be sent to Allied nations. From August 1941, the general production and supervision of goods was the responsibility of a new organisation, the Office of Lend-Lease Administration (OLLA). Lend-Lease Agricultural Equipment Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) A major component was food for Britain, where people endured a strict system of rationing. Britain not only received US-produced food like cheese and meat but also agricultural equipment, which could improve homegrown production rates on British farms. Another major success was the delivery of tens of thousands of trucks to the USSR's Red Army, effectively making this a truly mobile force for the first time. US-built tanks helped boost the Allied cause in the North Africa Campaign. Small- and large-calibre munitions were vital to keep guns firing in all theatres of the war. Engines and spare parts ensured machines of war of all kinds could continue to operate. The US industries providing Lend-Lease goods positively boomed. US war production was ramped up, and the huge logistical network required to transport the goods was quickly and efficiently developed. Most goods were delivered to Britain by merchant ships operating in convoys for greater safety. Goods not destined for Britain were then shipped on to places like Murmansk and the Persian Gulf. Lend-Lease production also had to face competition from the demands of the US military once the United States became fully involved in the war following the attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941. There was certainly a shortage of merchant ships in 1942, but production of these caught up with demand by 1943. Ultimately, Lend-Lease bases were established around the world from Australia to Chile to Morocco to China. Many such bases benefited from an expansion of local rail and road networks. Some aircraft were flown to their destination, often by civilian pilots, including women. Remove Ads  The Lend-Lease programme was hugely successful in getting material to where it was most needed. The total cost of goods sent can only be estimated because of the sheer scale of the project, but The Oxford Companion to World War II states, \"between $42 and $50 billion of aid-food, military goods, oil, industrial production, and services went to America's wartime allies\" (532). Britain received more than anyone else, around half of those goods, while the USSR received around one-fifth. Lend-Lease Cheese Shipment Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The End of Lend-Lease The Lend-Lease programme continued to split US politics as the war went on. A Senate decision to continue the programme in the spring of 1945 only won against those senators who wished to end it by a single vote. There were claims (sometimes true) that states were welcoming goods under Lend-Lease but then exporting them elsewhere for profit. Some in the United States called for a reduction of aid to Britain, the argument being that state was surely capable now of standing alone and was only using US aid to strengthen its own future position in the post-war world. This was not true since, having been forced to give up assets to the US, Britain was particularly affected by the long-term repercussions of Lend-Lease, as the historian S. Ambrose explains: The Americans insisted that the British sell their overseas assets; this meant that at the end of the war the income that the British counted on and depended on for so long from her overseas investments was no longer there. They had been sold at American insistence The Americans then moved into the areas that had previously been British colonies, whether simple or economic colonies. So Britain was in a much weaker position at the end of the war than she had been at the beginning and was not in a position to recover. (Holmes, 129) There had been (albeit vague) promises back in 1944 that Lend-Lease would continue after the war to help the much-needed and extremely costly task of rebuilding war-ravaged countries. Nevertheless, President Harry S. Truman, who took office in April 1945, immediately cancelled Lend-Lease following the Japanese surrender in August. Many governments felt let down by this decision, and Truman later admitted the programme should have continued for longer, although some states did receive substantial long-term loans, such as the $650 million lent to France in 1945. The question of repayments remained contentious. The USSR, for example, baulked at US demands to pay back an outstanding $2.6 billion. In fact, an agreement on the repayment terms was not reached until 1990. Lend-Lease did leave a more meaningful legacy in the longer term. The United States and other nations came to regard aid-giving as a necessary and mutually beneficial branch of foreign policy, an attitude that continues to hold favour today with many governments around the world.",

        "title": "Chinampas: Mexico's Human-Made Agricultural Islands",
        "content": "Modern Chinampa Farming Emmanuel Eslava (CC BY-SA) Chinampas are human-made islands built in shallow lakebeds that have fed the people of Mesoamerica and shaped local ecosystems for over a thousand years. Sometimes referred to as 'floating gardens,' these agricultural feats of engineering survive as a testament to the ingenuity of the Aztec civilization and their lake-dwelling predecessors, particularly the ancient peoples of Xochimilco, where chinampas are still in use today. Building a Chinampa With the posts in place to establish the structure of the artificial island, laborers wove reeds, vines, & branches between them to create the enclosure. The word chinampa derives from the Nahuatl term chinamitl, meaning \"a fence made of plants\" or that which could be enclosed within a fence of plants. The labor-intensive process of building a chinampa began with locating a firm floor in the shallow area of a lake. There, laborers would drive wooden posts into the lake bottom. The designated area for the construction was usually rectangular, with lengths varying from 8 to 100 meters and widths ranging between 2 and 25 meters. Along with the posts, laborers planted willow trees, such as Mexico's native bonpland willows (Salix bonplandiana), in the corners or along the perimeter, where the roots of the trees would give structure to the nascent chinampa. The Florentine Codex depicts a willow tree growing out of blue waves; its simple, lance-shaped leaves that alternate along the stem are characteristic of the water-loving Salix genus. Remove Ads  With the posts in place to establish the structure of the artificial island, laborers wove reeds, vines, and branches between them to create the enclosure from which the chinampa derives its name. Once the fence of plants was completed, laborers began the arduous task of filling the enclosure with many layers of soil, at least some of which would have been scraped from the bottom of the lake itself, thus fortifying the fence with mud and further plant material. Once the chinamitl was stable and the raised mud and soil reached a height of 50 cm above the surface of the water, the top layer of soil was left to dry for several weeks before the land was used for planting. Huexotl Willow Tree Unknown Artist (CC BY-NC-ND) To control floodwaters and promote moisture content in the soil, laborers constructed sophisticated drainage systems including dams, sluice gates, ditches, dikes, and canals. Flowing between chinampa fields, the canals served as waterways and allowed those who worked the land to transport supplies, crops, and fertilizer directly to and from the artificial fields in the lake shallows. Capillary action drew water into the layers of soil in the chinampa, allowing adjacent canals to serve as reservoirs for an integrated subirrigation system that met the water needs of the crops and created a microenvironment that protected them from frost. In addition to the aquatic infrastructure required to sustain the chinampas, water reservoirs and fish weirs   fences placed in flowing water to direct the motion of fish   could also be constructed to set aside water for different tasks and to expedite fishing. Remove Ads  Fertilization & Maintenance In order to ensure the ongoing fertility of these human-made agricultural islands, farmers, known as chinamperos, employed a number of fertilization methods. One of these methods involved transferring mud, soil, sediment, and vegetation from the bottom of the canals to the top layer of the artificial fields. This process helped to maintain the canals while also renewing the topsoil of the chinampas for better planting. The soil from the canals contained a high build-up of organic material from decomposing plant matter, animal waste, and other waterborne debris, which facilitated water retention and kept crops from losing too much moisture during the dry season. This allowed for year-round cultivation, made efficient through the use of seedbeds to prepare new crops for planting even while others were being harvested. Adding fresh topsoil from the canals also helped to aerate the chinampas and promoted long-term fertility and high productivity. Other methods of fertilization included applying compost (including food waste, ash, charcoal, and excrement) and other organic materials. Using crop residue as mulch also helped to suppress the growth of weeds. With careful maintenance, chinampas in the time of the Aztecs could host a huge array of crops and flowers. Today's chinamperos, keeping alive the agricultural tradition, cultivate crops including maize, legumes (bush beans and fava beans), amaranth, tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, radish, seepweed, purslane, and many more. While the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica would not have had access to nearly as many domesticated animals, most of which are not native to the Americas, modern chinamperos often keep animals like chickens, cattle, swine, and sheep, feeding them on excess produce and adding their manure to the fertilization process. Remove Ads  Canals of Xochimilco Luis Bartolom  Marcos (CC BY-SA) Benefits of Chinampa Design for Agriculture & Ecosystem After hundreds of years, the chinampas still make it possible to grow crops in a lacustrine environment and promote the health of the local ecosystem. Within the chinampas themselves, the native willows planted at the perimeter of the fences serve as more than structural support. Fast growing and anchored by dense root systems that help prevent soil erosion, broad crowns of willow branches and leaves provide shade and create barriers against wind and pests. As the trees grow taller, they also provide a natural trellis on which vine crops can climb to facilitate better access to sunlight. The microecosystem of the chinampas supports biodiversity & plays host to beneficial bacterial & fungal species. The microecosystem of the chinampas also supports biodiversity and plays host to beneficial bacterial and fungal species. Because so much of the layered soil in the chinampas comes from the lakebed, algae, bacteria, and macrophytes proliferate in the soil. These organisms consume and convert the nutrients from decaying organic matter, storing excess nitrogen and phosphorus as a survival mechanism for use in nutrient-deficient conditions. Through this process, these bacteria increase the nitrogen reserves of the soil. When new soil is added to the surface, it introduces more organic matter and moisture, feeding the algae, bacteria, and macrophytes and propagating the nitrogen-fixing cycle. As an example of raised farming, chinampas are similar to structures from other parts of the Americas, including the raised gardens of Lake Titicaca, and other raised farming techniques have been recorded in regions including the Netherlands, Denmark, Russia, France, and Bangladesh. In all of these cases, raised farming techniques promote soil quality, aeration, and moisture content through drainage, and in some cases, like Mexico's chinampas, this technique enables agricultural production in environments where it would otherwise be impossible. While this was not an innovation of Aztec agriculture, it was perfected under the sway of their empire such that, in the 15th and 16th centuries, the chinampas of Mesoamerica fed hundreds of thousands of people. Remove Ads  Chinampas of Tenochtitlan, Lake Texcoco & Xochimilco When the Mexica (pronounced \"Me-SHEE-kuh\") people came to the Valley of Mexico, they found a land already dominated by other cultural and ethnic groups, and they depended on mercenary work to sustain themselves. After years of wandering in search of political security, the Mexica resolved to build their home on Lake Texcoco, taking a location that no one else wanted and transforming it into the heart of an empire. The Aztec civilization that rose from those swampy waters was so enduring that the symbol of the city's god-given founding portent   an eagle seated on a cactus eating a snake   remains the central element on the flag of Mexico today. Map of the Aztec Empire, c. 1427 1521 Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) Part of the reason that no other people had settled the region around Lake Texcoco was that Mesoamericans depended almost wholly on agriculture for sustenance. Supplemented by game animals and a very select few domesticated species, Mesoamerican peoples primarily ate fruits and vegetables and thus required a great deal of agricultural infrastructure. With little arable land around Lake Texcoco, chinampas emerged as an elegant and effective solution to the problem of food. The early Aztecs were most likely inspired by their rivals in Xochimilco, which means \"flowering fields\" in Nahuatl, where chinampas were already flourishing before the founding of Tenochtitlan. Resolved to thrive in their newfound home, the people of Lake Texcoco set about filling the shallow waters with farmland. The Florentine Codex describes a type of land called atlalli, which is a combination of atl, meaning \"water,\" and tlalli, meaning \"earth,\" in Nahuatl. In describing what makes this land unique from other forms of tlalli, the Nahuatl author tells us, \"This is the irrigated field. It is a watered garden, one which can be irrigated it is good, fine, precious; a source of food, esteemed; a place of fertility to be planted to maize, to be planted to beans, to be harvested\" (Book 11, folio 227v - 228r, translated by Anderson & Dibble). The image below shows a farmer at work, standing between tendrils and pools of water. The artist signifies the fertility of the land not only through the contrast of textures between the curling water and the tufted earth but also by the presence of stems and flowers, particularly some that resemble corn plants, near the end of the branches of moisture. Remove Ads  Atlalli Aztec Irrigation The Florentine Codex (CC BY-NC-ND) Over the course of the nearly two centuries of Aztec rule, chinamperos tended to the artificial island farms, and the government controlled and regulated all aspects of maintenance with an emphasis on economizing the use of time, produce, and waste. In fact, the fertilization of the chinampas was integrated into the lavatory practices of the people of the city. Inhabitants of Tenochtitlan relieved themselves in specialized huts built near city streets and alleys, where canoes would collect the human excrement. From there, it was transported directly to the chinampas, where it would be used as fertilizer along with plant matter and other nutrient-rich organic material. In addition to the fertilization methods mentioned above, Aztec chinamperos left their farm-islands fallow after two or three years of use to allow the soil to rest before further cultivation. Through this carefully organized system, Aztec-era chinampas could support seven different crops in their year-round cycle. Crop productivity was maximized by allowing seeds to germinate in seedbeds before being introduced to the chinampas. While other crops grew in the full-sized plots, farmers planted seeds in small squares of soil called chap nes, where they grew for a few weeks before being transplanted into the chinampa soil, fertilized, and gently covered with a layer of native straw and reeds. This layer of vegetation would protect the new seedlings from the sun and help trap the humidity in the soil. Finally, the crops were sprayed with a solution of ground chiles and water to control pests. Once fully grown, the crops were harvested, loaded directly into boats, and sent to the bustling markets that surrounded Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs, like many Indigenous American populations, employed, among other plants, a sort of sacred trinity of food crops: corn, beans, and squash. Sometimes known to Indigenous populations as \"The Three Sisters,\" these species thrive when planted together in a shared space because each of the crops provides some form of support for the others. Corn plants provide a natural trellis on which bean plants climb to thrive, and bean plants absorb nitrogen from the air, which they convert to nitrates that help fertilize the surrounding soil. Squash leaves provide ground cover that inhibits soil evaporation and the growth of weeds, ensuring their neighbors' access to moist, nutrient-rich soil. While the Aztecs would not have used the title \"The Three Sisters\" to describe their intercropping techniques, corn, beans, and squash were nonetheless staples of the Aztec diet, and the chinampa farming zones on Lake Xochimilco produced enough crops to feed approximately 100,000 people during the height of the Aztec empire. The Florentine Codex preserves an image of corn described as cintli: \"the white maize ear that of the irrigated lands, that of the fields, that of the chinampas.\" (Book 11, folio 246v, translated by Anderson & Dibble) Cintli Maize Plant Unknown Artist (CC BY-NC-ND) In addition to the crops needed to sustain Tenochtitlan's population, Aztec chinamperos often planted flowers in their floating island plots. Far from simply being a source of beauty, flowers were symbolically important throughout Mesoamerican cultures. Known as xochitl (\"SHOW-cheet\") in Nahuatl, flowers were also offerings in Aztec sacrifice rituals. Three deities who had particularly associations with them, Xochipilli, Xochiquetzal, and Macuilxochitl, were worshipped as patrons of the arts, beauty, and pleasure. Xochitl in cuicatl, meaning \"flowers and song,\" was a metaphorical turn of phrase in Nahuatl that could be used to refer to all manner of artistic endeavors, particularly the deeply valued Aztec art of poetry. Whether worn by dancing women during celebrations, carried to signify the presence of a god on earth, or offered to honor the gods on sacred days, the flowers of Tenochtitlan grew on chinampas. Chinampas Today Recent surveys show that chinampas were in use in Mesoamerica as early as 1000 BCE, and though most of the great lakes that once housed the heart of Aztec civilization were drained long ago, a few chinampas still feed the people of Mexico City after hundreds of years. While there are about 5,000 acres of extant chinampas, only about 2.5 percent of those are still used for agriculture, and the chinamperos that farm them employ both traditional and modern techniques. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! Besides their cultural, agricultural, and social value, the chinampas also represent the last natural haven for axolotls in the wild. Named in Nahuatl, like the irrigated land itself, after atl (\"water\") and the Aztec god Xolotl, axolotls are critically endangered amphibians whose unique regenerative capabilities   they can regrow limbs, eyes, and portions of their brains   make them an active subject of medical research. They were well known to the Aztecs and seem to have thrived in the basin of Mexico before the conquest, despite being a particularly esteemed part of the Aztec diet, described in the Florentine Codex as \"a meal fit for lords.\" (Book 11, folio 68r, translated by Anderson & Dibble). Axolotl Unknown Artist (CC BY-NC-ND) Today, scientists estimate that there are about 50 to 1,000 individuals left in the wild, and the combination of urban expansion and the decline of the cultivation of chinampas for agriculture has drastically reduced their habitat. The infrastructure of the floating farms, particularly the small canals that branch from larger waterways, provide axolotls with refuge from the invasive carp and tilapia, introduced to the ecosystem in the 1960s, that compete with them for food resources and prey on their young. The ecosystemic relationship between these unique amphibians and Mexico's farm-islands is enshrined on the 2021 50 peso note, which depicts an axolotl suspended in rippling canal waters, surrounded by crop-filled chinampas, and fenced in by the willows and reeds that form the salamander's natural habitat. In the background, a corn plant rendered in ethereal gold rises like the sun, and the text commemorates the environment of Xochimilco in its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Invaluable to the axolotls, modern chinampas also benefit local human populations by providing ecosystemic services, including water filtration, microclimate regulation, increased agro- and biodiversity, regulation of water levels, and the capture and sequestration of greenhouse gases. But the mere presence of chinampas cannot provide these services without care and maintenance. A number of agencies and organizations are actively pursuing conservation efforts to preserve and revitalize the chinampas of the basin of Mexico, but the trends are not promising. Even with ambitious local initiatives, the outlook is alarming. A projection for the year 2057 assumes that in Xochimilco, without a concerted effort from the involved players (particularly farmers and local government), most current chinampa land will be converted to housing. (Ebel 2019) Now, as in the time of the Aztecs, caring for and cultivating chinampas is a labor-intensive process. Today, a few people safeguard centuries-old farming techniques, and relatively few strive to sustain the whole system of chinampa agriculture from what would seem to be its inevitable decay. In 2022, researchers estimated that 90 percent of chinampas in Xochimilco and the surrounding area had been abandoned, and while the pandemic stoked some interest in the efforts to revitalize chinampas and further support chinamperos, Alejandra Borunda, writing for National Geographic magazine, noted that chinampas represent \"1,000 years of history, still alive for now.\" (Borunda 2022).",

        "title": "Potsdam Conference: When the WWII Allies Declared Japan Must Surrender",
        "content": "Attlee, Truman & Stalin, Potsdam, 1945 Unknown Photographer (Public Domain) The Potsdam Conference, held from 17 July to 2 August 1945 in Potsdam in eastern Germany, decided how the Allies would deal with a defeated Germany and how they could best conduct the ongoing campaign against Japan as the Second World War (1939-45) drew to a close. With victory in Europe achieved, US President Harry S. Truman, UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and then his successor, Clement Attlee, and the Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin issued a surrender ultimatum to Japan, known as the Potsdam Declaration. The ultimatum was ignored until US aircraft dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan surrendered on 14 August. Agreement at Yalta In February 1945, as victory seemed imminent for the Allies in the Second World War, the leaders of 'the Big Three' met at Yalta in the Crimea: President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and the Russian Premier Joseph Stalin. On the discussion table were such topics as how to deal with a defeated Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, and how to set up the United Nations, successor to the League of Nations. Poland's borders were to be shifted westwards, giving the USSR the eastern slice while acquiring a new western slice from Germany. It was agreed in principle to allow democratic elections in countries Nazi Germany had occupied. This sentiment was expressed in the Declaration on Liberated Europe. Remove Ads  Germany and Austria, in contrast, were to be divided into four zones of occupation (US, French, British, and Russian) with a joint military government established in each, the Allied Control Council in Germany and the Inter-Allied Council in Austria. Berlin and Vienna were similarly divided into zones of control. In addition, it was decided that each power had the right to conduct war crimes trials within its zone of occupation. Including France as an occupying power of Germany and Austria was a Western 'victory' at Yalta, as was the decision to allow France a permanent seat on the UN's governing Security Council. Another major agreement at Yalta concerned the still ongoing fighting with Japan. In return for Russia's entering the war against Japan, certain Soviet demands would be met. These demands included control of the Kuril (aka Kurile) Islands, the southern part of Sakhalin Island (both of these are in the Sea of Okhotsk and had been occupied by Japan), and retaining the status quo regarding Mongolia, which had been a Russian client state since 1924. There were many issues still unresolved, and so the 'Big Three' planned to meet again in July, this time at Potsdam, in Germany, an area then under Soviet military control. Remove Ads  Churchill, Roosevelt, & Stalin in Yalta, 1945 Imperial War Musuems (CC BY-NC-SA) Potsdam & New Faces The Potsdam Conference was held at Schloss Cecilienhof, not an imposing castle but more of a comfortable mansion set in a grand park outside Berlin. The meeting at Potsdam was given the code name Terminal. As at Yalta, the leaders of Great Britain, the USA, and the USSR still considered themselves the legitimate decision-makers for the fate of other nations largely because of the size of the armies they commanded and their successes on the battlefield, at sea, and in the air. Roosevelt had died since Yalta, and Churchill lost the general election in the middle of the conference (the results were announced on 26 July). Consequently, the new leaders were President Harry S. Truman and, from 28 July, Prime Minister Clement Attlee (who had previously been attending the conference as Churchill's deputy). THE LEADERS AT POTSDAM DISAGREED ON MANY KEY ISSUES & FREQUENTLY POSTPONED DECISIONS TO A FUTURE CONFERENCE OF FOREIGN MINISTERS. Stalin, then, had the advantage of experience, and, further, he was, according to Anthony Eden, the former British foreign minister, \"a cold, cool and a calculating negotiator who knew exactly what he wanted to get and went out to get it, never got excited, hardly ever raised his voice\" (Holmes, 541). Germany had surrendered in April 1945, and the USSR's Red Army had occupied Berlin. As the Imperial War Museum notes, Stalin was determined to get the best possible deal from his two counterparts at Potsdam: \"When asked if he felt great satisfaction at being in Berlin, Stalin replied 'Tsar Alexander got to Paris'\". Truman, after his first face-to-face meeting with Stalin and a lunch of liver, bacon, and Californian wine, wrote in his diary that the Russian leader was \"smart as hell\" (Moskin, 203). Clearly, the negotiations on what the post-war world would look like were going to be tough. Remove Ads  Germany's Punishment The attempt to reach an agreement on the war reparations Germany should pay to the victors was not successful. Stalin was determined to squeeze the maximum possible from Germany to help pay for the tremendous damage inflicted on the USSR. Truman, on the other hand, was wary that if the terms were too harsh, they might provoke a lasting hatred of the victors, such as had been seen in Germany after the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, which formally concluded the First World War. There were some points of agreement regarding Germany at Potsdam. Germany's military industry was to be dismantled. Nazi race laws like the Nuremberg Laws would be repealed, and there was to be a systematic denazification of the judicial and education systems. Potsdam Conference Delegates Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Redrawing Europe One point of discussion was the 'Poland Problem'. At Yalta, everyone had agreed there should be free elections in Poland, but Stalin had already interfered to make sure there was a pro-Soviet government installed there. Stalin was determined that Poland would be a huge buffer zone that would protect Russia from any future attack from Western Europe. The USA and Britain had, nevertheless, recognised Poland's new 'Provisional Government of National Unity' on 5 July. The reality was that the USSR's armed forces already had possession of the territory in question. The make-up of the new governments in Bulgaria and Greece was likewise disputed, with the Americans and British wanting free elections, but Stalin wanted the placement of Communists within these governments, no matter what, just as had already been done in Romania. It was decided at Potsdam that a Council of Foreign Ministers would be formed to define the new borders within Europe and decide how to carve up the various colonies of the war's losing powers. This was, in effect, a postponement of several issues where no agreement could be reached; there were many. The Council was not held until February 1947. By postponing the more prickly problems, the three leaders were at least able to press on with their quasi-cordial discussions. One issue settled at Potsdam was the decision to continue the Lend-Lease programme (material and financial aid from the USA to its Allies) to British occupation troops in Europe. Remove Ads  Achieving Victory against Japan The most important point of discussion at Potsdam was the peace terms regarding Japan. The United States had already developed the atomic bomb, a terrifying new weapon whose power was so great it was not fully understood. Indeed, Truman had delayed the Potsdam Conference in order for the first atomic bomb test to be completed in New Mexico on 16 July. Truman, then, knew by the time he arrived at Potsdam that he held in his hands the means to end the war almost immediately. The US Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, noted that news of the successful test had the following effect on Truman: \"The President was tremendously pepped up by it he said it gave him an entirely new feeling of confidence\" (Liddell Hart, 438). Leaders & Foreign Ministers at the Potsdam Conference Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) What has become known as the Potsdam Declaration was made on 27 July. The main message of the declaration was that Japan should immediately offer an unconditional surrender or else face complete destruction. The declaration was approved by both the British and Chinese governments. The declaration made no mention of the Japanese Emperor, and the Japanese government took this to mean he would not be obliged to abdicate. Japan was still fighting to hold on to each and every island and causing heavy casualties amongst the US forces. The Japanese military government ignored the declaration, despite having already made secret overtures to the government of the USSR that it was willing to consider a surrender. Inside the Japanese cabinet, it was felt that there was still some room for negotiation despite the stark terms of the declaration; certainly, they felt they had some time to further consider the ultimatum. The Japanese military government still hoped that a negotiated surrender might preserve it some vestige of power. The Potsdam Declaration, however, clearly stated this would not be tolerated and called for the removal of \"the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest\" (Dear, 864). This might or might not include the emperor. Further, the Japanese military must be disarmed, the state of Japan would henceforth be made up of only its four main islands, and war crimes trials would be conducted. The Allies hoped to foster a free and democratic Japan, where there was freedom of speech and religion and a respect for human rights. With victory in the war already assured, Truman was concerned with the supremacy of the United States in the post-war world. Without a surrender, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff expected continued and desperate resistance from the Japanese military, which still possessed some 2 million soldiers, and that, as a consequence, the war could not be won before the winter of 1946. It was estimated that victory using conventional arms would result in at least 200,000 US casualties, perhaps five times more. Further, if the USSR entered the war against Japan, as was promised and expected, that state might then make territorial claims in East Asia. The USSR, by actively helping in the defeat of Japan, would also strengthen its position in a divided Europe. Truman felt that \"only an actual atomic raid would convince Stalin of the irresistible force behind America's diplomacy\" (Liddell Hart, 438). Truman had rather vaguely informed Stalin on 24 July about the bomb (information Soviet spies had already passed on to Stalin). Truman declared that the United States had a weapon of unusual power and that he was prepared to use it against Japan. Stalin replied that this intention was a good idea. With victory in the war already assured, Truman was concerned with the supremacy of the United States in the post-war world just as much as he was with defeating Japan as quickly as possible. It is also true that the Manhattan Project to develop the bomb had cost $2 billion. To many involved in the atomic programme, it seemed unthinkable not to use the bomb now that it was ready. Remove Ads  With no response to the Potsdam Declaration, the United States government, with the formal approval of the British government, decided to drop a single atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August and another bomb on Nagasaki on 9 August. The bombs were dropped by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress planes Enola Gay and Bockscar. Over 200,000 people were killed in the attacks. On 10 August, the USSR's Red Army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria. The emperor of Japan, Hirohito, announced his country's surrender on 14 August. Truman responded to the surrender later that same day by declaring to reporters in a press conference: \"I deem this reply a full acceptance of the Potsdam declaration which specifies the unconditional surrender of Japan. In the reply there is no qualification\" (Moskin, 319). The Allies had won WWII. Hiroshima after the Atomic Bomb Attack Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The Cold War Potsdam, like the Yalta Conference, proved to be something of a disappointment for the West. At Potsdam, \"agreements with Moscow were more the exception than the rule\" (Dear, 878). Truman wrote to his mother near the conference's end: \"You never saw such pigheaded people as are the Russians. I hope I never have to hold another conference with them\" (Dear, 878). There was certainly a general feeling in the United States that as the USSR increasingly defaulted on the few commitments it had made at Yalta and Potsdam, the Americans had, in effect, \"won the war but lost the peace\" (Liddell Hart, 435). It was felt by many in the West that their leaders had negotiated away control of Eastern Europe to the USSR and permitted a Soviet presence in East Asia, which could be used as a platform for further expansion of Soviet influence in that part of the world. For this reason, the United States kept occupying troops in Japan until 1952. Emperor Hirohito was permitted to keep his position, but after renouncing his divinity as claimed by the Shinto religion, his role was redefined as a constitutional monarch. Hirohito's efforts to curb the Japanese military and promote a surrender had saved him, although historians continue to dispute just how great those efforts had been in reality. There has also been much debate ever since 1945 about whether Russia's declaration of war on Japan just before the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had any influence on the Japanese government's decision to surrender, and so whether the USA's compromises concerning Asia at Yalta and Potsdam had been, in the end, strictly necessary. Between the USA and USSR and their respective allies, there developed serious suspicions as to everyone's foreign policy aims. So the Cold War began, a decline in US-Soviet relations, which saw a prolonged period of international tensions and proxy wars throughout the second half of the 20th century.",

        "content": "William Barret Travis, Commander of the Alamo Henry Arthur McArdle (Public Domain) William Barret Travis (1809 to 1836) is best-known as the commander of the Alamo during the 13-day siege (23 February to 6 March 1836), dying in the Battle of the Alamo on 6 March at the age of 26. Arguably, however, Travis should receive greater recognition as the man who almost single-handedly started the Texas Revolution with the Anahuac Disturbances of 1832 and 1835. Travis  conflict with the commander of the Anahuac garrison, Juan Davis Bradburn, in 1832, and his victory over Mexican troops in the same region in 1835, are often sidelined in discussions of the Texas Revolution as they did not lead to further engagement. The Battle of Gonzales (2 October 1835) is understood as the beginning of the revolution because it led directly to the continuous conflict that ended with the Texian victory at the Battle of San Jacinto on 21 April 1836. Remove Ads  Even so, Travis was the first member of the so-called War Party, seeking to separate Texas from Mexico, who took action, making a name for himself at Anahuac less than a year before he would die at the Alamo. And yet, prior to his arrival in Texas, it is hard to imagine a less-likely hero than William Barret Travis. Early Life The family name was originally Travers and they established themselves at the Jamestown Colony of Virginia in 1627. Berwick Travers, Travis  grandfather, later moved to the region that would become South Carolina, married Ann Smallwood, and had seven children, among them Mark and Alexander. The spelling of the family name changed from Travers to Travis and the name  Berwick  became  Barret.  William Barret Travis was born 1 August (some sources give 9 August) 1809, the son of Mark Travis and Jemima Stallworth, one of ten children. Remove Ads  Travis started a newspaper, the Claiborne Herald. Mark was a prosperous farmer and Alexander a popular preacher. In 1817, Alexander moved to Alabama and Mark soon followed with his family. William, after learning the basics at public school, continued his education at the Sparta Academy where Alexander served as superintendent. Travis was a bright student, mastering the curriculum of Greek, Latin, French, philosophy, rhetoric, geography, history, and mathematics (Davis, 193). On graduating, Alexander enrolled him at another academy in Claiborne and, when he graduated at the age of 18, he became an instructor there. William B. Travis Wiley Martin (Public Domain) He understood, however, that teaching would not provide him with the income for the life he imagined for himself. Travis apprenticed himself to the attorney James Dellet and applied himself to learning law as he had his earlier studies. At the same time, he started a newspaper, the Claiborne Herald, which he ran entirely himself, writing the articles, setting the type, and selling subscriptions. Remove Ads  While teaching, Travis had fallen in love with one of his students, Rosanna Cato (three years his junior), and the two were married 26 October 1828. Scholar J.R. Edmondson comments: Hopelessly smitten, [Travis] referred to her as  the beautiful Miss Cato.  She apparently liked what she saw. Travis had blue eyes, light, reddish-brown hair, and what one acquaintance described as  a fine Saxon face.  At nineteen years old, he had matured into a big-boned man who stood about five feet, ten inches tall. (146) At first, the couple seem to have been very happy together. Their first child, Charles Edward Travis, was born 8 August 1829, the Herald was making some money, and he was working well with Dellet. This all changed as Travis began to struggle to provide for his family, juggling his time between his law practice, the paper, his enlistment in the Alabama militia, duties at the Masonic Lodge, and his young wife and son. Still, by the time he was 20, he was a lawyer, publisher, teacher, and writer, well-respected by his community, and backed by the powerful and popular Dellet. Home of William B. Travis Jeff Reed (CC BY-SA) No matter how hard he tried, however, he could not make ends meet. He borrowed money from almost everyone he knew   his wife s brother and Dellet included   and began gambling hoping to  hit it big  to be able to pay them all back and still maintain his family and lifestyle. Gambling only added to his debt   which was around $800 (roughly $20,000 today) - and, in 1831, Dellet and the others filed suit against him. The court found against Travis and a warrant was issued for his arrest in March 1831. Remove Ads  Life with Rosanna had become increasingly difficult as he failed to provide for her and their son and, by this time, she was expecting another child. His newspaper had failed, his law practice was nearly non-existent, and now he was facing prison. He had heard of Texas as a land of new beginnings - and few lawyers - and so, telling Rosanna he would go make money there and then come back for her and square all debts, he left Claiborne   and would never return. Anglo-Americans in Texas 1823-1830 Mexico had won independence from Spain in 1821 and, to increase its tax base   as well as create a buffer between southern Mexico and Native American territory   invited Anglo-Americans to settle in the district of Coahuila y Tejas (Texas). Stephen F. Austin, like his father before him, became an empresario, selling lands to Anglo-American immigrants. Austin s initial land grants were approved by the Mexican government in 1823, bringing 300 families from the United States, many of them arriving with their slaves. The first sign of friction between Anglo-American immigrants and the Mexican authorities was the Fredonian Rebellion of 21 December 1826 to 31 January 1827 in which Anglo-American settlers under the empresario Haden Edwards declared themselves the independent Republic of Fredonia in the region near Nacogdoches. This revolt was not supported by Austin or any others outside of Edwards  settlement and was swiftly crushed by the Mexican army. Contrary to the claims of some historians, this was not the beginning of the Texas Revolution   but it certainly encouraged some, who would eventually form the War Party, to consider establishing an independent Republic of Texas. Remove Ads  In 1829, Mexico abolished slavery but, when the Anglo-Americans objected, concessions were made so that they could keep their slaves. In 1830, however, President Anastasio Bustamante rescinded these concessions through the Laws of April 6, 1830, which also banned further immigration from the USA and raised taxes on those already in Texas. The Anglo-American settlers, now calling themselves Texians, strongly objected to these laws and tensions rose between them and the regional Mexican authorities. Travis was granted land and established his law practice at Anahuac. This situation created two  parties  among the Anglo colonists   although these were never official parties, simply factions of the population   the Peace Party, which sought to negotiate better terms and laws with Mexico, and the War Party, which advocated for armed rebellion and the establishment of an independent nation. Anahuac Disturbances Into the midst of all of this rode Travis, arriving in San Felipe in 1831 as an illegal immigrant. He was granted land by Austin and established his law practice at Anahuac. On legal forms he claimed he was single or, at other times, a widower. Unlike other immigrants, Travis learned Spanish, hoping this would help him acquire more clients. He also joined the local militia and, quickly, became a prominent supporter of the War Party. His first clash with Mexican authorities came in the form of Juan Davis Bradburn, who had been born John Davis Bradburn in Virginia in 1787. He had fought in the War of 1812 at the Battle of New Orleans before enlisting in the Mexican army fighting for independence from Spain. In 1830, he was given command of the post at Anahuac. Frank W. Johnson Unknown Photographer (Public Domain) The Texians at first welcomed Bradburn, thinking that, as a fellow American, he would allow them greater freedoms. They had no idea who they were dealing with. Bradburn had fully embraced his adopted country and was intent on upholding its laws. He could not force the Texians to free their slaves without risking an uprising, but he certainly was not going to help anyone keep them. In August 1831, two slaves (sometimes given as three) escaped from a William M. Logan of Louisiana and fled to Texas. Bradburn took them in, hiring them to work on his estate. In May 1832, Logan hired Travis to get them back and, when Bradburn refused, Travis sent an anonymous letter warning him that Logan and 100 armed men would soon arrive to take the slaves by force if they were not soon surrendered. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! Bradburn saw through the ploy and had Travis arrested for threatening a Mexican official. When Travis  law partner, Patrick C. Jack, stormed into Bradburn s office to protest, he was also arrested, as were a handful of other Texians Bradburn accused of theft. Bradburn wanted his prisoners transferred to Matamoros to be tried on charges of treason and this roused the War Party of Anahuac under Frank W. Johnson who, with his militia of around 150 men, took over the buildings around Bradburn s post, demanding he surrender Travis and the others. Johnson had captured 19 Mexican cavalry officers and negotiated an exchange while, at around this same time, others of the militia, under the command of John Austin (no relation to Stephen F. Austin), left to bring a cannon and reinforcements back from Brazoria to force Bradburn to surrender his post. While Austin was en route (and, incidentally, fighting the Battle of Fort Velasco), Bradburn agreed to Johnson s terms and the prisoners were freed. Bradburn was replaced and fled to Louisiana   and Travis became a hero of the War Party. He left Anahuac for San Felipe, where his law practice boomed, and he became a celebrity. In July 1835, he returned to Anahuac and assumed an even larger role when, commanding a force of 25 men, he captured and disarmed 40 Mexican troops who had arrested two Texians for their protests against taxes. General Martin Perfecto de Cos, the brother-in-law of General (and president) Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, ordered Travis  arrest but the Texians would not surrender him. Travis was given a commission of Lieutenant Colonel of Cavalry and then left Anahuac to return to San Felipe. Mexican General Mart n Perfecto de Cos Unknown (Public Domain) Prosperity & Romance Travis did well in San Felipe. Scholar William C. Davis writes: With Travis  growing prosperity came a steady maturing in his attitude toward debt  He engaged a friend who was traveling back to Alabama to go to Claiborne and redeem all those outstanding notes, a step on the road to regaining his reputation. (281) Since his arrival in Texas, he had sent his wife nothing by way of support, relying on her family, who had money, to care for her and his two children, Charles Edward and Susan (born in 1831 after his departure). Upon hearing that Travis had cleared all his debts in Claiborne, but had not sent her anything, Rosanna filed for divorce on grounds of abandonment, which became official in January 1836. Remove Ads  Travis, meanwhile, was making more money than ever before, purchasing and hiring out slaves, among them, Joe (the only male survivor of the Alamo). He also enjoyed the life of a bachelor in San Felipe. Beginning in 1833, Travis visited the crossing at Mill Creek where there was a popular inn operated by one John Cummings. His sister, Rebecca, attracted Travis  attention. He paid for a Christmas party held there in 1833, began a courtship, and, by February 1834, had told Rebecca about Rosanna and how he was not yet divorced but, as soon as that could be resolved, they could be married. She tentatively agreed but demanded he give up gambling, which he did. To seal their agreement, she gave him a ring which he would later give to the infant Angelina Dickinson at the Alamo and, today, can be seen in one of the exhibits in the Alamo chapel. Interior of the Alamo Chapel, 2025 Gatorfan252525 (CC BY-SA) Travis & the Texas Revolution Throughout 1834 and into 1835, Travis became increasingly involved with the War Party seeking independence from Mexico. By 1835, Santa Anna had abolished the Federalist Constitution of 1824   which had granted Anglo-Americans a voice in government, as well as other freedoms   and the War Party characterized the new Mexican government as an oppressive dictatorship. In July 1835, as noted, he returned to Anahuac to free the two Texians the War Party claimed had been unjustly arrested. He missed out on the Battle of Gonzales on 2 October of 1835, because of a bad cold and sore throat, but commanded a cavalry unit as a scout during the Siege of Bexar (12 October to 11 December 1835). The siege ended with the surrender of General Cos, who had fortified the old mission-become-fort, the Alamo and, with Cos  retreat from Texas, many felt the war was over and independence had been won. There were many others who did not believe this, however, and among them were Colonel James C. Neill, General Sam Houston, James  Jim  Bowie, and Travis. Neill had taken control of the Alamo in December 1835, and, in January 1836, Travis was sent to reinforce him, arriving at the Alamo in early February 1836. The Battle of the Alamo, 1836 Nicha Sursock (CC BY-NC-SA) Command of the Alamo Jim Bowie had gotten there earlier with orders from Houston to remove all ordnance and destroy the fort. He and Neill, however, felt the Alamo should be held against what they saw as the inevitable return of Santa Anna s forces. On 11 February, Neill left to tend to personal business and Travis assumed his command. This led to a dispute between Bowie and Travis as to who should command the garrison overall. Remove Ads  A compromise was reached in which Travis would command his men and Neill s and Bowie would have authority over his own. Any decisions affecting the entire garrison would be made together. Travis was certain that Santa Anna, if he did come, would not arrive before mid-to-late March and sent out letters asking for reinforcements   especially to Colonel James W. Fannin at Goliad   while he supervised repairs to the Alamo s walls. Reports that Santa Anna was marching toward the Alamo began as early as 14 February, but these were dismissed as rumors and gossip. On 23 February, Santa Anna marched into San Antonio de Bexar   and the siege of the Alamo began. On the 24th, Bowie fell ill, and Travis assumed sole command of the garrison. Plaque of William Barret Travis's Letter from the Alamo Betsy Mark (CC BY-NC-SA) Siege & Battle of the Alamo On 24 February, Travis sent the most famous letter of his many asking for help   the so-called Travis Letter   also known as the  Victory or Death  Letter: To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World: Fellow citizens and compatriots -I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism and everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country. VICTORY or DEATH. William Barret Travis Lt. Col. Comdt. P.S. The Lord is on our side. When the enemy appeared in sight, we had not three bushels of corn. We have since found in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels and got into the walls 20 or 30 head of Beeves. Travis (Groneman, 4) This letter, hailed as  the most patriotic , has become famous world-wide and would later encourage others to flock to the cause of Texas liberty, but, sadly for Travis, did little to bring reinforcements to the Alamo. On 1 March, 32 volunteers from Gonzales arrived but Fannin failed spectacularly in his paltry attempt to lend aid and wound up dying in the Goliad Massacre on 27 March 1836. Sam Houston dismissed the letter as a literary exaggeration and refused to believe Santa Anna was even in Texas until 11 March when Susanna Dickinson (with her infant daughter Angelina) and Travis' slave, Joe, brought word to Gonzales that the Alamo had fallen. According to Alamo lore, on 5 March, Travis drew a line in the sand of the Alamo courtyard, informing the garrison that their situation was hopeless without reinforcement, and asking anyone who would stand with him to step across - any others were free to leave. Only one man, Louis Moses Rose, is said to have left. Travis held the Alamo against overwhelming odds for 13 days and was among the first to die in the assault of 6 March. All the defenders of the Alamo were killed, including David  Davy  Crockett of Tennessee. William B. Travis Plaque Betsy Mark (CC BY-NC-SA) Conclusion Possibly before, but certainly after his arrival in Texas, Travis came to see himself as a great romantic hero, along the lines of King Arthur, fighting for the cause of right against what he saw as the forces of darkness. Although his early life would hardly suggest a future as a great hero of Texas liberty and personal sacrifice, through his self-image, he became what he believed himself to be, even dying for it. Travis features prominently on the Alamo cenotaph, commissioned in 1936 for the Texan Centennial, and has been portrayed in many TV shows, documentaries, and movies, notably by Lawrence Harvey in The Alamo (1960), by Alec Baldwin in The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory (1987), and by Patrick Wilson in The Alamo (2004)   considered the most accurate film version of the siege, battle, and Travis himself.

        "content": "Raid on Deerfield, 1704 Walter Henry Lippincott (Public Domain) Queen Anne s War (1702-1713) was the second major colonial conflict in North America, fought between the colonies of England   Great Britain after 1707   and those of France and Spain, each side aided by their respective Native American allies. An extension of a larger European conflict, the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), Queen Anne s War had its own unique origins, stemming from the tempestuous politics of Colonial America. The war officially began when Anne, Queen of Great Britain (reign 1702-1714)   after whom the North American conflict was named   declared war on France and Spain, in response to a dispute over who would inherit the Spanish throne. This dynastic war, though of little significance to the colonists on the North American frontier, would nevertheless reignite tensions that had been simmering since the last colonial war. New France, for instance, was quarreling with its English rivals over control of the lucrative fur trade as well as over a border dispute between its colony of Acadia and the New England territory of Maine. The indigenous Wabanaki Confederacy had a generations-long feud with the New England colonies as well, stretching back to the violence of King Philip s War (1675-1678). And, in the south, the English Province of Carolina contended with its own rival, Spanish Florida, which sometimes authorized Native American raids into Carolinian territory. So, when word of Queen Anne s declaration of war reached American shores, the colonies and Native American nations readily engaged in a ferocious war of their own characterized by bloody cycles of retaliatory raids and deadly frontier skirmishes. Remove Ads  New France had long been struggling with its English rivals over control of the lucrative beaver pelt trade. Background At the turn of the 18th century, Colonial America was a tinderbox. Decades of tensions, arising from issues such as border disputes, dishonored treaties, and the struggle over resources, had already led to the bloodletting of King William s War (1688-1697). However, this conflict, quite limited in scope, had achieved little besides the burning of frontier villages and the killing or kidnapping of their inhabitants, serving to heighten the animosity between the English colonies on one side, and New France on the other. One major point of contention was in the northeast, in modern-day Maine, which was claimed both by the French colony of Acadia (modern-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and the New England colonies. Maine had been the site of the most brutal fighting of the previous war, its settlements still scarred by the flames, the graves of the slain still fresh in its soil. New France had also long been struggling with its English rivals over control of the lucrative beaver pelt trade in the Great Lakes region. While the English enjoyed a numerical advantage over their French rivals   the population of the English colonies was approaching 200,000 by 1700, while New France had less than 20,000   the French had better leadership and more settlers with military experience, helping to even the odds. Anne, Queen of Great Britain Unknown Artist (Public Domain) Though the rivalry between these two European powers lay at the center of the political tensions, a few powerful Indigenous polities could not be ignored. One of these, the Wabanaki Confederacy, had been fighting against the New Englanders for decades; several times, the Wabanakis and the English had signed peace treaties, only for the English to later trample over these agreements and encroach further onto Wabanaki land. In response, the Wabanakis had aligned themselves closer with the French, intermarrying with French settlers and allowing Jesuit missionaries in their midst. During King William s War, it had been the Wabanakis who had conducted most of the raids on New England towns, striking terror and fear into the hearts of the English settlers. Another Native American polity was the Iroquois Confederacy, which had been allied with the English during King William s War only to find themselves abandoned at the end of it. When the English made peace with the French in 1697, they neglected to provide for their Iroquois allies. Thus, the Iroquois were left to keep fighting the French by themselves. Many of their villages were burned and people killed by the vengeful French, before the Iroquois were able to finalize their own peace treaty in 1701. The Iroquois, understandably, accused the English of abandoning them, and were unlikely to want to help should a second colonial war break out. Remove Ads  A cycle of retaliatory raids continued between the Spanish in Florida and the English in Carolina. Such a war, it would turn out, was not long in coming. But the spark that would ignite this North American tinderbox would come from thousands of miles away, over in Europe. In November 1700, King Charles II of Spain died without children. The vacant Spanish throne was duly claimed by a member of the French Bourbon dynasty, a grandson of King Louis XIV, a move that alarmed some of the other European nations who feared that a union between France and Spain would upset the delicate balance of power. These nations, a powerful coalition including England, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Dutch Republic, instead favored a candidate from the Habsburg dynasty to succeed to the throne of Spain. This dispute ultimately led to the War of the Spanish Succession, as the pro-Bourbon and pro-Habsburg alliances vied for control of the Spanish Empire. At first, England and France tried to make a deal to keep their overseas colonies neutral in the struggle. But, by the time word reached Colonial America that war had broken out in Europe in 1702, there was nothing that could put the genie back in the bottle. A new colonial war had begun. War in the South Unlike King William s War, which had been mostly confined to New England and Canada, this new conflict would be fought on a wider scale, with the first salvoes of fighting fired off in the South. By this point, both the English and French colonists were racing to secure trade access to the Mississippi River; the Province of Carolina, then the southernmost of the English colonies, was so far winning this race, having established a lucrative trade network touching the banks of the Mississippi. Pierre Le Moyne d Iberville, a French explorer and trader, was eager to break up this Carolinian trade network. At the start of the war, he went to Spanish Florida and urged the pro-Bourbon commander of Pensacola to arm the local Apalachee natives and send them into Carolina to wreak havoc. This was done and, in August 1702, a Spanish-led Apalachee war party began raiding the trading posts of the Carolina backcountry. The English quickly put together an army of their own to meet this threat and fought the Spanish and Apalachee at the Battle of Flint River in October 1702. The battle was a resounding English victory; 500 Apalachee warriors were killed or wounded, the rest forced back into Spanish Florida. Remove Ads  Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville Unknown Artist (Public Domain) James Moore, the governor of Carolina, was not about to let them get away so easily. That autumn, he raised a force of 500 English militia and 300 Indigenous allies   mostly Muscogee   and personally led them in an invasion of Spanish Florida. On 10 November 1702, Moore laid siege to St. Augustine, burning the outlying Spanish communities. For over a month, the English continued to lay siege, but their guns had little impact on the strong walls of St. Augustine. When a Spanish relief force arrived from Havana on 29 December, Moore lifted the siege and pulled his forces back to Charles Town (Charleston). The following year, he led 50 English militia and over 1,000 allied Muscogee warriors back into Florida, burning the Spanish missions to the west of St. Augustine. This campaign of retribution climaxed in January 1704, when Moore s men conducted a series of raids against the Apalachee villages. Moore himself would later claim to have killed over 1,100 Apalachee men, women, and children, and to have forced another 4,300 into slavery. Many of the survivors were forced onto reservations along the Savannah River. In 1706, the French and Spanish retaliated with a joint attack on Charles Town, although this ultimately failed. The next several years saw this cycle of retaliatory raids continue between the Spanish in Florida and the English in Carolina. War in New England To the north, the series of bloody border raids that had characterized King William s War resumed with a new fury. In early 1703, a French-led force of 500 Wabanaki warriors moved down from Acadia and burned several English settlements in Maine including Wells and Falmouth (present-day Portland). English settlers who had survived the bloodshed of the previous decade must have looked on in horror as their rebuilt settlements went up in flames, their family members slaughtered or carried off to Canada as captives. Indeed, during the French and Wabanaki raids of 1703, over 300 English settlers were either killed or taken captive. But the most infamous raid of the war would occur the following year, when a French military officer, Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville, led a band of 250 Abenaki and Caughnawaga warriors to the sleepy town of Deerfield, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. At 4 am on 29 February 1704, they silently crept across the outlying snow-covered fields, entered the undefended town, and proceeded to rip the English colonists from their beds. 47 men, women, and children were killed outright, while 112 others were rounded up and taken as captives. These captives were dragged over 300 miles to the French settlement of Montreal, some of them dying enroute. The survivors were either assimilated into the Abenaki tribe   a custom practiced by some Native American nations to replace losses to their communities   or ransomed back to Massachusetts. In 1704, the English retaliated to these raids by sending an expedition of their own into Acadia. This was led by Colonel Benjamin Church, a renowned Indigenous fighter who had won fame in the bloody battles of both King Philip s War and King William s War. Church raided several Acadian settlements, repaying the French and Wabanakis with fire and blood. Some accounts claim that Church made an attempt to attack Port Royal, the capital of Acadia, but found it too well defended and gave up, returning to New Hampshire. In 1705, the French and their Wabanaki allies made new raids into northern Massachusetts. They were quick with their bloody business and were oftentimes long gone before the local militia could mount any kind of defense. Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley soon realized that the best way to defend his colony was to launch an offensive into New France. In May 1707, he organized a 1,600-man expedition to seize Port Royal. Like Church before them, these New England troops found Port Royal s defenses too strong and were repulsed after a brief siege. By now, it had become clear that the New Englanders needed help if they were to turn the tide against the French and Wabanaki raids. Such help would have to come from the dormant Iroquois Confederacy, still neutral and licking its wounds from the last war. Remove Ads  English Raid on Grand Pre, 1704 Hezekiah Butterwort (Public Domain) But indeed, most of the Iroquois were in no mood to help. Except for the Mohawks, the most Anglophile of the confederacy s Five Nations, the Iroquois were mistrustful of the English, remembering how they had betrayed them at the end of the last war. In fact, some of the Iroquois, particularly the Onondaga and upper Seneca nations, were beginning to favor forging stronger ties with the French, and had allowed French Jesuit missionaries amongst their communities. Alarmed, the Province of New York sent its Indian commissioner, Peter Schuyler, to remind the Iroquois of their old alliance with the English, known as the Covenant Chain, and to draw them back into the fold. After multiple meetings, the Iroquois still refused to offer full military support, though they soothed Schuyler with vague promises of help. In the meantime, some Iroquois provided the French with word of Schuyler s attempts to invoke the Covenant Chain as well as the English military plans he had shown them   by playing both sides, the Iroquois proved once again that they were shrewd political operators, ensuring their own survival by making sure that both of the European powers relied on them. But while Schuyler attempted to get help from the Iroquois, other colonials were looking for support from across the ocean, in the person of Queen Anne herself. Attacks on Canada In 1708, Samuel Vetch, a Scottish merchant with colonial ties, planned a two-pronged offensive to capture Quebec, the capital of New France. Time and again, Vetch had witnessed the French grant sanctuary to the Wabanakis after their destructive raids on English settlements, leading him to the conclusion that the only way to ensure New England s security was to expel the French from North America altogether. To this end, he travelled to London and appealed to Queen Anne herself for military support from Great Britain (England was merged into Great Britain with the Acts of Union in 1707). The queen approved of Vetch s  grand enterprise  and offered to provide ships for his campaign. The next year, Vetch and his collaborator, colonial official Francis Nicholson, put together their expedition: one army of 1,500 men would march overland to capture Montreal while another 1,000-man force would sail to Quebec aboard British ships. This ambitious campaign, however, had to be called off when the promised British ships never materialized; indeed, they had been rerouted for military operations off Portugal. Frustratingly, the North American theater had proved to be nothing more than a sideshow for the generals of Europe. The two men refused to give up. In early 1710, they returned to London, this time in the company of four Indigenous chiefs, three of whom were Iroquois from the pro-English Mohawk nation. The presence of these so-called  Four Mohawk Kings  caused a great sensation in London. The chiefs were carried through the streets in royal carriages, banqueted by the Board of Trade, and even treated to a performance of William Shakespeare's Macbeth where they were allowed to sit on stage. When the Indigenous chiefs were granted an audience with the queen, they asked for military assistance against the French, as well as Anglican missionaries to go amongst their villages and offset the influence of the Jesuits. This move, calculated by Nicholson and Vetch, made it difficult for the queen to refuse. So, in July 1710, Nicholson returned to Boston with 400 marines brought over from Britain. He recruited 1,500 militiamen from the colonies and, in late September, set sail aboard a fleet consisting of 36 transports and 5 British warships. The British and colonists arrived outside Port Royal and captured it on 13 October after a week-long siege. Nicholson s forces promptly occupied it and renamed it Annapolis Royal in honor of the queen. Remove Ads  Four Mohawk Kings Contingent Identity (CC BY-SA) Emboldened by this success, Nicholson returned to London in 1711 to ask for support for another offensive against Quebec. This was granted and, in June, a fleet of 15 ships-of-the-line arrived in Boston under Admiral Hovenden Walker, transporting 5,000 British soldiers. This was, up to that point, the largest military force that Britain had ever offered in support of its North American colonies. The expedition had to set off quickly   the then small town of Boston could barely afford to feed this influx of mouths   and sailed for Quebec at the end of July. But, as the fleet approached the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, it sailed into a thick fog. Several ships were wrecked on the rocky shores and sank, with as many as 700 soldiers drowning. After this calamity, Admiral Walker had no choice but to call off the expedition. Nicholson, meanwhile, was leading a concurrent overland expedition to capture Montreal which included some Iroquois scouts. However, once he learned of Walker s failure, he promptly called off his expedition and turned back to Albany, New York. Peace In 1712, an armistice was reached between Britain and France, and a final peace treaty was signed the following year. In the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Philip V   the Bourbon candidate   was recognized as king of Spain, in return for his renunciation of all claims to the French throne. But where Britain really gained the most was in North America; France ceded control of Acadia, Newfoundland, the Hudson Bay area, and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts to Britain. In return, the French kept control of  le-Royale (modern-day Cape Breton Island) and retained the right to fish off the coast of Newfoundland. The Treaty of Utrecht did not provide for the Wabanakis, who made a separate peace with the New England colonies in July 1713. In the ensuing Treaty of Portsmouth, the Wabanakis and New Englanders established a boundary at the Kennebec River   thereby resolving the long-running border dispute in Maine   and the Wabanakis allowed the colonists to establish trading posts in their territory. Thus, Queen Anne s War was over. Unlike King William s War, which had achieved nothing and restored the prewar status quo, Queen Anne s War ended in a British victory, shoring up the British presence in modern-day Canada at the expense of the French. Indeed, the French, wary of losing their remaining Canadian territories, spent the following years building a mighty fortress on Cape Breton Island that they named Louisbourg; this would serve as a major point of contention between the French and the British, raising tensions in the region. In the former French colony of Acadia   renamed Nova Scotia by the British   many Acadians refused to swear allegiance to the British Crown and left for other French controlled colonies. The Iroquois had retained their neutrality during the course of the war. However, in the Treaty of Utrecht, they had been recognized as British subjects, aligning them further with the British colonies, whether they wanted to or not. Though the colonial map of North America had changed, animosities between all the major players remained as strong as ever, leading to the third great colonial conflict King George s War (1744-1748).",

        "content": "French and Wabanakis Attack Schenectady, 1690 Unknown Artist (Public Domain) King William s War (1688-1697) was the first of four major colonial conflicts fought between England, France, and their respective Native American allies in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though the war had its own unique origins, it coincided with a larger European conflict   the Nine Years  War   marking the first time that Colonial America was swept up in the imperial struggles of the Old World. Though the war was named after King William III of England (reign 1689-1702), it had more to do with the political situation in North America than with the grand designs of European kings. Tensions between the New England colonies and the indigenous Wabanaki Confederacy remained high in the aftermath of King Philip s War (1675-1678). Mistrustful of the intentions of the English, the Wabanaki aligned themselves with New France, the other major colonial power in the region. The French, in turn, were concerned with protecting their lucrative fur trade from the machinations of the powerful Iroquois Confederacy, who were allied with the English in New York. Once word arrived from across the ocean that England and France were at war, the North American powder keg exploded; for the next several years, the French and Wabanaki launched several bloody raids against the English and Iroquois, who responded in kind. The backwoods bloodshed would continue until 1697, when the Treaty of Ryswick ended most of the fighting and restored the prewar borders. Tensions would continue to simmer until the outbreak of the next great colonial conflict, Queen Anne s War (1702-1713). Remove Ads  Background In the decade that followed the devastation of King Philip s War, an uneasy peace settled over New England. The peace, though fragile, was certainly welcome, since the war that preceded it had been bitter and hard-fought. The Wampanoag Confederacy, once the dominant power in the region, had attacked the New England colonies in a desperate bit to stop the white settlers from encroaching onto their lands. Thousands of men, women, and children had died in the struggle that followed, dozens of villages, both indigenous and English, razed to the ground. But now, Metacomet   the Wampanoag chieftain who had started the war, known to the English as  King Philip    was dead, felled by an assassin s bullet, his severed head adorning a pike at the entrance to Plymouth, Massachusetts, where it would molder for the next two decades. His followers, those who had not already been killed, were either rounded up and executed or sold into slavery, while the other Wampanoags were forced onto reservations and made to watch as the triumphant New Englanders gobbled up their ancestral lands. The balance of power in the northeast had forever shifted; the strength of the Wampanoag Confederacy had been broken, the hegemony of the English ascendent. The Wabanakis, cognizant of the way the English had treated the Wampanoags, remained wary. But no sooner had the bloodshed of King Philip s War given way to peace then Increase Mather, the preeminent minister in Boston, predicted the coming of another conflict:  There seems to be a dark cloud rising from the east in respect of Indians in those parts; yea, a cloud which streameth forth in blood  (quoted in Pulsipher, 588). Indeed, the Wampanoags had not been the only Native Americans contending with the English for control of the northeast. In the French colony of Acadia   roughly corresponding to the modern-day Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick   lived the Wabanaki people, or  people of the Dawnland . During King Philip s War, the Wabanakis had raided English settlements in New Hampshire and Maine, wreaking such havoc as to completely drive the terrified Englishmen away. In 1678, the war weary governments of New England signed a peace treaty with the Wabanakis. The Wabanakis would agree to let the English return to their abandoned settlements, and, in exchange, the English would recognize Wabanaki sovereignty and pay them an annual tribute in corn. For a while, this peace seemed to hold although the Wabanakis, cognizant of the way the English had treated the Wampanoags, remained wary. Remove Ads  Sir Edmund Andros Mary Beale (Public Domain) To better prepare themselves for the eventuality of an English betrayal, the five Wabanaki nations (Abenaki, Mi kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot) organized themselves into the Wabanaki Confederacy. They also pursued closer relations with New France, intermarrying with French settlers and allowing Jesuit missionaries into their midst. The French, of course, were the other dominant European presence in the region, vying with the English for control of the lucrative fur trade. Although the French were less permanently established in North America than their English rivals   in 1689, for instance, New France had a population of only 14,000, compared to the 154,000 people living in the English colonies   they were able to maintain their grip on the fur trade through a web of strong alliances with local Native American groups, like the Wabanaki. But in 1680, the string of alliances that upheld the French fur trade came under threat when the powerful Iroquois Confederacy attacked several of New France s indigenous allies in the Great Lakes region. The Iroquois had recently formed an alliance with the English government of New York, called the Covenant Chain, leading the French to suspect that they had acted with the blessing   if not by the direct instigation   of the English. In retaliation, the French raided several Iroquois villages in New York, thereby challenging both the Iroquois and the English. The stage was set for another conflict; the clouds of war, as foreseen by Increase Mather, looked quite dark indeed. In early 1689, monumental events in Europe would once again affect the destiny of the New World. First Blood In April 1688, amidst all this escalating violence, Sir Edmund Andros led an expedition to Saint-Castin s Trading House in Maine. Andros was the unpopular governor of the Dominion of New England, a short-lived conglomeration of the New England colonies under a single, royally appointed government. An authoritative man, Andros sought to flex his powers by resolving a border dispute between Maine and Acadia. He led his soldiers to Penobscot Bay where they plundered both the home and trading post of Baron Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin, a French military officer and trader who had set up shop on land claimed by Andros. Saint-Castin, who had married a Penobscot woman and had mixed-race sons by her, was well respected in the Wabanaki Confederacy; the attack on his property was viewed as an insult to the Wabanaki as a whole. Around the same time, 16 Wabanaki men were arrested in Maine on the orders of Governor Andros on the pretense that they had killed English cattle, and were sent to Boston for imprisonment. Wabanaki patience with their English neighbors had already been running thin   the New Englanders had slowly been violating the 1678 treaty by settling on Wabanaki lands and stopping payment of the corn tribute   but these two incidents were the final straw. Remove Ads  In August 1688, Saint-Castin led a party of Wabanaki warriors on raids against several English settlements in Maine. A few English settlers were killed in these scuffles, and several more were taken captive. When he learned of these raids, Governor Andros realized that he may have accidentally started a new Indian war and tried to deescalate, ordering the release of the 16 Wabanaki prisoners in Boston. But when Saint-Castin refused to release his own prisoners, Andros shifted tactics and led an army of 700 men into Maine in early November. By then, Saint-Castin and the Wabanakis had already withdrawn into Acadia, and the New Englanders accomplished little besides simply tramping around the wilderness. At the end of the year, Andros returned to Boston but left his troops behind in Maine to keep the peace, stationing them in several frontier posts. But, the following spring, news arrived from Europe that would change everything   the Glorious Revolution had broken out in England. King James II of England had been forced to abdicate, leading to the ascension of William of Orange and his wife Mary to the joint rule of the kingdom. The shockwaves of revolution reverberated throughout the colonies; Andros was overthrown by a mob in Boston, and the Dominion of New England dismantled. Because of the chaos, most of the English soldiers returned to Massachusetts, leaving Maine once again undefended. Benjamin Church, c. 1675 Unknown Artist (Public Domain) Three Raids In early 1689, monumental events in Europe would once again affect the destiny of the New World. The newly crowned William III of England joined together with Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, to form a  Grand Alliance  against the expansionist ambitions of King Louis XIV of France. In May, William and Leopold officially declared war on France, beginning a conflict that would become known as the Nine Years  War. Though the kings and generals of Europe hardly paid any thought to the backwoods of North America half a world away, this official declaration of war gave the colonies leave to attack one another with renewed vigor. News of the expanded European conflict had not yet reached the little settlement of Dover, New Hampshire, when, on the night of 27 June 1689, a pair of Wabanaki women arrived and asked for shelter. This was granted and, in the middle of the night, the women threw open the town gates to let in scores of Wabanaki warriors. 20 English settlers were massacred that night, including Major Richard Waldron, the town s leading citizen. During King Philip s War, Waldron had used trickery to capture hundreds of Wabanakis before selling them into slavery. Eager to repay this debt, the Wabanaki warriors now burst into his bedroom, clubbed him over the head, and dragged him into the next room where they tied him to a chair and tortured him to death. The Wabanakis then absconded from the ruined settlement with 29 English prisoners, who were sold into captivity in New France. In August 1689, Saint-Castin once again invaded Maine at the head of a Wabanaki war party, this time sharing command with the French missionary Father Louis-Pierre Thury. They surrounded the English fort at Pemaquid, capturing or killing any English settlers who failed to make it to the safety of the fort s palisades in time. The garrison held out for a day but, after sustaining heavy casualties, opted to surrender; Saint-Castin had both the fort and the nearby town burned to the ground. The raids on Dover and Pemaquid were a clear escalation of hostilities and, after the declaration of war in Europe became known, the English were eager to retaliate. A 1,500-man Iroquois war party was sent into New France to raid the settlement of Lachine, while Major Benjamin Church led 250 Massachusetts soldiers on an expedition to defend English settlers in Maine. Church held a fearsome reputation as an Indian fighter and, indeed, had led the party that had hunted down and killed Metacomet back in 1676. On 21 September 1689, Church would once again make a name for himself, when his men defended the English settlers at Falmouth (present-day Portland, Maine) against a larger Acadian and Wabanaki force. Church beat back the enemy at the cost of 21 casualties, saving the Falmouth settlers from likely slaughter. Remove Ads  Death of Major Richard Waldron Unknown Artist (Public Domain) Escalations In early 1690, the scale of the conflict expanded once again. The governor-general of New France, Louis de Baude, Comte de Frontenac, ordered several concurrent military expeditions against the English colonies. The first expedition, led by French officers and consisting of Wabanaki warriors, made its way to Schenectady, New York, on the night of 8 February 1690. Finding the town undefended, they attacked, massacring 60 residents (including 11 enslaved African Americans) and absconding with 27 captives. The second expedition, led by Saint-Castin, razed the town of Salmon Falls, on the border between New Hampshire and Maine, on 27 March, killing 34 English settlers. Saint-Castin s expedition then wound its way into Maine, falling upon the Falmouth settlement that Church had defended the year before. This time, there was no one to protect the English settlers; Saint-Castin butchered the men, took the women and children prisoner, and burned the settlement to the ground. Church learned of the attack too late and arrived at Falmouth with little to do but bury the dead. Frontenac s attacks did not long go unanswered. On 23 April 1690, seven English warships sailed out of Boston carrying 736 provincial militiamen under Sir William Phips, a Maine-borne treasure hunter who now sought the glory of a military victory. On 9 May, the New Englanders arrived outside Port Royal, the capital of Acadia, taking the 90-man French garrison by surprise. Realizing they could not withstand a siege, the French surrendered. Phips imprisoned the French soldiers and Acadian townspeople in the church before turning a blind eye as his soldiers plundered the town, on the pretext that the French had somehow violated the terms of surrender. Phips left soon after, but additional English warships returned to Port Royal the following month, leading to another round of burning and looting. In September, Church led a second expedition of 300 men into Acadia. He travelled up the Androscoggin River, raiding Wabanaki villages and butchering several of their men. After freeing five English captives from a Wabanaki wigwam, Church claimed victory and returned to New Hampshire. Count Frontenac with Indigenous Allies Charles William Jefferys (Public Domain) Emboldened by these successes, the English decided to launch full-scale invasions of New France. One expedition, under Fitz-John Winthrop, set out overland toward Montreal. However, disease, lack of provisions, and disagreements among officers forced this army to turn back before it reached its target. The second expedition, under Phips, targeted Quebec, capital of New France. In late August, Phips sailed out of Boston with 2,300 militiamen aboard 32 ships. But thanks to poor weather, he did not make it to Quebec until 16 October. Frontenac, appraised of Phips s coming, had had ample time to prepare, and had gathered 3,000 soldiers for the town s defense, including three battalions of colonial regulars. When Phips sent an emissary to demand Frontenac s surrender, the French governor-general felt confident enough to say:  I have no reply to make to your general other than from the mouths of my cannons and muskets  (Canadian Biography). Phips was up to the challenge. On 18 October, he landed his men four miles below Quebec, but they had no sooner begun their march toward the town then they came under fire from French militia and their Wabanaki allies, sheltering in the dense forest. The next day, Phips s warships opened a cannonade against the town but ran out of ammunition quicker than expected. The New England militiamen, already battered from their skirmishes in the woods, refused to assault Quebec without artillery support, forcing Phips to call off the attack. On 23 October, he negotiated a prisoner exchange with Frontenac before loading his men back on the ships and setting sail for Boston. Remove Ads  The War Rages On For the next several years, the cycle of retaliatory raids continued. In 1691, a Wabanaki war party raided the town of Wells in Maine, before travelling to the coastline, boarding an English vessel, and slaughtering its crew. On 24 January 1692, Father Louis-Pierre Thury and Penobscot Chief Madockawando led 300 Acadians and Wabanakis to the town of York   that night, they slaughtered over 100 English settlers and took 80 captives, in an event known as the Candlemas Massacre. Such surprise attacks caused a wave of fear to spread throughout the English colonies, as every frontier settlement wondered if it would be the next to suffer the French and Wabanaki wrath; some scholars speculate that this hysteria helped fuel the infamous Salem Witch Trials of 1692-93. The English responded to these raids in kind. Church led a third expedition into Acadia in 1692, burning and pillaging as he went, and the following year, English frigates returned to Port Royal to burn it for a third time. Battle of Quebec in 1690 Charles Van Tenac (Public Domain) In 1693, tired of the fighting, English officials in Boston entered peace negotiations with the Abenaki, part of the Wabanaki Confederacy. Frontenac, wishing to disrupt such negotiations, sent one of his officers, Claude-S bastian de Villieu, to stir up trouble. Villieu travelled from village to village, recruiting Abenakis that were against the peace treaty and, on 18 July 1694, led 250 of them in an attack on Durham, New Hampshire. In the ensuing slaughter   known afterward as the Oyster River massacre   104 English settlers were killed, 27 taken captive. Villieu killed the livestock and burned the crops, manufacturing a famine for the survivors. The war then settled into a lull until 1696, when the French launched a largescale attack on Iroquois towns in New York and Saint-Castin led a raid on the rebuilt English fort of Pemaquid. After successfully taking the fort, Saint-Castin went on to raze nearly every English settlement in Newfoundland, resulting in over 100 deaths. Church once again retaliated by launching his fourth and final expedition into Acadia. End of the War On 30 October 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick was signed in Europe, ending the Nine Years  War and   by extension   ending King William s War as well. Among other things, the treaty stipulated that New France, New England, and New York would all return to their prewar boundaries, thereby leaving several border disputes   like the one between Acadia and Maine   unresolved. Though England and France were now formally at peace, scattered fighting between the English and Wabanaki continued until January 1699, when the two parties signed a treaty in Casco Bay, Maine. The Iroquois, likewise, remained at war with the French. Frontenac, looking to get revenge on the Iroquois for their raids into New France, launched several devastating attacks on Iroquois villages in the late 1690s. The Iroquois appealed to their allies in New York for help but the English, tired of fighting, remained indifferent. It was not until 1701 that the Iroquois finally made peace with the French. The end of the war did nothing to resolve the high tensions in North America. Indeed, these tensions would soon spill over into the second great colonial conflict of the era, Queen Anne s War.",

        "content": "Balnuaran of Clava Dave Conner (CC BY-NC-SA) Clava Cairns is an early Bronze Age site in Scotland, located east of the city of Inverness, consisting of three well-preserved cairns (two of which are passage graves) and a number of free-standing stones strategically placed for astronomical purposes. The full name of the site is the Prehistoric Burial Cairns of the Balnuaran of Clava which is usually shortened to The Balnuaran of Clava and, informally, Clava Cairns. Although formerly classified as a Neolithic Period site, in 2000 Professor Richard Bradley conclusively proved it was constructed in the Bronze Age and, since the publication of his work, similarities between the monuments at Clava Cairns and other Bronze Age sites have been increasingly noted. Remove Ads  Clava Cairns has become increasingly popular since the publication of the Outlander books (and later TV series) by Diana Gabaldon as many have claimed that the site inspired her first work. Gabaldon, however, has denied this, noting that she had not yet visited Scotland and knew nothing of Clava Cairns when she wrote the first book. Date & Name The cairns date from circa 2500 BCE, but the location is thought to have been in use much earlier, and later additions date to circa 2000 BCE. The site was in continual use for over 1000 years and evidence suggests reuse by communities, intermittently, until 770 as a burial ground and center for rituals. The cairns themselves have been identified as graves but were clearly constructed with astronomical alignments in mind. Scholars Alwyn and Brinley Rees define the meaning of a cairn: Remove Ads  A cairn is a mound of stones erected over a burial or at some other point with other-world associations, such as wherever a man has died out-of-doors or where a coffin has rested. (188) Even so, a cairn may also represent wholeness and specifically the whole of a country, of a collective people, such as those in Ireland or Scotland, which both have a significant number of cairns throughout. The scholars Rees discuss the significance of the cairns of Ireland: Every beehive tomb in Greece is a symbol of the omphalos ('navel' of the earth); every stupa (gravemound) in India is a miniature of Mount Meru in the middle of the world. In Yorubaland, [the ethnologist] Leo Frobenius found little clay cult objects which consisted of a central cone, representing the god of world order, with four smaller cones around it representing the gods of the cardinal points. Similarly, every cairn in Ireland represents the whole. (187-188) In this same way, it is thought, Clava Cairns represented Scotland as a whole but, more importantly, Scotland's specific place in the universe. According to Andis Kaulins of Megaliths.net, 'Bal' meant 'Pole' and 'Nuaran' 'River of Light', thus linking the site to the Milky Way and designating Balnuaran as the center of the heavens from which the ancients could chart the stars. Remove Ads  Clava Cairns, Scotland Holly Hayes (CC BY-NC-SA) This may well be, and the site certainly has astronomical significance, but researcher-writer London Crotty of the University of North Carolina Greensboro, offers a simpler and more grounded definition of Balnuaran as \"Home of the Nairn\" noting how \"Bal\" (the anglicized version of Scottish Gaelic baile) means \"village\" or \"home\" while \"Narann\" (also given as \"Nuaran\") is the Scottish Gaelic for \"Nairn\", as in the River Nairn that flows past the site (personal email, October 2025). This definition still suggests Clava Cairns as a \"pole\"   a notable spot   on a river that is part of the lives of Scottish communities for 35 miles (56 km), linking the site to the greater whole. There are 45 other cairns in the Inverness-Nairn valley which form a definite pattern corresponding to the planets, but this particular site seems to have a special resonance with the people as evidenced by the construction of the cairns in their original state, which differs from other sites on a grander scale. it was once not only an astronomical observatory but also a burial ground for the most prestigious members of the local community. Scholarship on the site agrees that it was once not only an astronomical observatory but also a burial ground for the most prestigious members of the local community. It is evident that the cairns were constructed to honor the dead but, at the same time, to mark the passing of the seasons and provide people with a means of regulating a calendar. Remove Ads  The passage graves are aligned to the winter solstice and the standing stones, likewise, serve astronomical purposes. At the same time, however, the monuments may have served a spiritual/religious purpose as physical evidence of their original lavish construction and ring-and-cup marks on the stones suggests. The Cairns at Clava Excavations at the site began in 1828 and continued, at intervals, through the 1990's. The most recent, and extensive, work has been done by Professor Richard Bradley whose work The Good Stones: A New Investigation of the Clava Cairns maintains that the location of the cairns was not only essential to astronomical observations but also to communication between different communities in different regions. The site is located at the northeastern end of the Great Glen of the Highlands of Scotland which people used   and still do today   in traveling from the north of Scotland to the south and west. Clava Cairns, then, could have served as some central meeting place which clans far to the south could have easily located; all they would have to do would be to follow the Great Glen north to the \"Home of the Nairn.\" Remove Ads  The cairns at the site have been designated the North-East Cairn, Central Cairn, and South-West Cairn. It is thought that there were at least two other cairns at the site which are no longer extant. The North-East and South-West Cairns are both passage graves with entrances built leading to a circular center. The Central Cairn completely encloses the circular space inside, and it is thought that bodies may have been cremated here based on finds in the 1950's which uncovered cremated bone and evidence of recurring fires. There is a fourth, poorly preserved, structure at the site known as the Kerb Cairn which, today, is only a circle of stones near to the Central Cairn. The 1950's excavations designated this stone ring a gravesite, though no human remains were uncovered, based on the similarity of construction to the nearby ancient cemetery of Milton of Clava. All three cairns are surrounded by upright, slender, standing stones of slightly different color. While these upright stones bear no symbols, some of the stones which make up the cairns are inscribed with ring-and-cup marks. Examples of the mysterious circles carved in stones have been found all over the United Kingdom and beyond. No one knows what the circles symbolized to the ancient carvers, but it appears the petroglyphs were wrought using stone tools or deer antlers. It is possible   even likely   that the ring-and-cup marks symbolize an unknown tripartite deity or the Triple-Goddess of the Maiden-Matron-Crone who appear in a number of locales throughout the Celtic world. The marks might also suggest the journey through life as symbolized by the spiral which would mirror the construction of the passage graves as a kind of labyrinth. Bradley's Excavations The North-East and South-West passage graves, excavated by Professor Bradley in the 1990's, along with the rest of the site, exemplify these engravings, but whether these were carved into the stones before they were in place or after is unknown. Professor Bradley concluded that the entire site was originally constructed during a single phase, but this only means that the stones and the cairns were erected at once, and it sheds no light on whether the ring-and-cup marks were engraved before or after the stones were set in place. Digs at the site have revealed bone fragments indicating that this site, like others, was most certainly a burial ground. Bradley reports: Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! A few flecks of cremated bone were found on the surface of the platform [of the north-east cairn and] over a hundred lithic artifacts were recovered during the excavation and samples were taken for study by soil micromorphology, pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating. (Bradley, 1, Historic Environment Record) It appears, however, that it served as a final resting place for a very select few and was not a cemetery for the common people. No complete skeletal remains have been recovered from the site, and it is probable that only one person was buried in each of the cairns or, perhaps, only a single person at the entire site. The Balnuaran of Clava (Clava Cairns) Dave Conner (CC BY-NC-SA) It has been speculated, based on the amount of quartz found in proximity to the cairns, that they were once adorned with the white stone which would have caused them to almost glow and this suggests the importance of the site to ancient people. Professor Bradley has shown that stone rubble was used to initially help hold the larger stones of the cairns in place and that this rubble then extended outwards toward the eleven monoliths which surround the site. These smaller rocks and gravel, after the stones of the cairns were fully situated, were then spread to form an even platform between the structures and the monoliths so that, taken together with the quartz-covered cairns, the site would have been most impressive. Astronomical Significance Professor Alexander Thom conclusively showed, in the 1940's,, that the entranceways of the passage graves align directly and, in correspondence with the standing stones, point to the winter sun's setting position. The cairns are now all open to the sky and rise to a height of about five feet (1.5 m) but evidence suggests that they were once much higher than the ruins one sees today, probably at least ten feet (3 m) tall, and that the inner chamber of each cairn was enclosed by a roof. On the winter solstice, sunlight beams directly into the chambers of the passage graves, illuminating the rooms which would have been in darkness the rest of the year. Regarding this, Historic Scotland observes: Remove Ads  The [North-East Cairn] is aligned on the midwinter solstice. In recent years this phenomenon has been observed by covering the chamber and passage with tarpaulin. This showed that on a clear day the rays of the setting sun travel down the passage and divide the chamber in half. A beam of intense light focuses on the back wall. The same effect would have been visible in the south-west cairn where the view is obstructed by a modern farmhouse. (Historic Scotland.gov.uk) The midwinter solstice is recognized as a matter of considerable importance to the ancients as so many early structures are found aligned to it (such as the famous site of Maeshowe in Orkney, Scotland, and Newgrange in Ireland, to name only two). As with more famous locations, the cairns at Clava are situated so precisely that, when considered in a pattern with other sites nearby, an astronomical purpose is very clearly suggested. Scholars John and Julia Keay write: It has been noted that a line through the passages of the two passage graves points exactly to a spot on the horizon corresponding to the midwinter sunset. This is unlikely to be fortuitous, although the significance and meaning of the alignment is a matter of controversy. It also appears that the cairns and their surrounding stone circles are laid out with complex geometrical accuracy, suggesting a knowledge of practical mathematics and astronomy. (165) Clava Cairns Panorama Bettany Weeks (CC BY-NC-ND) The  controversy  the Keays allude to is the interpretation of the site by visitors in the modern day who often conclude, skeptically, that the cairns are simply mounds of stones farmers cleared from their fields and piled in heaps. This interpretation is untenable when one considers the precision with which the cairns are constructed, their astronomical alignment, and the physical evidence of long use of the site as ritually significant. Further, as has been noted, the cairns at Clava form a discernible pattern with other monuments in the area but were constructed on a grander scale, which makes clear that this site was significantly more important than the others. The Keays note: Other cairns of this type in the Inverness area suggest a regional Bronze Age culture which built its burial cairns to a slightly different pattern to other regions of Scotland. The Clava type is very distinctive, although it incorporates the same elements   burial chamber, passages, kerbs   found elsewhere. (165) The distinctive nature of the cairns at Clava no doubt had a specific meaning but what the meaning might be is unknown. It is certain, however, that these cairns   as others throughout Scotland, Ireland, Britain, and elsewhere   were constructed as monuments intimately connected to memory. Memory & the Cairns of Clava From ancient times to the present day, people keep the past alive through remembrance. Ancient Mesopotamian tombs were inscribed with the name and deeds of the deceased just as they were in Egypt, China, Greece, Rome, and elsewhere. In ancient Greece, in fact, the remembrance of the dead ensured their survival in the afterlife, and in Egypt, tomb offerings were made daily for the sustenance of the departed. In China, tomb-sweeping day   in which one visits and tends to the graves of one's relatives   has been observed for centuries and continues to be in the present day. It is probable, then, whatever other uses Clava Cairns served, it was a place of remembrance. The astronomical positioning of the graves and standing stones would not have taken away from the aspect of those structures as memorials either to an individual, a group, an event, or a reminder of the essential nature of life as change and one's eternal journey after death. Scholar Rodney Castleden writes: Long memories are characteristic of Celtic communities. The Druids leaned totally on memory. They had to devote themselves to great efforts of learning. Julius Caesar noted that the Druids  are said to learn by heart a great number of verses.  They went so far as to spurn writing in order to intensify their dependence on memory. In Druidry there is a deep and abiding connection between memory and nature. The earth itself is regarded as remembering everything; it is a witness to history in a way that we cannot fully appreciate. (447) Anyone who has spent any time in Ireland or Scotland is aware of the power and strength of the Celtic memory. Along these lines, the cairns would have served as memorials; although what exactly they were memorializing remains uncertain. The ring-and-cup marks at the site continue to defy efforts at interpretation   as they do elsewhere   but could signify the mystical concept of the Rule of Three in which  multiplying an image was a simple way of emphasizing it  and  the most common way of doing this was to multiply an image by three  (Castleden, 459). Deities are frequently represented in Celtic iconography in three's   as they are elsewhere   but the ring-and-cup marks might also represent individuals or, placed as they are at Clava Cairns, the spiral concept of the labyrinth. Remove Ads  Panorama of The Balnuaran of Clava Cairns Joshua J. Mark (CC BY) Conclusion Labyrinths, whether in ancient Egypt or Greece, were associated with the dead and one's journey through the afterlife but are also associated with one's life prior to death and one's journey to wholeness. The choices one makes inside a labyrinth either confuse and lead to frustration and loss or strengthen and lead to completion and fulfillment. Castleden observes that  the spiral is the simplest form of labyrinth, one in which no choices are presented beyond the choice to travel. It is a single path, a path to the center and back  (467). The passage graves at Clava Cairns certainly present one with only this one choice and the ring-and-cup marks could have been carved to emphasize the cyclical nature of life so inherent in Celtic mythology and lore. In this view, nothing and no one ever dies; all things merely change and become something else. The seemingly linear path one travels between birth and death does not actually begin at birth or end with death; everything that dies comes back in some renewed form or continues on eternally. The cairns at Clava could have been raised to emphasize this understanding as well as commemorate those who had passed on to the next phase of existence on their eternal journey.",

        "content": "Table of Contents Quick Summary Ask the Chatbot a Question Also important to Sri Lanka s cultural development has been its position as the nexus of important maritime trade routes between Europe , the Middle East , and Asia. Long before the European discovery of an oceanic route to India in the 15th century, Sri Lanka was known to Greek, Roman, Persian, Armenian, Arab, Malay, and Chinese sailors. With the coming of the Europeans, however, the strategic importance of Sri Lanka increased, and Western maritime powers fought to control its shores. Both Sri Lanka and India came under European influence and colonial rule. This common experience worked to tighten the long-standing links between the two countries, and, with the attainment of independence in the mid-20th century, Sri Lankan and Indian social institutions and ideologies began to resonate more closely with each other. Despite its obvious affinities with India, Sri Lanka nevertheless developed a unique identity over the ages that ultimately set it apart from its neighbour. Cultural traits brought from India necessarily underwent independent growth and change in Sri Lanka, owing in part to the island s physical separation from the subcontinent. Buddhism, for instance, virtually disappeared from India, but it continued to flourish in Sri Lanka, particularly among the Sinhalese. Moreover, the Sinhalese language , which grew out of Indo-Aryan dialects from the mainland, eventually became indigenous solely to Sri Lanka and developed its own literary tradition. Sri Lanka has had a continuous record of human settlement for more than two millennia, and its civilization has been shaped largely by that of the Indian subcontinent. The island s two major ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and the Tamils , and its two dominant religions, Buddhism and Hinduism , made their way to the island from India , and Indian influence pervaded such diverse fields as art, architecture, literature, music, medicine, and astronomy. history of Sri Lanka , a survey of the notable events and people in the history of Sri Lanka from ancient times to the present day. The country, formerly known as Ceylon, is an island lying in the Indian Ocean and separated from peninsular India by the Palk Strait . Proximity to the Indian subcontinent has facilitated close cultural interaction between Sri Lanka and India from ancient times. At a crossroads of maritime routes traversing the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has also been exposed to cultural influences from other Asian civilizations. Geologically, Sri Lanka is an extension of peninsular India that separated from the mainland perhaps as recently as the Miocene Epoch (roughly 25 to 5 million years ago). Archaeological excavations undertaken since the late 20th century have indicated that the island already supported human inhabitants some 75,000 to 125,000 years ago. The earliest occupants of the region were, like other Paleolithic peoples, hunters and gatherers who made and used fairly rough stone tools. Finer tools made of quartz and occasionally of chert become visible in the archaeological record about 28,000 years ago. The artifacts from this era, which include many microliths (very small, sharp flakes of stone that can be used individually or hafted together to make a serrated edge), have been found throughout the country, especially among the grasslands of the hills and the sandy tracts of the coast. By about the 9th century bce, people had begun to experiment with food production and irrigation and had gained access to some of the iron tools produced on the continent. Early settlement and the spread of Buddhism Sri Lanka s earliest human inhabitants of whom there is direct fossil evidence were hunter-gatherers in the area of Balangoda in the south. Urban settlements first appeared in the 10th century bce near Anuradhapura in north-central Sri Lanka. The ancestors of the Sinhalese, who were speakers of Indo-Aryan languages, migrated from northern India about the 5th century bce. The Tamils were probably later immigrants from areas of central, eastern, and southern India where Dravidian languages were spoken; their early migrations spanned a period from about the 3rd century bce to about 1200 ce. Sri Lanka possesses a historical tradition preserved in written form by Buddhist chroniclers. The earliest of the extant chronicles is the Dipavamsa ( Island s Chronicle ), compiled probably by Buddhist nuns in the 4th century ce. The Dipavamsa was followed by the Mahavamsa ( Great Chronicle ) and its continuation, called the Culavamsa ( Little Chronicle ). Together, these chronicles constitute a literary record of the establishment and growth of Sinhalese political power and of Sri Lankan Buddhism; however, the documents must be used with caution and always in conjunction with archaeological especially epigraphic material.

Legendary origins According to the Sinhalese tradition, as recorded in the Mahavamsa, the first Indian settlers on Sri Lanka were Prince Vijaya and his 700 followers, who landed on the west coast near Puttalam (5th century bce). They had been banished for misconduct from the kingdom of Sinhapura in northern India by Vijaya s father, King Sinhabahu, who put them all in a ship and drove them away. When Vijaya s band landed on the island, it was inhabited by yakshas (a type of spirit; perhaps referring here to human members of a cult of yaksha devotees), whom they defeated and chased into the interior. Vijaya married a yaksha princess and had two children by her. Later he drove her and the children away and sent to the Madurai court in India for a Pandu (probably referring to the Pandya dynasty) princess and for wives for his 700 followers. Vijaya settled down to reign as king after a ceremonial enthronement and marriage and founded a dynasty. He had no heir to the throne, and toward the end of his reign he sent for his younger brother at Sinhapura. The brother, unwilling to leave his native land, sent his youngest son, Panduvasudeva, to Sri Lanka. Panduvasudeva landed with 32 followers at Gokanna (now Trincomalee) on the east coast. He was enthroned at Upatissagama and continued the Vijaya dynasty. Indo-Aryan settlement in Sri Lanka The account of Sri Lanka s settlement as presented in the Mahavamsa contains an element of historical fact the settlers were Indo-Aryan peoples from northern India. However, controversy exists as to the exact provenance of the early settlers; the legends contain evidence pointing to both the northeastern and the northwestern parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Vijaya s ancestors hailed from Bengal, in the northeast, but his father established himself subsequently in Gujarat, the area in northwest India from which the adventurers were put out to sea. Before arriving in Sri Lanka, their ship called at Supara, on the west coast of India. Their landing in Sri Lanka, at Tambapanni, near Puttalam, would indicate their arrival from western India. Some early tribal names occurring in Sri Lanka also suggest connections with northwestern India and the Indus River region. While considerable evidence points to western India as the home of the first immigrants, it seems probable that a subsequent wave arrived from the vicinity of Bengal and Odisha in the northeast. One band of settlers landed in Sri Lanka at the east-coast port of Gokanna, a natural port of disembarkation for vessels arriving from the Bay of Bengal. The traditional accounts of the arrival of Panduvasudeva may portray a second wave of migration following the first mentioned in the Vijaya legend. Linguistic affinities between the early Sinhalese- and Prakrit-speaking peoples of eastern India strengthen the hypothesis of a migration from this area. The tradition speaks primarily of settlement by conquest, and tribes of conquerors led by a warrior nobility would certainly have propelled the Indo-Aryan migration southward. Also important, however, was the pursuit of trade (as opposed to military conquest). Indo-Aryan merchants probably reached Sri Lanka while sailing down the Indian coast, and some of these merchants, motivated by a lucrative trade in Sri Lanka s natural products, may have founded settlements. The view that Indo-Aryan migrants laid the foundations of Sinhalese civilization increasingly has come into question since the late 20th century. Archaeological evidence has indicated that settled agriculture, tank irrigation, use of iron, and pottery were features present before the Indo-Aryan migrations. During the early phases of these migrations, a synthesis seems to have taken place between Indo-Aryan, pre-Indo-Aryan, and possibly Dravidian elements to create the early Sinhalese culture of the Anuradhapura period, which spanned the 3rd century bce to the 10th century ce. The chronicled account of Vijaya s confrontation with the yakshas and the search for consorts in the Pandu kingdom of Madurai (if this may be presumed to be the Pandya Tamil kingdom of southern India) point to such integration. In any case, Indo-Aryan settlements grew in different parts of the island from about the 5th century bce. The settlers came in numerous clans or tribes; the most powerful were the Sinhalese, who eventually gave their name to the descendants of the various groups. The earliest settlers were those on the west-central coast, who pushed inland along the Malwatu River and founded a number of riverbank villages. Their seat of government was Upatissagama. Tradition attributes the founding of the kingdom of Anuradhapura to Pandukkabhaya, the third king of the Vijaya dynasty. With its growth as the strongest Sinhalese kingdom, the city of Anuradhapura and the nearby settlements flourished. Kings built up the city and developed it for urban life as they extended royal control over villages and outlying settlements. With the establishment of strong government, the population grew and the kingdom expanded into the north-central region.",

        "title": "Delhi or Democracy? The Sri Lankan Tamil Dilemma Haunted by History..!",
        "content": "Delhi or Democracy? The Sri Lankan Tamil Dilemma Haunted by History..! -By LeN South Asia Correspondent (Lanka-e-News -04.July.2025, 11.30 PM) Beneath the gentle palm-fringed skyline of Jaffna and the rain-soaked hills of Sri Lanka s tea country, an old question lingers like the morning mist: Why do Tamil politicians still place their faith in New Delhi rather than engage constructively with Colombo? It is a question that ruffles feathers in both capitals   and among the increasingly disillusioned Tamil population of the north and east. For decades, leaders such as M.A. Sumanthiran, a senior Tamil parliamentarian and prominent figure in the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), have looked to India   not Sri Lanka s own institutions   as the saviour of Tamil political aspirations. But with history being what it is, many now ask: Hasn t India already had its say   and its way   with Tamil politics in Sri Lanka? A History Etched in Betrayal To understand today s paradox, one must first revisit the turbulent 1980s. In a move that would permanently reshape Sri Lanka s post-independence history, India   under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi   began training and arming Tamil rebel groups to destabilise Colombo s rule in the north and east. Officially, New Delhi cited its concern for the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Unofficially, the Indian intelligence community viewed Colombo s growing ties with Washington and its flirtation with regional non-alignment as a threat to Indian hegemony in the Indian Ocean. According to former Indian intelligence officials who later spoke on record, the aim was not Tamil liberation   but Tamil leverage.  We didn t want to break Sri Lanka. We wanted to bend it,  said a retired Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) operative during a 2013 academic symposium in Chennai. The results were devastating. Indian-financed militancy fractured the democratic Tamil political movement, radicalised its youth, and transformed grievances into warfare. The armed struggle, led by multiple groups and later dominated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), effectively destroyed the peaceful Tamil federalist movement   and invited catastrophic retaliation. When the Master Turned on the Monster By the late 1980s, India s monster had grown too large to control. The LTTE refused to be a puppet   assassinating rivals, rejecting Indian-imposed settlements, and eventually turning their guns on Indian forces themselves. The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987, signed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J.R. Jayewardene, brought in the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). Ostensibly there to protect Tamil civilians and disarm the rebels, the IPKF ended up embroiled in bitter combat with the LTTE and was accused of extensive civilian atrocities. By the time the IPKF exited in 1990, more than 1,200 Indian soldiers were dead, thousands of Tamil civilians had been killed or maimed, and Sri Lanka s sovereignty had been profoundly violated. Many in the north still speak of the Indian occupation with bitterness   not as peacekeeping, but as punishment. And yet, three decades later, Tamil politicians like Sumanthiran continue to seek Indian support as if 1987 never happened. Sumanthiran and the High Commission Circuit The image is familiar to Colombo s diplomatic watchers: Tamil MPs   mostly from the TNA   making their rounds at the Indian High Commission, attending closed-door meetings, requesting interventions, and issuing statements that echo New Delhi s geopolitical narratives. While such diplomacy is technically within their rights as elected officials, critics see something more troubling   an abdication of local agency.  Why do Tamil leaders still behave as if New Delhi holds the keys to their destiny?  asks Dr. Niranjan Sathasivam, a political science lecturer at the University of Peradeniya.  India has used, discarded, and destroyed the Tamil struggle. It is not a neutral party. And yet, they treat Delhi as both priest and prophet.  Indeed, while the BJP government under Narendra Modi has increased symbolic gestures   cultural exchanges, temple restoration funds, high-level visits   it has offered no serious commitment to constitutional reform, federal devolution, or post-war justice in Sri Lanka. Nor does it appear particularly inclined to do so.  The BJP is not interested in Tamil self-determination. They are interested in countering China and influencing the Sri Lankan political balance,  said a Western diplomat in Colombo. Yet Sumanthiran, a devout Christian, is now seen by some as genuflecting not before his faith, but before Modi s political machinery.  It s as if he s praying to the BJP,  said a Tamil journalist in Jaffna.  He has never once criticised India for their betrayal. Never mentioned the IPKF atrocities. Never acknowledged that India armed our youth only to annihilate them.  Playing the Indian Card   Again Sumanthiran and his allies maintain that Indian involvement remains essential because of Sri Lanka s \"unreliable majoritarianism\". Colombo, they argue, has repeatedly broken promises to the Tamil people   from the aborted Bandaranaike Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 to the stalled 13th Amendment implementation promised under Indian auspices.  We cannot ignore the regional context,  Sumanthiran told local media in April.  India is our closest neighbour and has always played a key role in shaping Sri Lanka s political landscape.  But to many Tamil civil society members, that logic feels outdated   and humiliating.  Do we really want to be begging from the same country that trained child soldiers on our soil and then bombed our villages?  asked a senior activist in Mullaitivu.  Do we have no shame?  Others point to the irony that even today, India publicly insists the solution must come from within Sri Lanka   while Tamil politicians keep flying to Delhi or whispering to Indian envoys in Colombo. The NPP Moment   A Lost Opportunity? In the wake of Sri Lanka s historic economic collapse and the political shift it triggered, the National People s Power (NPP) party   led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake   has emerged as a formidable alternative. The party, with its leftist credentials and anti-corruption stance, has made overtures to Tamil constituencies, offering a new beginning based on equality and decentralisation. Many in the south view the NPP as the first Sinhala-majority party in decades willing to talk seriously about Tamil grievances without racial posturing. Yet, curiously, the Tamil political leadership has remained lukewarm.  They have not even formally sat down with the NPP leadership to explore a framework,  said Prof. Rajan Hoole, a Tamil academic and human rights campaigner.  They are still waiting for Modi.  This hesitation has caused increasing friction with Tamil civil society groups, who are now demanding that the TNA and its allies stop using Indian influence as a shortcut to domestic engagement.  The NPP may not be perfect,  said Rev. Emmanuel Navaratnam, a priest from Kilinochchi.  But they are here. They are willing. They are not the same as the old chauvinist parties. Why are our politicians wasting time in Delhi when they should be in Colombo negotiating real change?  Pawn Politics and Diaspora Discontent For the vast and influential Tamil diaspora   particularly in the UK, Canada, and Australia   this pattern of dependence on India is becoming increasingly unacceptable.  In the 1980s, they asked us to fund the armed struggle. Then we were told to support political engagement. Now they re asking us to trust India again?  said Arun Siva, a Tamil barrister based in London.  We ve been pawns in every geopolitical chess game. Enough is enough.  There is growing pressure within diaspora groups to shift focus back to community rebuilding, economic development, and local political engagement   not proxy games with regional powers. A recent open letter signed by over 70 Tamil professionals worldwide criticised Sri Lankan Tamil MPs for  outsourcing political responsibility to New Delhi  and called for a  homegrown Tamil political movement rooted in accountability and dignity.  The Lasting Damage The costs of this political outsourcing are not abstract. The 30-year war that followed India s meddling cost Sri Lanka trillions in lost economic output, destroyed generations of Tamil youth, and militarised the state in ways that persist to this day. And yet, there has never been a formal Tamil political reckoning with India s role.  There is collective amnesia,  said Dr. Shamara Pathmanathan, a political psychologist.  No memorials for the Tamil civilians killed by the IPKF. No parliamentary resolutions. It s as if Tamil political leaders are afraid to speak the truth about India   lest the patron turns its back.  But increasingly, younger Tamils are asking: Is silence about Indian betrayal a prerequisite for Tamil leadership? The Future: Engagement, Not Submission As Sri Lanka slowly emerges from its post-default fog and grapples with systemic reforms, the question remains: Will Tamil politicians finally turn inward and engage with the country s evolving democratic space, or will they continue to outsource Tamil destiny to a foreign capital that has done more harm than good? There are signs of a generational shift. Grassroots Tamil movements in the north are beginning to bypass party structures. Young leaders are calling for cross-ethnic coalitions, justice for war victims, land rights, and language equality   within the framework of Sri Lanka s evolving political architecture.  We need truth. We need courage,  said 28-year-old activist Yalini Thurairajah, speaking at a recent youth forum in Batticaloa.  And we need leaders who stop asking for favours and start demanding rights   here, not in Delhi.  -By LeN South Asia Correspondent --------------------------- by (2025-07-04 23:18:18) We are unable to continue LeN without your kind donation.

        "title": "Retracing historical and cultural links between Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka",
        "content": "By T. Ramakrishnan The recently consecrated Thiruketheeswaram temple in Mannar in Sri Lanka s Northern Province has come to symbolise close ties between Tamil Nadu and the island nation, thanks to the involvement of the Government College of Architecture and Sculpture, Mamallapuram, in the temple s restoration. Regarded as one of the five important abodes of Lord Shiva in Sri Lanka, the temple, said to have been worshipped by Saivite saint Thirugnanasambandar, was damaged during the protracted civil war that ended in May 2009. It had a fresh lease of life following the Indian government s decision to fund the renovation project and lend its technical expertise. The  mahamandapam  was renovated with the support of the Mamallapuram college and materials, including granites, were procured from Tamil Nadu. While the Indian government provided a grant of LKR 320 million for the restoration, which eventually cost LKR 900 million, the Archaeological Survey of India supervised its execution. Beyond Thirukeetheswaram, the relationship between the two territories can be traced to the proto-historic times. Marks, similar to graffiti inscribed potsherds discovered during early excavations at Adichanallur, Korkai and many other sites of the Early Historic period, were recovered from places such as Tissamaharama, Kantarodai, Manthai and Ridiyagama in Sri Lanka, according to a 2019 publication of the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology on Keeladi. Historians also refer to continuous trade links between the two regions, citing the discoveries in Tamil Nadu of Sinhala Prakrit inscriptions on pottery. In fact, veteran numismatist, art historian and archaeologist of Sri Lanka Osmund Bopearachchi has even recorded in a 2008 paper on ancient Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu that Sinhalese traders were present in Tamil Nadu in the same period when Tamil traders were active at Anuradhapura and Tissamaharama in Sri Lanka. He has also stated that the epigraphic and literary evidence for  the active role played by Tamil merchants in the early phase of Sri Lanka s history is numerous . In a conversation with this newspaper in 2017, Dr. Bopearachchi, former Adjunct Professor of Central and South Asian Art, Archaeology, and Numismatics, University of California, Berkeley, said,  The earliest coins found in Sri Lanka were Pandya and Chera coins.  In K.A. Nilakanta Sastri s seminal work, A History of South India, one can find numerous accounts of battles between rulers of southern India and Sri Lanka. A significant account of them pertains to how Rajendra Chola-I (1012-44 CE) completed the conquest of Sri Lanka begun by his father Rajaraja Chola (985-1016 CE) and Mahinda V s son, Kassapa, became the centre of Sinhalese resistance to the Tamil power. Sri Lanka s prominent historian K.M. de Silva, in his landmark work A History of Sri Lanka, points out that Nayakkars, who belonged to the Vaduga caste,  a Telugu-speaking group originally hailing from Madurai,  established marriage ties with the Kandyan royal family during the 17th century. He adds that the accession of the Nayakkar dynasty to the Kandyan throne in 1739 CE was  accommodated with the minimum of disturbance . On the side of culture and religion, Kataragama in the deep south, once regarded by people in Tamil Nadu as one of the six abodes of Lord Muruga, has shrines for Muruga, Shiva and Deivanai Amman, making any visitor from Tamil Nadu feel at home. Aimed at attracting a larger number of tourists from Tamil Nadu, the Sri Lankan authorities are planning to launch a Muruga trail, apart from the old Ramayana trail. Rajaraja Chola had got people of Sri Lanka involved in the construction of the Brihadeeswara temple in Thanjavur, says M. Rajendran, former Vice-Chancellor of Tamil University. G.P.V. Somaratna, former Head of Department of History and Political Science, University of Colombo, in his paper  Tamil Buddhism in Sri Lanka , states that the presence of Buddhism in ancient Tamil Nadu had a  great impact  on Buddhist activities in Sri Lanka and the northern part of the island in particular. Since the classical period, there have been significant contributions from literary personalities belonging to Sri Lanka s Tamils to Tamil literature. Tamil scholar of yesteryear Mu. Varadarajan, in his work on the history of Tamil literature ( Tamil Illakkiya Varalaru), records that Eezhathu Poothanthevanar, a poet from Sri Lanka, had composed seven verses of the Sangam anthology. Ayathurai Santhan, an award-winning Sri Lankan Tamil writer, notes that one of the Tamil classics, Manimekalai, refers to an islet, Manipallavam, which has been identified with the present Nainativu of Sri Lanka. Dr. Rajendran observes that the Pathni cult, the worship of Kannaki, had spread to Sri Lanka from Tamil Nadu. Prominent scholars Arumuga Navalar (1822-1889) and C.V. Damodaram Pillai (1832-1901) had strong connections with Chennai. Tiruppur Krishnan, editor of Amudhasurabhi, refers to Vipulananda Adigal (1892-1947), who was known not only for his work in the expansion of activities of Ramakrishna Mission in Sri Lanka but also for his contribution to Tamil literature. He recalls how veteran writer-editors such as Ki. Va. Jagannathan (1906-88) and Naa. Parthasarathy (1932-87) made it a point to visit Sri Lanka regularly for mobilising subscriptions for their journals, Kalaimagal and Deepam. Mr. Santhan is of the view that K. Kailasapathy, Karthigesu Sivathamby, Dominic Jeeva and Se. Ganesalingan were among those who left behind a huge impact on the Tamil literary field. In recent years, the social relationship between people of Sri Lanka and those of India in general, Tamil Nadu in particular, has only grown due to a variety of reasons. Be it the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom or the present spell of economic crisis, sections of Sri Lankan society have found in Tamil Nadu a safe haven. But, given the historical, cultural and sociological factors, there are deeper reasons for the peoples of the two lands to be closer than what they have been. (The Hindu)",

        "title": "Sri Lankan Newsrooms In The 1950s: Before The Advent Of The Internet, Phones, And Smartphones",
        "content": "The 1950s are considered the  golden age  of Sri Lankan journalism, producing many giants such as Denzil Peiris, Mervyn de Silva, Tarzie Vittachi, Ira Amarasekera, and Piyasena Nissanka. At the time, there were only two main news publishers in the country the Times group and the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited, better known as the  Lake House . Both these companies were privately owned and had large audiences because newspapers and radios were the only methods of communications during that era. The Times group published two main newspapers the Times of Ceylon and the Lankadeepa, while the Lake House published the Daily News, Dinamina, Thinakaran, and the Sunday Observer. The journalists produced in Sri Lanka at that time were considered to be on par with their contemporaries abroad, despite working under conditions very different to our own: news publishers of the 1950s were not exposed to the advent of mobile phones, the internet, and smartphones, and news was gathered and produced in ways very different from now. Dress code Even the way a journalist dressed in the 1950s was very different to the way they dressed now, veteran editor Edmund Ranasinghe told Roar Media. Today, journalists mostly dress in casual clothing an untucked shirt with pants or jeans, for instance but the journalist of the 1950s was expected to wear a shirt and a tie. Coats were also mandatory if setting out for an assignment, as was a hat a dictum probably influenced by the British. One thing in particular that stood out then, from the way things are done now, is the manner in which relationships with  sources  are cultivated, Edmund Ranasinghe told Roar Media. Back in the day, journalists actively cultivated relationships with politicians, ministers, departments heads, and other officers of import, and maintained close links with them to preserve their sources of news. As there were no messaging or emailing platforms, it was important that the journalist kept in touch with decision makers and other people directly affecting his  beat . It was common for journalists to make appointments with politicians, ministers, departments heads, and other people in the morning hours, during which meeting, information was gathered. Deadlines for article submissions were at 1.pm, Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa, Sri Lanka s oldest active journalist told Roar Media. Journalists who went out into the  field  were expected to type out their articles and submit them to their respective News Editors before 1.pm. Whatever research was necessary for the article must also be accrued by these journalists through means far more difficult than the click away we are accustomed to; there was no internet, with its wealth of information, nor yet browsers like Google to make search easier. Instead, journalists had to pore through books and clippings at public and private libraries to find what they were looking for, and laboriously take down that information by pen before painstakingly crafting their  story  for news publications. The newspaper publishers (that is to say, the Times group and the  Lake House ) both had extensive libraries which were liberally used by the journalists in the 1950s and thereafter. Library staff maintained dossiers on notable figures of authority both in Sri Lanka and abroad, for easy access. The dossiers contained paper cutting with important information regarding people of national and international importance, and journalists were wont to sift through them to find a particular article in which a statement or action taken by a leader was documented. It was also necessary for the newsman of yore to be well-read and possess a deep knowledge of current local and international affairs. While in modern times information is only a few clicks away, the journalist from the 1950s was expected to be on his/her toes, able to engage in deep conversation on matters of national and international importance at any given time. D.F. Kariyakarawana, a former Editor at Lake House for the Janatha and Silumina papers, who worked at the Times Group and Lake House as a journalist in the 1950s wrote in his memoirs Memories of Seven Decades,  Editors back in the day thought a good English knowledge was essential even for a Sinhala language journalist going out on coverage. The same applied to photographers working with Sinhala newspapers. For instance, I remember three Burgher photographers who worked for Dinamina (a Sinhala daily newspaper) namely Don Pascal, Harvey Campbell, and Neil Moses. Even the cartoonist of the Dinamina newspaper in the 1950s was a Burgher by the name of Mark Gerrain. He could hardly write in Sinhala, although he was attached to a Sinhala paper.  International news International news was gathered by means of a teleprinter, which was connected to the Reuters newswire service, Edmund Ranasinghe told Roar Media. The machine would unceasingly print out news of international importance which was gathered by the International News Editor who earmarked the more important ones for the next day s newspaper print. This was not an easy task and an International News Editor often had a team of journalists below him to help. The newsrooms were male-dominated, Edmund Ranasinghe admits. He did say, however, that there were a few women who worked in newsrooms, mainly in the function of Sub-Editors or Features editors a feature present even today. Because newsrooms jobs or jobs as reporters were not considered female-friendly, it deterred many women from taking up jobs in the newsrooms. However, two notable female journalists emerged from that era Roshan Peiris and Ranji Handy. The kickback on smoking indoors had not taken place yet, Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa said, guiltily admitting he had been a chain smoker when he was younger, to the extent he had a lit cigarette in his hand, even while having lunch.  Till I developed a cough,  he said.  After which the doctor told me,  Young man, you will be dead before you turn 30 if you continue this way , and I quit the habit from that point on.  That didn t stop the other writers and editors from smoking both pipes and cigarettes, however, as smoking continued unabated in the newsrooms. Often, by the time lunch was over, a sizable proportion of the newsroom was already  in the cups . It appears that this did not affect their work because some of the finest journalists Sri Lanka produced were from that era. Fraternity Because the two main newspaper publishers were based in the Fort area, journalists from the rival papers often fraternized with each other at the cafes and restaurants on Chatham Street, Hospital Lane, at the Nippon Hotel, at the Lord Nelson, and the National Bar. It was customary for reporters to hang out at these restaurants and bars after work or during the day. It was here that many interesting stories were exchanged over a drink and ideas part of a journalistic lifestyle. D.F. Kariyakarawana writes in his memoirs,  During my days at the Times group, it was almost a daily ritual to go to Ratnagiri, after work (Ratnagiri is a hotel and bar located opposite to the WTC building at Echelons Square, Colombo Fort). Neville Dillamort, Chief Sub Editor of Times of Ceylon, and Ervin Moonamalai, the Chief Reporter of the paper, also joined us. Almost a half of my monthly salary was spent on Ratnagiri. Aside from drinks, our lunch was also bought from Ratnagiri.  This tradition appears to be perpetuated even by modern journalists, who often visit the Ratnagiri and other smaller bars in the Fort area to fraternize with each other over stories. Although the way stories are gathered, crafted and published has changed so much with the advent of the internet and web publishing, there are many aspects of the newsroom that remain unchanged. The passion a journalist has for pursuing a story, the idea that newspapers can create change, can chronicle events for posterity, continues to live strong in the mind of aspirants. Journalism is not easy, nor yet a popular career for many, but for those who choose it, it is a literary life. Cover: The landmark  Lake House  building, that still stands today.

        "title": "Overview of the Sri Lankan Civil War",
        "content": "Key Takeaways The Sri Lankan Civil War started because of ethnic tensions between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities. The British colonial rule aggravated tensions by favoring Tamils, creating resentment among the Sinhalese majority. The war ended in 2009 with a government victory after a long and bloody conflict. In the late 20th century, the island nation of Sri Lanka tore itself apart in a brutal civil war. At the most basic level, the conflict arose from the ethnic tension between Sinhalese and Tamil citizens. In reality, though, the causes were much more complex and arose in large part because of Sri Lanka's colonial history. Background Great Britain ruled Sri Lanka then called Ceylon from 1815 to 1948. When the British arrived, the country was dominated by Sinhalese speakers whose ancestors likely arrived on the island from India in the 500s BCE. Sri Lankan people seem to have been in contact with Tamil speakers from southern India since at least the second century BCE, but migrations of significant numbers of Tamils to the island appear to have taken place later, between the seventh and 11th centuries CE. In 1815, the population of Ceylon numbered about three million predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese and 300,000 mostly Hindu Tamils. The British established huge cash crop plantations on the island, first of coffee, and later of rubber and tea. Colonial officials brought in approximately a million Tamil speakers from India to work as plantation laborers. The British also established schools in the northern, Tamil-majority part of the colony, and preferentially appointed Tamils to bureaucratic positions, angering the Sinhalese majority. This was a common divide-and-rule tactic in European colonies that had troubling results in the post-colonial era in places such as Rwanda and Sudan. Civil War Erupts The British granted Ceylon independence in 1948. The Sinhalese majority immediately began to pass laws that discriminated against Tamils, particularly the Indian Tamils brought to the island by the British. They made Sinhalese the official language, driving Tamils out of the civil service. The Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948 effectively barred Indian Tamils from holding citizenship, making stateless people out of some 700,000. This was not remedied until 2003, and anger over such measures fueled the bloody rioting that broke out repeatedly in the following years. After decades of increasing ethnic tension, the war began as a low-level insurgency in July 1983. Ethnic riots broke out in Colombo and other cities. Tamil Tiger insurgents killed 13 army soldiers, prompting violent reprisals against Tamil civilians by their Sinhalese neighbors across the country. Between 2,500 and 3,000 Tamils likely died, and many thousands more fled to Tamil-majority regions. The Tamil Tigers declared the \"First Eelam War\" (1983-87) with the aim of creating a separate Tamil state in northern Sri Lanka called Eelam. Much of the fighting was directed initially at other Tamil factions; the Tigers massacred their opponents and consolidated power over the separatist movement by 1986. At the outbreak of the war, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India offered to mediate a settlement. However, the Sri Lankan government distrusted her motivations, and it was later shown that her government was arming and training Tamil guerrillas in camps in southern India. Relations between the Sri Lankan government and India deteriorated, as Sri Lankan coast guards seized Indian fishing boats to search for weapons. Over the next few years, violence escalated as the Tamil insurgents used car bombs, suitcase bombs, and landmines against Sinhalese military and civilian targets. The quickly-expanding Sri Lankan army responded by rounding up Tamil youths and torturing and disappearing them. India Intervenes In 1987, India's Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, decided to directly intervene in the Sri Lankan Civil War by sending peacekeepers. India was concerned about separatism in its own Tamil region, Tamil Nadu, as well as a potential flood of refugees from Sri Lanka. The peacekeepers' mission was to disarm militants on both sides, in preparation for peace talks. The Indian peacekeeping force of 100,000 troops not only was unable to quell the conflict, it actually began fighting with the Tamil Tigers. The Tigers refused to disarm, sent female bombers and child soldiers to attack the Indians, and relations escalated into running skirmishes between the peacekeeping troops and the Tamil guerrillas. In May 1990, Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa forced India to recall its peacekeepers; 1,200 Indian soldiers had died battling the insurgents. The following year, a female Tamil suicide bomber named Thenmozhi Rajaratnam assassinated Rajiv Gandhi at an election rally. President Premadasa would die in a similar attack in May 1993. Second Eelam War After the peacekeepers withdrew, the Sri Lankan Civil War entered an even bloodier phase, which the Tamil Tigers named the Second Eelam War. It began when the Tigers seized between 600 and 700 Sinhalese police officers in the Eastern Province on June 11, 1990, in an effort to weaken government control there. The police laid down their weapons and surrendered to the militants after the Tigers promised no harm would come to them. However, the militants took the policemen into the jungle, forced them to kneel, and shot them all dead, one by one. A week later, the Sri Lankan Minister of Defense announced, \"From now on, it is all out war.\" The government cut off all shipments of medicine and food to the Tamil stronghold on the Jaffna peninsula and initiated an intensive aerial bombardment. The Tigers responded with massacres of hundreds of Sinhalese and Muslim villagers. Muslim self-defense units and government troops conducted tit-for-tat massacres in Tamil villages. The government also massacred Sinhalese school children in Sooriyakanda and buried the bodies in a mass grave, because the town was a base for the Sinhala splinter group known as the JVP. In July 1991, 5,000 Tamil Tigers surrounded the government's army base at Elephant Pass, laying siege to it for a month. The pass is a bottleneck leading to the Jaffna Peninsula, a key strategic point in the region. Some 10,000 government troops raised the siege after four weeks, but over 2,000 fighters on both sides had been killed, making this the bloodiest battle in the entire civil war. Although they held this chokepoint, government troops could not capture Jaffna itself despite repeated assaults in 1992-93. Third Eelam War January 1995 saw the Tamil Tigers sign a peace agreement with the new government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga. However, three months later the Tigers planted explosives on two Sri Lankan naval gunboats, destroying the ships and the peace accord. The government responded by declaring a \"war for peace,\" in which Air Force jets pounded civilian sites and refugee camps on the Jaffna Peninsula, while ground troops perpetrated a number of massacres against civilians in Tampalakamam, Kumarapuram, and elsewhere. By December 1995, the peninsula was under government control for the first time since the war began. Some 350,000 Tamil refugees and the Tiger guerrillas fled inland to the sparsely populated Vanni region of the Northern Province. The Tamil Tigers responded to the loss of Jaffna in July 1996 by launching an eight-day assault on the town of Mullaitivu, which was protected by 1,400 government troops. Despite air support from the Sri Lankan Air Force, the government position was overrun by the 4,000-strong guerrilla army in a decisive Tiger victory. More than 1,200 of the government soldiers were killed, including about 200 who were doused with gasoline and burned alive after they surrendered; the Tigers lost 332 troops. Another aspect of the war took place simultaneously in the capital of Colombo and other southern cities, where Tiger suicide bombers struck repeatedly in the late 1990s. They hit the Central Bank in Colombo, the Sri Lankan World Trade Centre, and the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, a shrine housing a relic of the Buddha himself. A suicide bomber tried to assassinate President Chandrika Kumaratunga in December 1999 she survived but lost her right eye. In April 2000, the Tigers retook Elephant Pass but were unable to recover the city of Jaffna. Norway began trying to negotiate a settlement, as war-weary Sri Lankans of all ethnic groups looked for a way to end the interminable conflict. The Tamil Tigers declared a unilateral ceasefire in December 2000, leading to hope that the civil war was truly winding down. However, in April 2001, the Tigers rescinded the ceasefire and pushed north on the Jaffna Peninsula once more. A July 2001 Tiger suicide attack on the Bandaranaike International Airport destroyed eight military jets and four airliners, sending Sri Lanka's tourism industry into a tailspin. Long Road to Peace The September 11 attacks in the United States and the subsequent War on Terror made it more difficult for the Tamil Tigers to get overseas funding and support. The United States also began to offer direct aid to the Sri Lankan government, despite its terrible human rights record over the course of the civil war. Public weariness with the fighting led to President Kumaratunga's party losing control of parliament and the election of a new, pro-peace government. Throughout 2002 and 2003, the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers negotiated various ceasefires and signed a Memorandum of Understanding, again mediated by the Norwegians. The two sides compromised with a federal solution, rather than the Tamils' demand for a two-state solution or the government's insistence on a unitary state. Air and ground traffic resumed between Jaffna and the rest of Sri Lanka. However, on October 31, 2003, the Tigers declared themselves in full control of the north and east regions of the country, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency. Within just over a year, monitors from Norway recorded 300 infractions of the ceasefire by the army and 3,000 by the Tamil Tigers. When the Indian Ocean Tsunami hit Sri Lanka on December 26, 2004, it killed 35,000 people and sparked another disagreement between the Tigers and the government over how to distribute aid in Tiger-held areas. On August 12, 2005, the Tamil Tigers lost much of their remaining cachet with the international community when one of their snipers killed Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a highly respected ethnic Tamil who was critical of Tiger tactics. Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran warned that his guerrillas would go on the offensive once more in 2006 if the government failed to implement the peace plan. Fighting erupted again, including the bombing of civilian targets such as packed commuter trains and buses in Colombo. The government also began assassinating pro-Tiger journalists and politicians. Massacres against civilians on both sides left thousands dead over the next few years, including 17 charity workers from France's \"Action Against Hunger,\" who were shot down in their office. On September 4, 2006, the army drove the Tamil Tigers from the key coastal city of Sampur. The Tigers retaliated by bombing a naval convoy, killing more than 100 sailors who were on shore leave. After October 2006 peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, did not produce results, the Sri Lankan government launched a massive offensive in eastern and northern parts of the islands to crush the Tamil Tigers once and for all. The 2007-2009 eastern and northern offensives were extremely bloody, with tens of thousands of civilians caught between the army and Tiger lines. Entire villages were left depopulated and ruined in what a U.N. spokesman termed \"a bloodbath.\" As the government troops closed in on the last rebel strongholds, some Tigers blew themselves up. Others were summarily executed by the soldiers after they surrendered, and these war crimes were captured on video. On May 16, 2009, the Sri Lankan government declared victory over the Tamil Tigers. The following day, an official Tiger website conceded that \"This battle has reached its bitter end.\" People in Sri Lanka and around the world expressed relief that the devastating conflict had finally ended after 26 years, hideous atrocities on both sides, and some 100,000 deaths. The only question remaining is whether the perpetrators of those atrocities will face trials for their crimes.",

In this article, Ananay Agarwal examines the economic causes of the problem, along with the most recent agreement between the IMF and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka formally went into default on its debt obligations in April 2022, which marks the official time-period when the situation went from imminent crisis to present crisis. The default immediately resulted in runaway inflation and a shortage of essential supplies like fuel, paper, and food. Shortly thereafter, the Sri Lankan public, frustrated with its political leaders, besieged the President s Mansion in Colombo, leading to iconic images of crowds in the presidential swimming pool. This public outcry and anger forced President Rajapaksa to relinquish his office and paved the way for Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to win the Presidency. As the economy gradually began to improve under Wickremesinghe, the most violent of protests had largely subsided by November 2022. As of writing, a path to resolve the situation and move the country forward has been constructed, and the path is being travelled upon, but the future is still uncertain. Building up to the Economic Crisis: The Post Civil-War Boom When Sri Lanka s civil war came to an end in 2009, the country s economy saw a substantial post-war boom. The economy started to show signs of life as the country s infrastructure was renewed and security was strengthened. This boom, though, turned out be just temporary, and the growth could did not continue for more than three years. The graph below shows that by 2012, the GDP growth rate had dropped significantly, from over 8% to roughly 4% and never fully recovered to the highs of the early 2010s. A small political elite emerged in the years following the civil war, controlling the economy and steering the nation away from pro-growth policies and toward personal gain. Foreign investments had dried up as a result of the conflict, and the new regulations established substantial trade hurdles for foreign corporations to invest in the nation as well as competitive barriers for new domestic firms to emerge without major political backing. Furthermore, with the Great Recession in full swing, prices for Sri Lanka s two main exports   tea and rubber   saw a sharp drop in value, further depressing the post-war boom. White Elephants The term  white elephant  is used to describe a large-scale public investment project that is expensive to create and maintain, but does not produce sufficient economic returns or advantages to justify its cost. In the 2010s, Sri Lanka ended up opting for several such projects with funding from Chinese Banks. These include: 1. Hambantota Port: Located in southern Sri Lanka and funded by Chinese loans, the port was intended to act as a trans-shipment hub before the Malacca Strait. However, the project ballooned in cost, and the Sri Lankan government eventually handed control of the port to China on a 99 year lease. There were also several accusations of corruption, and many Sri Lankans even wondered if the port was ever required in the first place. 2. Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport: Also funded by Chinese banks, this Airport was opened in 2013 and intended to act as a second international airport to serve the capital city of Colombo. Initially many airlines did opt to use it, including Sri Lankan Airlines, but by 2018 all airlines had left. It was even dubbed the  World s Emptiest International Airport  by Forbes magazine due to its low number of passengers and flights, and comparatively gargantuan size. 3. Lotus Tower: The tower is a 350 metres tall telecommunications tower, and has been criticised for its exorbitantly high cost and allegations of scams. Moreover, its location has also been questioned, with broadcasters saying that the tower neither covers all of Sri Lanka, nor improved the quality of current transmissions. 4. Lakvijaya Power Station: Sri Lanka s largest power plant and accounting for nearly 15% of its tower power supply, the station has faced several breakdowns since its inception in 2011. It has been alleged that the government agreed to use sub-standard materials in its agreement, which might be responsible for its frequent failures. 2019 Easter Bombing Over 250 people were killed in a string of Easter-related bombings in three churches and three hotels in Colombo in April 2019. Aside from the horrific loss of life and destruction of property, tourism   one of the main drivers of Sri Lanka s GDP   immediately took a hit. Between 2018 and 2019, spending by international tourists decreased by 16.85%, and between 2019 and 2020, spending decreased by an extraordinary 76.92%. The below graph from MacroTrends shows very clearly that International Tourist spending   which in the 2010s was accounting for 20% of Sri Lankan exports   plummeted in 2019. The decline in tourist arrivals also negatively impacted other sectors of the economy reliant on it like hospitality and transportation. The worst hit were self-employed individuals. Business that had hitherto been operating even during the worst phase of the Civil War were forced to shutter as tourists stayed away. GDP actually declined by 0.2% in 2019, owing chiefly to the Easter Bombings and subsequent Covid outbreak later in the year. Covid-19 Outbreak The outbreak of Covid-19 was an epoch defining event, and the world struggled to overcome it, with Sri Lanka being no exception. However, with an economy heavily reliant on tourists and the export of tea and rubber, the island nation s economy faced an even bleaker time. In conjunction with the Easter Bombings, tourism completely dried up. Hundreds of businesses in Sri Lanka that cater to tourists were forced to shut down as the world went into lockdown and international travel ceased to exist. Additionally, as demand for its main exports declined, so did their prices, which negatively impacted its balance of payments. On the other hand, remittances from Sri Lankans living overseas decreased as more people lost their jobs globally. The pandemic also compelled the government to increase its budgetary expenditure and keep the economy from going down an even darker path. However, the incumbent Rajapaksa government had already slashed taxes in 2019 as a poll-promise, and this policy came back to bite them. The combination of falling revenues and rising spending caused the fiscal deficit to balloon to more than 10% in 2020. In hindsight, this was the first canary in the coal mine that Sri Lanka is in trouble. Overnight Switch to Organic Farming The final nail in the coffin was an almost overnight switch to organic farming. In a bid to address its balance of payments crisis, President Rajapaksa was advised that if the country stopped using imported chemical fertilisers, the import bill would fall and subsequently reduce pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The President began to position himself as an environmental champion and his country a haven for organic farming, and consequently banned   in one fell swoop   all chemical fertilisers from May 2021. Many environmental organisations applauded his decision and praised him as an example to be followed. However, this policy had an extremely detrimental outcome. Farmers were left completely unprepared for the ensuing decline in soil productivity, having little to no notice to prepare them. Food scarcity resulted from the nation s agricultural output falling to an all-time low and consequently, inflation shot through the roof. Ironically, this compelled the nation to import more food, undermining the very rationale behind this policy. In the end, a measure taken to alleviate pressure on forex reserves had the opposite effect and harmed them the most, serving as the proximate cause of the subsequent economic crisis. Historic Dealings with the IMF The International Monetary Fund and Sri Lanka have had extensive dealings since the mid-1960s. In the past 56-year period, approximately 33 years have been spent under the macro-economic management of the IMF, as shown by the graph below. It is to be noted that the IMF fully distributed the agreed funds under 12 of these 16 agreements, with Sri Lanka failing to meet the conditions for the full disbursement of the remainder. The relationship between Sri Lanka and the IMF is multi-faceted and complex, and one should be careful to not attach simplistic  good  or  bad  narratives to both actors. The IMF, with its heavy ideological baggage of adhering to the Washington Consensus, did not always take into account the unique position of Sri Lanka s geography or its institutions. Similarly, Sri Lankan politicians have always been quick to cast the IMF as a neo-colonialist entity and refused to implement policies that are unpopular in the short-term but beneficial for its long-term macro-economic stability. Regardless of the narrative, the fact however is that the Sri Lankan economy has been running on a periodic cycle fuelled by unsustainable debt for decades. The debt is used to finance fiscal and current account deficits, an economic upturn occurs, and politicians kick the proverbial problem down the road to the future generation. Invariably, when the global economy coughs and debts are called in, Sri Lanka catches a cold. The country has unfortunately followed a pattern where it sets out onto the path of fiscal reform to stabilise its economic system, but then reverses direction and fall back into crisis. The 2023 IMF deal On March 20, 2023, the IMF and Sri Lanka signed an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreement to help bring the country out of its economic quagmire. The 48-month arrangement will infuse capital into the country s coffers and allow it to pay for necessary imports like food and fuel. This should give enough policy room to the government led by President Wickremesinghe, to implement structural changes in the economy. The President has also stated the EFF should help increase confidence in the country s economy and allow the government to access another 7 billion USD in funding from other multilateral and international creditors. The IMF immediately released 0.333 billion USD in funds, with more expected to be released in the following months. What is an EFF? The EFF, or Extended Fund Facility is one of IMF s several financial assistance programs, with others being the Stand-By-Arrangement (SBA) and Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI). The choice of program the IMF chooses to utilise depends on the specific needs and problems of the country in question. The EFF is designed to support countries that are facing a balance of payments crisis. It is aimed at helping countries implement long-term structural reforms in their economy so that underlying macro-economic difficulties can be addressed. Under this program, the country in question receives financial assistance in the form of loans or credits for three to four years from the IMF, but with several strings attached. The recipient country is typically required to pass reforms that are aimed at restoring macro-economic stability, reducing fiscal deficits, improving tax collections, reduce government expenditure, and increase productivity and efficiency of state institutions. The official IMF statement has identified four key areas in which reforms are to be implemented   Tax Administration, Public Financial and Expenditure Management, Energy Pricing, and Anti-Corruption Legislation. Tax Administration The last three IMF programs, in addition to the new one in 2023, have primarily focused on addressing the low tax collections of the Sri Lankan government. In December 2019, the government slashed indirect taxes like Value-Added-Taxes (VAT) from 15% to 8%, and the corporate income tax rate from 28% to 24% as poll promises. In addition, other taxes like the nation-building tax of 2%, the Economic Service Charge and PAYE, were also abolished. As a result, Sri Lanka had one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP ratios in 2021. Total tax revenues fell by over 520 million LKR between 2019 and 2020, i.e. nearly 30%. On the flip side, Covid-19 and the Organic Farming fiasco caused an increase in government expenditure by nearly 550 million LKR. This included things like Covid relief assistance through the State Ministry and recruitment of 160,000 unskilled an unemployed graduates. Together, the budget deficit rose by over 100% between 2019 and 2020. The IMF has strongly urged Sri Lanka to implement  progressive  taxes, i.e. charging more tax from the rich, instead of  regressive  taxes, i.e. charging more tax from the poor. Indirect taxes are strongly regressive in nature, since they are taxes paid on the consumption of goods and services. Hence, regardless of income, consumers pay the same tax, implying that poorer people end up spending a greater portion of their income on indirect taxes than wealthier individuals. By adopting more progressive taxes, Sri Lanka should ideally shift away from its heavy reliance on indirect taxes (over 80%) to more sustainable sources of tax income. Public Financial and Expenditure Management The IMF has effectively asked the Sri Lankan government to  tighten its belt  so to speak. It should spend only within its means and cut down on its deficit. A big part of this involves restructuring its external debt obligations from other multilateral and international creditors. This might be in direct reference to the several white elephant projects the country has invested in, many of which have been more hassle than benefit. Sri Lanka needs to consider its long-term finances and act judiciously instead of impulsively funding projects without considering its costs and benefits. Energy Pricing Sri Lanka is significantly dependent on fuel imports from abroad because the country does not possess a significant endowment of hydrocarbons. As a result, supply and demand dynamics on the commodity markets determine energy prices in Sri Lanka. With the Russian-Ukraine war, the cost of coal and oil increased, and Sri Lanka had to pay more to maintain its fuel supply. In order to maintain fuel imports and the island s supply of electricity, the Sri Lankan government started using up its foreign exchange reserves of USD at an unsustainable rate to continue buying fuel in the international market. Eventually, this was no longer feasible, and a decline in resource imports brought about national fuel rationing and electrical shortages. This fuel rationing and electrical shortages made it clear that Sri Lanka and its citizens were at the mercy of uncertain international energy markets. Since the country imports nearly two-thirds of its fuel, the IMF wants Sri Lanka to diversify its energy sector away from hydrocarbons. Shifting to green and renewable sources of energy like wind, solar, or tidal will ensure a more stable supply of electricity to the country and also decrease the pressure on its foreign exchange reserves. Anti-Corruption Legislation The IMF has praised the ongoing efforts of the country in tackling corruption, and asked that they continue and ultimately culminate in revamping anti-corruption legislation. The IMF will also continue conducting the governance diagnostic mission that will assess Sri Lanka s anti-corruption and governance framework. Such governance diagnostic studies have recently been conducted by the IMF in Moldova, the Republic of Congo, Mauritania, and Zambia. The reports on the Republic of Congo, Zambia, Moldova, and Mauritania are all available online. The IMF believes that these analyses are instruments that nations may employ to build strong governance structures and strengthen the rule of law. In all four nations, the IMF teams examined the central bank s governance, the financial and fiscal sectors, the protection of property and contract rights, the tax system, and anti-money laundering systems. It seems clear that the diagnostic framework on Sri Lanka will look at the same items given the press briefing released by the IMF. The diagnostic framework however has been heavily criticised due its strong ideological tinge in neoliberal economics, and been called a propaganda tool to legitimise austerity. The fact that the Sri Lankan government has currently authorized the sale of a number of profitable State-Owned Companies is particularly pertinent to notice. This choice has most likely been made under pressure from the IMF that believes that governments shouldn t become involved in business. Regardless, the authorisation of these sales encouraged strikes by labour unions and in turn triggered the outlawing of strikes by the government. Conclusion With the benefit of hindsight, it is not unreasonable to say that the current crisis is a repeat of a historical pattern that has regularly played out in Sri Lanka. This time however, the crisis has been particularly acute and there is a very real chance that Sri Lanka can veer off its debt fuelled trajectory. The way forward for Sri Lanka lies in making imperfect policy choices. Firstly, significant hikes in taxation, particularly indirect taxes like VAT, will disproportionately affect the poor and less well-off, at a time when they are already facing the brunt of the crisis. However, high tax collections is one of the conditions that the IMF has imposed, and indeed greater revenue will certainly create a healthier economy in the longer term. Secondly, the government must also spend only within its means, but this will certainly reduce the societal benefits it provides to its citizens. It is thus unclear how Sri Lanka will accomplish the IMF s simultaneous demands for  expenditure management  and an increase in social benefits. Thirdly, diversifying away from hydrocarbons to green energy might sound good on paper, but has the potential to make Sri Lanka even more reliant on weather patterns and the monsoons, since these will then directly affect its energy production. Lastly, while corruption is a menace in Sri Lankan society and certainly needs to be combatted, there is a case to be made that the IMF is no moral superman, and its diagnostic framework a tool to legitimise its authority and ideology. The most likely conclusion is that Sri Lanka recovers from the crisis  better than before,  with the likelihood of the two extremes reverting to previous behaviours or becoming a wholly different Sri Lanka being far lower.

        "title": "The Sri Lankan Civil War and Its History, Revisited in 2020",
        "content": "On June 9, 2020, Sri Lankans occupied the streets outside the US Embassy in Sri Lanka s capital, Colombo, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, holding signs condemning the racism, police brutality, and other maladies plaguing the United States. Sri Lanka s social issues also came to light at this protest. The country, after all, has its history of ethnic strife and is currently mending after the end of a long, brutal civil war. As the nation attempts to heal, Sri Lanka continues to sustain new injuries to its social and political structures that reveal much larger systemic problems. Police arrived at the demonstration and violently dispersed protesters arresting at least 53 individuals supposedly to enforce public health restrictions related to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the police s ferocity was unsettling. Some footage, for instance,  showed a young woman being tossed into a police vehicle, head first.  One of the protest s organizers, Pubudu Jayagoda, indicated that the Sri Lankan government had been  downplaying coronavirus health risks,  implying that the police perhaps had ulterior motives and revealing his disillusionment with the government s policing power. Such growing disenchantment with the Sri Lankan government represents just one problem amongst the country's history of ethnic tensions. Sri Lanka s present is haunted by memories of the island s decades-long civil war, which began in 1983 and ended just over 10 years ago. The war was mainly a clash between the Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) insurgent group, the latter of which had hoped to establish a separate state for the Tamil minority. The mainstream narrative suggests that the civil war was derived from tensions between the Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic groups. However, the war also represented the legacy of British imperialism. This alternative analysis suggests that the ethnic conflicts were symptoms of a much larger problem, rejecting the oversimplified narrative that Sri Lanka is home to a people that are perpetually clashing with one another due to ethnic incompatibilities. Instead, the analysis surrounding the legacy of British imperialism embraces the idea that Sri Lanka s conflict has much to do with each group fighting to reclaim its dignity and power, albeit at the expense of the other. A post-colonial analysis reveals that both the Sinhalese and Tamils acted to recover what they believed they had lost during their respective golden eras, imperial rule for the Sinhalese and shortly after for the Tamils. Present moments like the June 9th protest are no longer surprising and clearly align with Sri Lanka s broader history under this interpretation. Perhaps more importantly, this post-colonial narrative suggests that Sri Lanka s conflicts are not in the past; rather, the conflicts continue to manifest through the government s leadership in moments much like the Colombo protests. An Origin Story Sri Lanka is 74.9 percent Sinhalese and 11.2 percent Sri Lankan Tamil. Within these two groups, Sinhalese tend to be Buddhist and Tamils tend to be Hindu, displaying significant linguistic and religious divisions. However, the strife between the grounds purportedly began much further back in Sri Lanka s ancient settlement history. Though the Sinhalese people s arrival in Sri Lanka is somewhat ambiguous, historians believe that the Tamils arrived on the island both as invaders and traders from India s Chola Kingdom. These origin stories suggest that the Sinhalese and Tamil communities have experienced tension from the very beginning not out of cultural incompatibility, but rather out of power disputes. During British imperial rule, the tensions between the two groups worsened. The CIA suggested in 1985 that the Sinhalese community felt threatened by the Tamil group s prosperity partly due to the British favoritism of Tamils during the British occupation of Sri Lanka. Because Tamil communities also existed in several other British colonies like India, South Africa, and Singapore, Sri Lankan Tamils benefited from broader commercial networks and a wider range of opportunities. Moreover, British colonial authorities often placed English language schools in predominantly Tamil areas, providing Tamils with more civil service and professional opportunities than their Sinhalese counterparts. This pattern of Tamil favoritism left Sinhalese people feeling isolated and oppressed. Despite the tension between these groups before British colonization, the events that followed Sri Lankan independence suggest that imperial rule had provoked the ensuing conflict. Indeed, soon after British occupiers left the island in 1948, these patterns of Tamil dominance changed dramatically. The Story Reverses After British independence, many Sinhalese worked their way into the upper echelons of government. These Sinhalese gained power and went on to gradually pass acts effectively disenfranchising their Tamil counterparts. One such act was the Sinhala Only Act, a 1956 bill that made Sinhala the only official language of Sri Lanka and created barriers for Tamil people trying to access government services or seeking public employment. Former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga frames the act, which her father passed, as a move to nurture and reclaim a Sri Lankan identity following an extended period of British rule. If Kumaratunga s statements about her father s legislation are sincere and accurate, her commentary may reveal that legislators at the time hoped to recover the dignity of their Sinhalese ethnicity that they felt was lost during British imperial rule not that they wanted to actively minimize Tamil culture. Retrospectively, though, the minimization of Tamil culture is precisely what the laws accomplished. Another pertinent policy was that of standardization, which aimed to provide more educational opportunities for disadvantaged Sinhalese students. The policy required Tamil students to achieve higher exam scores that their Sinhalese counterparts in order to be admitted Sri Lankan universities. Legislators created a program that resembled affirmative action for the Sinhalese, who lacked opportunities and were disadvantaged during British imperial rule. Yet, when coupled with the Sinhala Only Act, standardization took opportunities from Tamil students, several of whom had turned to educational avenues to compensate for their lack of professional civil service opportunities. Thus, this legislation passed by a Sinhalese-dominated government failed to level the playing field; instead, it tilted the odds in the other direction and effectively discriminated against Tamil students. Ostensibly, these ethnic frictions had roots in the social destabilization caused by British occupation, and had more to do with reclaiming Sinhalese power and dignity than to cultural tensions between the Tamils and Sinhalese. Even so, before long, a few militant Sri Lankan Tamils organized an insurgency. The War Itself Some Tamils responded to these discriminatory policies with the idea of Tamil Eelam, a separate state for Tamils. While the idea appears to be extreme, the two groups already lived in somewhat separate spheres of the country: the Sinhalese in Southern, Western, and Central Sri Lanka, and the Tamils in the Northern and Eastern parts of the island. Tamil Eelam aimed to formalize this existing geographic separation. The movement was built on the idea that Tamils and Sinhalese represented distinct ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. However, post-colonial thought would suggest that the underlying reasons for both Sinhalese and Tamil actions in the immediate post-colonial period were not due to untenable differences, but rather a desire for power across the country s communities and a feeling of frustration about the lack of opportunity caused by factors beyond the groups  control. Nonetheless, Tamils had mixed reactions to the concept of Eelam. While a handful of groups supported Tamil Eelam, only one prevailed: the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). LTTE destroyed other budding Eelam groups like the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) to become the  sole representative of the Tamils.  The conflict then escalated into civil war. The war officially began after a day of riots targeting Tamils in Colombo in July 1983, a month which has since been dubbed  Black July.  The fighting lasted just under three decades and ended in May 2009, when the Sri Lankan government announced that they killed the LTTE leader. LTTE was an uncompromising group inspired by Che Guevarra and his guerilla warfare tactics. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) soon labeled the LTTE a terrorist group after they initiated terror tactics including suicide bombers, the suicide belt, and female-led suicide attacks. The group even assassinated two world leaders: Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Indeed, the LTTE s activities extended beyond Sri Lanka s borders. However, LTTE was not the only perpetrator of heinous crimes during the Sri Lankan Civil War. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights determined that the Sinhalese-dominated government has also been implicated in war crimes such as the torture of war prisoners and citizen disappearances. In one notably brutal example, the government s forces murdered five Tamil students in the port city of Trincomalee. These conflicts, rooted in a quest for power and dignity, descended into brutal violence on both sides, and memories of this violence still haunt the country today. The Situation Now and the Protests Revisited Although the Civil War ended in 2009, the current situation in Sri Lanka has only partially improved. A large portion of the Tamil population remains displaced. While there are fewer political and civil rights issues, instances of torture and enforced disappearances persist even in recent years. Moreover, the Sri Lankan government often surveils and tracks people linked to LTTE. The Sri Lankan military still occupies predominantly Tamil areas designated as  high-security zones,  though to a lesser extent than during the war. The government s Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) targets mostly Tamils. In a more subtle sense, the Sri Lankan government continues to disenfranchise the Tamil community. Through the process of  Sinhalization,  for instance, Sinhalese culture has slowly replaced that of the Tamil population. Sinahlese monuments, road signs, street and village names, as well as Buddhist places of worship became more common in predominantly Tamil areas. These efforts have infringed upon, and in some cases even erased, the Tamil perspective on Sri Lankan history, as well as Tamil and Hindu elements of the country s culture. Photo by Agnieszka Kowalczyk / Unsplash Perhaps the conflict has devolved into an ethnic issue, but it did not start that way. It may not stay that way either. The Sri Lankan government has alienated the Tamil minority since the civil war ended, but, more recently, it has come to disappoint its Sinhalese constituency as well. The government's actions since the end of the civil war have become increasingly undemocratic for Tamils and Sinhalese alike. Its response to the Black Lives Matter protests, for example, was only the latest instance in which the government exercised an unprecedented amount of power. The Sri Lankan government began growing its power during the civil war a conflict that stemmed from ethnic tensions rooted in the legacy of British imperialism on the island. The government continues to expand its authority now many years later. What this means for the future of Sri Lanka is unclear. Still, one thing is for sure: even if the wounds caused by the Sri Lankan Civil War and its accompanying ethnic divisions heal, the country will remain haunted by much larger structural issues in its history and government. However, a unified citizenry in Sri Lanka could be a powerful tool in responding to its government s growing power. Ethnic unity on the island may be the key to a more secure future.",

        "title": "Forty years since the beginning of civil war in Sri Lanka",
        "content": "Forty years ago, in the last days of July 1983, Sinhala chauvinist thugs backed by the United National Party (UNP) government and security forces unleashed a pogrom against Tamils in Colombo and other areas of Sri Lanka. It triggered the 26-year communal war by successive governments against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Burned out Tamil businesses in the Pettha area of downtown Colombo, Sri Lanka on Aug. 1, 1983. More than 1,000 businesses and homes of Tamil's were destroyed in the racial riots. [AP Photo/JLR] The war took hundreds of thousands of lives Tamil, Sinhala and Muslim and devastated the living conditions of many more, mainly of the Tamil minority in the north and east of the island. The conflict came to a bloody end in May 2009 with the military crushing of the LTTE and the slaughter of tens of thousands of Tamil civilians. The protracted civil war contains important strategic lessons for the working class in Sri Lanka and internationally. Though the war ended 14 years ago, the political issues that led to the conflict have not been resolved and continue to fester. The carnage carried out against Tamils 40 years ago was triggered by the death of 13 Sri Lankan soldiers who were killed by the LTTE in an ambush on July 23, 1983. With the approval of the government, the military brought the bodies to Colombo the same day, furnishing the pretext for the anti-Tamil violence. Well-organised thugs armed with guns, explosives, axes, knives and sticks, and provided with electoral lists, targeted Tamil homes and businesses. The gangs acted with the full backing of the UNP government of President J.R. Jayawardene. Some ministers were implicated in organising and directing the attacks. The armed forces and police either participated directly in the violence, or turned a blind eye. Officially, the number killed was 300, but the real figure is at least a thousand. Hundreds of Tamil women were raped. More than 250,000 people were displaced. In Colombo s Welikada jail, 52 Tamil prisoners were massacred with the connivance of prison officials. Thousands of homes and shops owned by Tamils were burned and destroyed. President Jayawardene appeared on national TV on July 28 and justified the communal pogroms.  Because of the violence by the terrorists, the Sinhalese people themselves have reacted,  Jayawardene stated. He declared that the government had decided to proscribe organisations advocating the division of the country, adding that  this is the only way to appease the natural desire and request of the Sinhala people.  On August 4, the government enacted the sixth constitutional amendment banning political parties that did not take an oath of allegiance to the  unitary state  from entering parliament or local government bodies. Every state employee was ordered to take a similar oath on pain of dismissal. The North and East were formally declared war zones and  strategies for military operations  in these provinces were drawn up and initiated by army commander Major General Tissa Weeratunga. The 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom did not come out of the blue. Confronted with widespread opposition among workers to its open market policies, the Jayawardene government resorted to the reactionary stock-in-trade of the Colombo political establishment the whipping up of anti-Tamil chauvinism and violence to divide the working class. Sri Lanka was one of the first countries in the world to end the policy of national economic regulation and import substitution and adopt a free market program. Amid a deep economic crisis, the Jayawardene government that came to power in 1977 devalued the rupee and began to shut down or privatise state-owned enterprises, slash spending on essential social services and cut back price subsidies on basic food items such as rice and flour. The consequences for workers and the urban and rural poor were devastating and provoked a growing number of strikes and protests. In July 1980, public sector workers launched a general strike, demanding a 300-rupee wage hike, to which the government responded by sacking 100,000 employees. The strike was ultimately crushed after the main working-class parties the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), the Stalinist Communist Party (CP) and the centrist Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP) refused to wage a political struggle to bring down the UNP government. To counter the widespread opposition, Jayawardene escalated the anti-Tamil campaign that had already led to violent attacks throughout the island, including on Tamil workers in the plantation districts. More than 100 had been killed and nearly 100,000 had been forced to flee their homes. In June 1981, thugs mobilised from Colombo, with the support of security forces and the police, went on a rampage in the northern town of Jaffna, setting fire to the Jaffna Public Library, which had stored valuable books, including irreplaceable manuscripts. Then came the July 1983 pogrom and the war. The Jayawardene government s resort to anti-Tamil chauvinism can be traced to the foundations of the Sri Lankan state, formed after formal independence from British colonial rule in 1948. The ruling class had faced the development of class struggles in the final years of British rule following World War II, particularly by plantation workers, including general strikes in 1946 and 1947. One of the first actions of the UNP government that took power in 1948 was to abolish the citizenship and voting rights of hundreds of thousands of Tamil workers brought from India as indentured labour to work in the plantations. The aim was to divide the working class on ethnic lines and weaken it. However, the Trotskyists of the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India (BLPI), the Ceylonese section of the Fourth International, which had played a leading role in the general strikes, opposed the Citizenship Act and fought tenaciously for the unity of the working class. Colvin R de Silva [Photo: Wikipedia] In the parliamentary debate, BLPI leader Colvin R de Silva condemned the dangerous fascistic principle on which the Act was based, namely  that the state must be coeval with the nation and the nation with the race.  He warned that though the Tamils in the North and East had not been targeted by the Act, it was  not only a short but easy step,  once the racialist principle was adopted as the basis for the Sri Lankan state. The warning was rapidly confirmed. In 1953, the UNP government was brought to its knees by a profound economic and political crisis that had provoked a nation-wide hartal strikes and business closures that united working people across communal lines. The response of the ruling class was to turn to the newly formed Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), which came to power in 1956 on the basis of an openly Sinhala-chauvinist program dressed up with socialistic phrase-mongering. The SLFP-led government implemented its policy of making Sinhala the country s only official language, severely disadvantaging Tamils, including many public servants who lost their jobs. The roots of the civil war that erupted in 1983 lie not simply in the anti-Tamil chauvinism in which the Colombo ruling class is mired, but in the liquidation of the BLPI into the centrist LSSP in 1950 and the LSSP s subsequent political backsliding and adaptation to Sinhala populism and the SLFP. In 1964, the LSSP completely abandoned any adherence to socialist internationalism and joined the bourgeois SLFP-led government of Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike. The LSSP s great betrayal was aided and abetted by the revisionist tendency within the Fourth International led by Michel Pablo and Ernest Mandel that rejected the revolutionary role of the working class and sought to subordinate it to the Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, social democratic parties and bourgeois nationalist forces like the SLFP in countries such as Sri Lanka. The International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) was formed in 1953 in a break from the Pabloites to defend genuine Trotskyism. The LSSP s betrayal generated great confusion and disorientation within the working class. It opened the door for various petty-bourgeois radical groups based on communal politics. In the south, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was formed in 1966 on an eclectic mixture of Maoism, Castroism and Sinhala populism and gained a base among oppressed rural youth. In 1972, the SLFP-LSSP-CP coalition government brought in a new constitution, drawn up by attorney-general and LSSP leader Colvin R de Silva, that formally enshrined Buddhism as the state religion, along with the Sinhala-only language policy. It also enacted discriminatory measures against Tamils in public sector employment and for university entrance. Tamil youth in the north deserted the traditional Tamil bourgeois parties in droves and embraced various Tamil groups including the LTTE that advocated the armed struggle for a separate Tamil state. A group of youth who had opposed the LSSP s betrayal formed the Revolutionary Communist League (RCL), the predecessor of the Socialist Equality Party, in 1968, as the Sri Lankan section of the ICFI. RCL General Secretary Keerthi Balasuriya addressing an RCL meeting in early 1970. Tragically, Comrade Balasuriya died in 1987 at the age of just 39. The RCL alone championed the program of socialist internationalism, opposed all forms of communal politics and fought for the unity of the working class Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim. When conflict finally erupted in 1983, the RCL was the only party that consistently opposed the war, defended the democratic rights of Tamils and demanded the unconditional withdrawal of the Sri Lankan army from the North and East. The 26-year war is an indictment against the Sri Lankan ruling class and a confirmation of Leon Trotsky s Theory of Permanent Revolution. Trotsky demonstrated that the bourgeoisie in countries of belated capitalist development are organically incapable of meeting the democratic and social aspirations of the masses. That task falls to the working class as part of the struggle for a workers  and peasants  government to implement socialist politics and the fight for socialism internationally. The war also graphically exposed the LTTE s separatist policy that sought to carve out a separate state of Eelam in the North and East of the island with the support of India. Despite its various socialistic phrases, the LTTE s call for a separate state represented the interests of the Tamil bourgeoisie that sought an arena to profiteer from the exploitation of Tamil workers. The LTTE s promotion of illusions in the Indian bourgeoisie was exposed in July 1987 when the Indian government reached an agreement the Indo-Lanka Accord to bail out the crisis-ridden Jayawardene regime. The LTTE backed the Accord under which India sent  peace-keeping  troops into northern Sri Lanka to disarm Tamil armed groups on the promise of limited provincial autonomy. The Accord allowed Jayawardene to send his army to crush the rural unrest in the south. The LTTE s support for the Accord reflected deeper processes internationally that were undermining so-called national liberation movements. The globalisation of production in the 1980s had undermined all programs based on national economic regulation, most clearly revealed in the collapse of the Stalinist regimes in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The LTTE increasingly dropped its socialist window dressing and anti-imperialist rhetoric and turned to the major powers to assist in setting up a separate state where foreign capital could exploit cheap Tamil labour. As part of the broader discussion in the ICFI, the RCL, which had advocated the  right of self-determination for the Tamil people,  as a means of unifying Tamil and Sinhala workers, concluded that the slogan no longer had any progressive content. While continuing to demand the immediate withdrawal of Sri Lankan armed forces from the North and East, our party advanced the call for a Sri Lanka-Eelam Socialist Republic as part of a Union of Socialist Republics in South Asia and internationally. While the communal war dragged on until 2009, the LTTE s separatist perspective resulted in its increasing isolation. It blamed the Sinhala masses for the crimes of the Sri Lankan military and attacked innocent Sinhalese people, which only strengthened the hand of the Colombo government. In the North and East, the LTTE increasingly alienated Tamil working people through its oppressive and anti-democratic rule. The LTTE s defeat was not just a military catastrophe but demonstrated the bankruptcy of its political program. As the Sri Lankan military closed in for the kill, the LTTE was incapable of appealing to the working class in Sri Lanka, let alone India and internationally, for support. Instead, it continued to issue futile appeals to the  international community that is, to major powers such as the US and India which had been backing Colombo s war politically and militarily. None of the issues of the protracted civil war have been resolved. The Sri Lankan army maintains its heavy-handed occupation of the North and East, the basic democratic rights of Tamils continue to be trampled on, and, amid an unprecedented economic crisis, communal tensions are again being whipped up. The government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe is implementing harsh austerity measures dictated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It is facing widespread opposition and unrest among workers and the rural masses Sinhala and Tamil alike. In a desperate attempt to stabilise his government, Wickremesinghe is seeking the support of bourgeois Tamil parliamentary parties by offering greater power-sharing for provincial councils. Anti-Tamil communalism has immediately raised its ugly head in Colombo. Sinhala chauvinist groups have already launched a campaign denouncing Wickremesinghe for preparing to divide the country by giving more power to the Tamils. In early August, the former army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Jagath Dias, addressed a Sinhala chauvinist gathering at a Buddhist centre in Colombo, where he claimed that  a plan is underway to help establish Eelam by constitutional means.  The Island, which reported the meeting and is notorious for boosting Sinhala chauvinist groups, declared that Dias would spearhead a campaign against greater provincial autonomy. Another Sinhala extremist group, the National Freedom Front, has accused Wickremesinghe of seeking the  Indianisation of the country  through its economic agreements with New Delhi. Sagara Kariyawasam, secretary of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), on which Wickremesinghe relies for parliamentary support, has warned the president against prioritising discussions on more powers to provincial councils. The whole history of Sri Lanka, particularly the brutal civil war that devastated the island, constitutes a sharp warning to the working class that its class interests for decent, well-paid jobs, social services and living conditions cannot be met through divisive communal politics. Instead, what is desperately needed is a unified struggle of workers, mobilising the downtrodden rural toilers, against the capitalist system and all its defenders, including the trade unions. The Socialist Equality Party calls on workers to form their own democratically elected action committees, independent of all capitalist parties, in every workplace and rural area to fight for their basic democratic and social rights. We are campaigning for a Democratic and Socialist Congress of Workers and Rural Masses based on the representatives of the action committees to take up the fight for a workers  and peasants  government to abolish all forms of communal discrimination, repressive laws and to implement socialist policies.",

        "content": "Perhaps the most informative and convenient way to get around is on the new double decker City Sightseeing bus, launched in February 2013, which delivers historical commentary as it travels the streets of downtown Jo burg and beyond. Make sure to stop off at Constitution Hill: today, this is the site of the South African Constitutional Court, but visitors will also learn about a rather less cheery era in the country s history. Its Old Fort is a former prison that operated from pre-Boer War times in the late 19th Century and throughout the apartheid era until its closure in 1987. Mandela spent short stints here in 1956 and 1962 while awaiting trial, and although the cells he occupied have since been demolished, a recreated one contains a permanent exhibition documenting his stay both here and on Cape Town s Robben Island, largely through correspondence written during his incarceration. The one-time prison also offers a chilling look at the apartheid regime, where deep racial inequalities permeated even the penal system. The sightseeing bus then takes you on an equally emotional ride to the excellent Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg South, where the exhibition is as superbly moving as it is distressing. Understanding the political system that ruled South Africa from 1948 to 1994 is essential to understanding Mandela himself, and a couple of hours spent walking through recent history will help untangle the extent of the complex web of laws that segregated every aspect of South African society. Throughout the 1950s and  60s, Mandela s home was a simple dwelling on Vilakazi Street in Soweto, a thriving suburb 30km southwest of Johannesburg   though his underground political activities meant that he spent little time here with wife Winnie and their two daughters. Today, the house is preserved as a museum, and while the information panels go a long way to explaining this era in Mandela s life, it is the impassioned guided tours that make this a must-see stop. In those final years before his lengthy incarceration (1962 to 1990), Mandela also spent time in a farmhouse 28km to the north of the city. In the 1960s, Liliesleaf Farm was the headquarters of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the then-banned ANC. Today it has been transformed into a magnificent museum, where interactive exhibits draw visitors into a fascinating chapter in South African history. Information is abundant, so be sure to set aside half a day to fully appreciate the role that Liliesleaf played in the resistance movement. Cape Town and around: Imprisonment and freedom (1964 to 1990) After the Rivonia Trial, which began with the Liliesleaf raid in 1963 and wrapped up in 1964, in which 10 leaders of the ANC were tried for acts of sabotage designed to overthrow the apartheid system, Mandela was moved to Robben Island, South Africa s answer to Alcatraz. Lying 7km off Cape Town s coast, the island served as a jail, a leper colony and a World War II fortification before returning to its roots in 1961 as a maximum security prison with virtually no chance of escape. Today the building is a museum, and it s is one of the main attractions in a city awash with activities and sights. Board a ferry at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront for the half day trip that takes in the choppy seas, tours the island and makes an all-important stop at the cell that held prisoner 46664 for much of his 27 years behind bars. Towards the end of his incarceration, Mandela was moved between prisons in the Cape. Both Pollsmoor Prison and Drakenstein Correctional Centre (formerly Victor Verster Prison) remain in use, and the latter, 70km east of Cape Town in the Winelands, is worth a visit. It is here that Mandela spent his final days of imprisonment and where the memorable scenes of him walking free for the first time in almost three decades were shot. A bronze statue of the great man, hand raised in triumph, commemorates the moment. If you re lucky, you might find a warden to take you on a quick unofficial tour of the cottage where he spent his final years of captivity. Back in Cape Town, there is one more sight to see: the Edwardian City Hall facade overlooking Grand Parade. This large square is home to a daily bustling market, but on 11 February 1990, thousands gathered in this spot to hear Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela speak from the balcony as a free man for the first time in more than 27 years. Visit on a Sunday when the square is quieter and ponder the life of a man who epitomised forgiveness and reconciliation, and inspired not only a nation, but the rest of the world as well.",

In the autumn of 1608, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, the most original Italian painter of the 17th Century, was on the run. Tempestuous and arrogant, Caravaggio was forever getting into brawls. He swaggered about with a sword at his side and once flung a plate of scalding artichokes in the face of a waiter, supposedly because some of them were cooked in butter rather than oil. Yet even by his own combustible standards two years earlier he had crossed a line, when he killed a man in a quarrel over a gambling debt at a tennis match. Before he could be charged with murder, he fled Rome and spent the rest of his short life as a fugitive from justice. That autumn in 1608, following spells in Naples and Malta, he arrived in Sicily. He stayed on the island for around a year, sleeping fitfully with a dagger by his side, and painting several late masterpieces, including the Nativity with San Lorenzo and San Francesco.",

        "content": "Perhaps the most intact example of prior rule is the Kastro, a castle on Spiridonos street in Chora, the island s tiny modern-day capital. Built between the 12th and 13th Centuries during a period of Venetian occupation, the castle was once called  the eye of Crete ; views from the top allow visitors to see the Ionian, Aegean and Cretan seas simultaneously. Today, the castle   the former residence of the Venetian governor   houses the historical archives of Cythera. Also in sight is the town of Kapsali, which served as the capital s port during Venetian times. Located just 2km south of Chora, Kapsali is characterised by a curved waterfront and sandy twin bays where sea turtles are known to swim. Kapsali is just one of many villages that dot Cythera s shoreline, with one of the most well known among locals being picturesque Avlemonas, a charming and historic hamlet situated some 18km northeast of Chora that you can reach by crossing Katouni Bridge. A reminder of British rule, the stone bridge  the largest of its kind in Greece at 110m long and 6m wide   was completed in 1826 as part of a project to ensure ease of travel between the seaside village and Chora   or so official records say. Legend has it that the construction was driven by desire: after Cythera s British governor fell in love with a girl from a nearby village, he decided to build this bridge near her house in order to see her daily. Another large relic backed by lore is the Panagia Myrtidiotissa monastery, the largest in Cythera. Situated on the western side of the island near the village of Kalokerines, the monastery   which translates to  The Most Holy Virgin Mary of the Myrtle Trees    was built next to a myrtle tree where a shepherd, according to legend, found a holy icon of the Virgin Mary in the 14th Century. Pilgrims travel here to venerate the icon on 15 August s Feast of the Dormition and on 24 September, the day of its finding. The icon is the patron saint of all Kytherians and is on display in the monastery save for Easter, when there is a religious procession to transfer it to Chora. An island for nature lovers Whittled away by wind and sea, Cythera is generously composed of steep, rocky cliffs and deep bays   and all of these elements are on display in the lush village of Mylopotamos, situated approximately 13km northwest of Chora. Meaning  mill on the river  in Greek, the village was once home to 22 watermills used for grinding wheat. Today, only one renovated mill remains, situated near the island s notorious 20m waterfall, Neraida, which is a fount of folklore. Also known as Fonissa ( female killer ), the waterfall was reputedly the site of a murder: legend has it that two women were fighting atop the waterfall when one pushed the other over the edge. Many hiking paths originate by the Neraida waterfall and loop through the village, incorporating a variety of cultural and scenic elements that illustrate Cythera s combination of natural beauty and historical significance. Hikers can follow one such monopati (a one-person path often used for donkeys)   recently signposted with numbers and arrows   that loops 2.6km past ruins of old mills and back to the town, though the more intrepid can choose to break away from the path before it loops back up and descend 2.2km down steep rocks and through the gorge to Kalami Beach, which can only be reached on foot by climbing down the rocks or through the gorge. Another scenic hike starts in the cypress forests of Lourantianika, in the island s southern region, and passes 4.6km through wild olive trees while affording spectacular views of Chora, the Kastro and the sea. Such discoveries of isolated beauty remain standard on Cythera, said Fivos Tsaravopoulos, programme coordinator of the Kythera Hiking Project, an organization centred around the creation of trails and sustainable tourism on the island.  Cythera is a small paradise for walking,  he said.  It combines incredible landscapes   forests, waterfalls, cliffs, gorges, beaches and a Mediterranean desert   and picturesque villages, beautiful churches on the top of mountains and an incredible amount of wildflowers.",

        "content": "Absinthe has inspired many great authors of the last 150 years   and may have ruined some as well. Jane Ciabattari investigates the green spirit s peculiar power. Arthur Rimbaud called absinthe the  sagebrush of the glaciers  because a key ingredient, the bitter-tasting herb Artemisia absinthium or wormwood, is plentiful in the icy Val-de-Travers region of Switzerland. That is where the legendary aromatic drink that came to symbolise decadence was invented in the late 18th Century. It s hard to overstate absinthe s cultural impact   or imagine a contemporary equivalent. The spirit was a muse extraordinaire from 1859, when  douard Manet s The Absinthe Drinker shocked the annual Salon de Paris, to 1914, when Pablo Picasso created his painted bronze sculpture, The Glass of Absinthe. During the Belle  poque, the Green Fairy   nicknamed after its distinctive colour   was the drink of choice for so many writers and artists in Paris that five o clock was known as the Green Hour, a happy hour when cafes filled with drinkers sitting with glasses of the verdant liquor. Absinthe solidified or destroyed friendships, and created visions and dream-like states that filtered into artistic work. It shaped Symbolism, Surrealism, Modernism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and Cubism. Dozens of artists took as their subjects absinthe drinkers and the ritual paraphernalia: a glass, slotted spoon, sugar cubes   sugar softened the bitter bite of cheaper brands   and fountains dripping cold water to dilute the liquor. Absinthe was, at its conception, not unlike other medicinal herbal preparations (vermouth, the German word for wormwood, among them). Its licorice flavor derived from fennel and anise. But this was an aperitif capable of creating blackouts, pass-outs, hallucinations and bizarre behaviour. Contemporary analysis indicates that the chemical thujone in wormwood was present in such minute quantities in properly distilled absinthe as to cause little psychoactive effect. It s more likely that the damage was done by severe alcohol poisoning from drinking twelve to twenty shots a day. Still, the mystique remains. Muse in a bottle",

        "content": "After 700 years, Lalibela s 11 Unesco-listed churches may be meeting their greatest foe: travellers. After the 1991 fall of dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam made Ethiopia more amenable to visitors, hardy tourists started to make their way to the remote town of Lalibela, perched in Ethiopia s Lasta mountains at 2,600m. The town is home to 11 medieval rock-cut churches so revered, Unesco included them on the original World Heritage list in 1978   a list of then only 12 sites, which now has grown to 981. Yet as more travellers have followed, some are starting to worry that increased commercialisation is eroding the area s unique atmosphere. According to local history, Lalibela s churches were the grand project of early 13th-century King Lalibela, although archaeologists believe that some of the churches, including the imposing Bet Gebriel-Rafael and the nearby Bet Mercurios, were built five centuries earlier, under the rule of the Axumite Empire. Arguably the most spectacular of Lalibela s churches is Bet Giyorgis (St George). The church lies in a hole some 15m deep, putting its cruciform roof roughly at ground level. Giyorgis has no bricks, no blocks, no evidence of joins. Instead, the church is carved out of a single solid piece of pink rock. The 13th-century labourers who built it dug down into an outcrop, carving a trench around a single massive block, and then hewed the church from that monolith. Visiting the church may be a priceless experience, especially in mid-January during Timkat (Epiphany), when thousands of Ethiopian white-clad worshippers, as well as tourists, descend on the churches. But tourists have been grumbling since the fee to see the churches tripled in 2013 from 350 birr to 950 birr, a ticket that covers all 11 churches and is good for four days.  It was a shocker,  said Priscilla Champaneri, who was visiting from New Zealand.  I was thinking it would be $20 (385 birr) maximum.

        "title": "Does Sigmund Freud still matter?",
        "content": "Psychoanalytic theory has changed a lot in the 75 years since his death, but literature still feels the strong influence of Freud's ideas, argues Jane Ciabattari. Freudian slips. The Oedipus complex. The ego. The id. The superego. Sigmund Freud s writings changed how we perceive human behaviour. The founder of psychoanalysis pioneered insights into perhaps the original unreliable narrator   the self   and opened the pathway toward increasingly complex literary characters with motives beyond the obvious.  Every dream will reveal itself as a psychological structure, full of significance, and one which may be assigned to a specific place in the psychic activities of the waking state,  Freud wrote in his landmark book, The Interpretation of Dreams, published in 1899. From the beginning, his work was intertwined with the canonical literature of his time. He drew upon Sophocles, Goethe s Faust and Shakespeare   especially Hamlet, King Lear and Macbeth   to explicate his understanding of unconscious motivations and the complex metaphors and displacements of dreams. He used the language of poets and novelists to outline irrational behaviour, pioneering concepts we have come to think of as commonplace. To begin to understand Freud s enduring impact on literature today, it is illuminating to trace the parallels between his writings and the work of his literary contemporaries. Peer pressure and praise  When I read one of your beautiful works I keep finding, behind the fiction, the same propositions, interests and solutions that are familiar to me from my own thoughts,  Freud wrote to Arthur Schnitzler, whose sexually explicit work, including the 1897 play Reigen (best known as La Ronde) was banned in Austria for nearly a quarter century. Schnitzler was, like Freud, trained as a neurologist in Vienna. And he was familiar with The Interpretation of Dreams. Schnitzler s fiction includes dreams, Freudian symbols (mountains, lakes) and stream-of-consciousness, modelled on the  free association  Freud describes in Studies on Hysteria (1895). Freud also corresponded with Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig, who noted in his 1931 biographical essay about the psychoanalyst,  Twenty years ago, Freud s ideas were still thought of as blasphemous and heretical. Today they circulate freely and find expression in ordinary linguistic usage.  Freud s psychoanalytic theories and emphasis on the unconscious have shaped decades of conflicted characters. His theory of the Oedipus complex underpins many a literary work, from the incestuous relationship between Paul Morel and his mother in DH Lawrence s 1913 novel Sons and Lovers to the present. Freud s work with traumatised World War I soldiers led to Beyond the Pleasure Principle, which fed into the character of Septimus Smith in Virginia Woolf s Mrs Dalloway (1925). The modernist poet HD sought out Freud in 1933 when she was suffering from writer s block, triggered in part by her dread of another devastating world war. Her 1956 book, Tribute to Freud, is a memoir of her psychoanalytic treatment. Critical analysis Freud s theories also have inspired literary critics for more than a century. In the 1940s, Lionel Trilling noted the  poetic quality  of Freud s principles, which, he wrote, descended from  classic tragic realism  a view which does not narrow and simplify the human world for the artist, but, on the contrary, opens and complicates it . Postmodernism, Structuralism and Post-Structuralism   including the work of French theorists Claude Levi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Julia Kristeva   all have roots in Freud s thinking. Susan Sontag argued against Freud and for an  erotics of art  in her 1964 essay Against Interpretation. Harold Bloom applied Freud s Oedipus complex to rivalries among poets and their precursors in his The Anxiety of Influence (1973), an approach given a feminist slant by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in Forward into the Past: The Complex Female Affiliation Complex (1985). Peter Brooks mined Freud s dream-work for ideas of how novels are plotted in Reading for the Plot (1992). Freud s influence continues in the 21st Century. But today he is as likely to turn up as a character as a theoretical catalyst. Recently we ve seen postmodern feminist novels such as the European Union Award-winning Freud s Sister by Goce Smilevski, translated from the Macedonian by Christina E Kramer (2012). This novel fictionalises the melancholy tale of Freud s youngest sister Adolfina, who perished in the Theresienstadt concentration camp (four of Freud s five younger sisters died in the Nazi death camps). Karen Mack and Jennifer Kaufman s historical romance Freud s Mistress (2013) spins a tale out of Freud s alleged affair with Minna, his wife Martha s younger sister. The producers of Downton Abbey have a TV series in the works called Freud: The Secret Casebook, set in fin de si cle Vienna, positing Freud as the first  profiler , and delving into his own  tangled and provocative personal life , Variety reported April 16. Mental detective Freud s case studies, crafted as stories or novellas, have yielded endless bounty for fiction writers. The studies are rich texts to be questioned, critiqued, studied, imitated, modified and fictionalised. One of Freud s best known case studies, described in his 1905 Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria, involves a young woman with limb pains and a hysterical loss of voice, whose symptoms Freud sees as displacements of sexual feelings rooted in childhood memories. Lidia Yuknavitch s edgy 2012 novel Dora: A Headcase, places Dora   whose real name was Ida Bauer   in contemporary Seattle with an analyst she calls Siggy.  I first read Freud s famous case study on hysteria based on his client Ida Bauer when I was in my 20s,  Yuknavitch told The Rumpus.  It pissed me off so badly it haunted me for 25 years. But I had to wait to be a good enough writer to give Ida her voice back.  The Dora case is also the basis of Sheila Kohler s new novel Dreaming for Freud. A beautiful 17-year-old patient is taken to Freud by her father.  He wants her to be more reasonable,  says Kohler.  He wants her to have an affair with his mistress s husband, but not to speak of it. She protests and she says the man has been after her since she was thirteen.  The girl finds Interpretation of Dreams in her father s library and decides to invent dreams to bring to Freud, feeding him fabrications in their sessions that appear in his later case study.  Freud s case studies are all written as mysteries, like Conan Doyle,  says Kohler, who has been teaching a class called Reading Freud's Great Case Histories as Short Stories at Princeton University this spring.  Each case study is a mystery. Each one he solves. Is he right? It doesn t really matter.  This mystery may, in the end, be the point. From his first publications, Freud s ideas were revolutionary and controversial. His followers   Carl Jung, Otto Rank, Alfred Adler, Karen Horney, Anna Freud, Melanie Klein and Erik Erikson among them   diverged from his original blueprint, extending and modifying psychoanalytic thought and practice to this day. Freud the author, awarded the 1930 Goethe prize for literature for his  clear and impeccable style , catalyst for innumerable other writers, may be as important as Freud the scientist. The highest measure of his meaning may derive from the echoes of his voice in artistic work. Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

        "content": "Why is one of Edinburgh's best views still off limits? 1 day ago Share Save Andrew Picken Share Save A look at Edinburgh's Radical Road which has been closed since 2018 It offers one of the iconic views of Edinburgh that has been celebrated in books and paintings for centuries. But access to the city's Radical Road path - set high along cliffs at Arthur's Seat, the extinct volcano that is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks - has been blocked since 2018. This was when 50 tonnes of rock fell from the cliffs, known as the Salisbury Crags, on to the path. The Radical Road was fenced off and years of rancour and indecision about reopening it have followed. Stretching for less than a mile in length, the Radical Road packs a lot in when it comes to rich history and stunning views of Scotland's capital. It overlooks the Scottish Parliament and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where senior royals stay when they visit Edinburgh. The path got its name from the unemployed west of Scotland weavers who were set to work paving a track around Salisbury Crags - a plan suggested by author Sir Walter Scott in the aftermath of the Radical War of 1820. It also contains the location where the founder of modern geology James Hutton arrived at his theory of how and when the world was formed. Why is the Radical Road closed? HES Some of the 50 tonnes of rock which fell from Salisbury Crags in 2018 Rockfalls on a narrow rocky path that clings to the side of a giant slab of dolerite rock are, unsurprisingly, not a new issue. The Radical Road has been regularly temporarily closed after significant volumes of rockfall over the last century, including a 100-tonne fall in 2011. The path was temporarily shut on five occasions in the two years before the 50-tonne fall in late 2018 sparked the current closure. At the time, park operator Historic Environment Scotland (HES) did not have an established policy on categorising what levels of rockfall risk would be considered acceptable. This was produced six years later and shows that three section of the Radical Road - the ones where it is at its narrowest below Salisbury Crags - currently present an unacceptable risk to the public. Why Edinburgh's best view has been hidden for seven years The section with the highest and intolerable risk has an estimated probability of a fatality from a rockfall event of one in 4,886. This compares with one in 95,435 for the section with a tolerable risk, where the rockface is set much further back from the path. Fairhurst, an engineering firm used by HES, also argues that its work elsewhere in the park has led it to conclude the \"number of actual rockfalls is higher than the number that is identified and reported in all areas \". What has been the impact of the closure? HES bills Holyrood Park as the \"most important open public space in the city\" so closing one of its most popular paths has had a big impact. The Radical Road itself has become overgrown without usage for years but HES says the wider path network is now \"highly degraded\" from the pressure of user numbers outweighing the capacity of the paths. Closures due to rockfalls elsewhere in the park, as well as wildfires, have not helped. HES does not have an up-to-date handle on how many people are using the park but an estimate from 2016 suggests more than two million visits a year. The 14 rangers who help manage the park are busier than ever. They dealt with 314 incidents, such as missing persons or fires, in 2023 - up from 162 incidents in 2018. HES Fences and warning signs greet visitors to the start of the Radical Road path At points the overgrowth nearly stretches across the whole path What needs to happen to reopen the Radical Road? Engineering firm Fairhurst first presented HES with options for long-term rockfall mitigation in 2019. It was asked to revise them in February last year to reflect the new rankings of what levels of rockfall risk would be considered acceptable. This report shows that to reopen the Radical Road the majority of the 0.8 miles (1.3km) route will need some form of engineered rockfall fence and netting. This would be similar to the measures in place on the rockface below Edinburgh Castle. Getty Images Steel netting has been in place on the rockface below Edinburgh Castle for years due to the risk of rockfall Other wider sections of the Radical Road would have a sloped earth embankment built to catch any rockfall. Fairhurst suggest this earth bund would need a fence on top to stop people getting in to the rock trap area. The firm's 2024 report estimates all of these remediation measures could cost up to  2.4m. Ranger-led guided walks in some sections of the Radical Road are available but a bigger step in the right direction for campaigners will come next year with a planned partial reopening. The areas marked in red are considered to present an unacceptable risk to the public of a fatality from rockfall Under the plan, the path between an area called The Hawse to the northern end of South Quarry would be open again. This will allow full access to the areas where James Hutton pioneered his theory that the Earth's age could be calculated using observations of volcanic rock. Edinburgh-based geologist Angus Miller, said: \"It's great that we are going to get access to the most geologically important features of the Radical Road but it has taken far too long. \"I don't think there has been an appreciation of what the route means to people and the impact of its closure on the wider park.\" Ramblers Scotland director Brendan Paddy said: \"After years of dithering, delay and broken promises, HES bosses must now stop kicking the can down the road. \"They must publish clear plans showing how they will reopen the 200-year-old Radical Road and boost the wider Holyrood Park path network - then urgently crack on with delivering trails worthy of this world-famous heritage site.\" Getty The dolerite rock of Salisbury Crags was quarried for use as cobble stones until it was outlawed in the 19th Century",

        "content": "Tutankhamun: How Englishmen uncovered the boy-king 1 day ago Share Save Ethan Gudge South of England Share Save Griffith Institute/Harry Burton Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered almost wholly intact in 1922 A century ago, the mummified body of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun was unwrapped for the first time - having been entombed thousands of years before. To mark the hundred-year anniversary, a new database containing thousands of personal records and documents from the time has been opened at the University of Oxford - making them fully accessible for the first time. The tomb of the former boy-king was discovered in 1922 by English archaeologist Howard Carter and his patron Lord Carnarvon from Hampshire. And between 11 and 19 November 1925, the pharaoh's body was meticulously unwrapped in a heavily symbolic and well documented process. It was on 26 November 1922 that Howard Carter held up a candle to peer through a tiny breach chiselled in a doorway sealed for three millennia. His partner and financial backer, Lord Carnarvon, waited anxiously nearby. The tale of the pair's incredible archaeological discovery, after years of digging in Luxor with little to show for it, enthralled the world. Getty Images Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter were the two \"unlikely Englishmen\" who discovered the tomb Lord Carnarvon has often been portrayed as merely Carter's patron but \"without him we probably would not have found the tomb of Tutankhamun\", the current Lady Carnarvon explained. She owns and runs the family's ancestral seat at Highclere Castle, in Hampshire, alongside her husband, Lord Carnarvon's great-grandson the eighth Earl of Carnarvon. \"He's often misrepresented today,\" she said of Lord Carnarvon. \"People say he's just a one dimensional financier - far from it.\" \"He was a great traveller, a restless man, and he was always trying to find something else, which I think is innate in all of us,\" she explained. \"He spent the winter months out in Egypt, he became very adept - he wasn't a trained Egyptologist, but nor was Howard Carter.\" \"It was two unlikely Englishmen in some ways, but their resilience, passion, obsession, and obviously his money, led to the discovery of Tutankhamun.\" Getty Images Lady Carnarvon said her great-grandfather-in-law had been \"misunderstood\" Along with photographer Harry Burton, Carter and Lord Carnarvon meticulously documented the tomb's more than 5,000 objects. The collection, which includes thousands of photographs, drawings and notebook pages, was donated to the Griffith Institute, the centre for Egyptology at the University of Oxford, after Carter's death in 1939. \"These records show how the tomb looked like when it was discovered, so this shows you how Howard Carter and his team saw the tomb,\" Daniela Rosenow, manager of the Griffith Institute and Egyptologist, said. Now, for the first time, the records will be available to researchers and the general public on an easy accessible database created by the institute. \"We really hope this will nurture research on the objects, which is desperately needed,\" Ms Rosenow said. \"The tomb of Tutankhamun is still not that well published or studied, because it is not easy to access the actual objects.\" \"My hope is that much more will come out now everyone can search the records and do the research.\" Griffith Institute/Harry Burton It took a committee of experts nine days to unwrap the boy-king's body Lady Carnarvon, who has written a book on the subject, said the documents show the discovery had been the \"result of hard work... and of a really well planned concessions\". \"There was a plan, there was a strategy, but actually in some ways they found it against all the odds.\" And on that November day more than a century ago, Carter, Carnarvon and his daughter, Lady Evelyn, first climbed in to the perfectly intact tomb of the boy-king. Lady Carnarvon said her great-grandfather-in-law had tried to write about first seeing the chamber, but just said it was \"entirely surreal\". \"It was beyond anything they'd ever dreamt of,\" she said. The world's media went into frenzy over the discovery, with Carter and Carnarvon becoming world famous. Griffith Institute/Harry Burton Tutankhamun's burial mask was uncovered after millennia in situ Lady Carnarvon said she believes the interest in Tutankhamun comes from the \"totality of the treasures\". \"It is a window back in time, of a culture which spanned 5,000 years and created works of art and architecture, such as we probably haven't created in our own world after 2,000 years.\" Just months after the discovery, Lord Carnarvon died following a mosquito bite - with some in the media speculating that it was the result of a curse placed on the tomb of Tutankhamun. \"He sacrificed all that we can give,\" Lady Carnarvon said. \"You can read into it what you will.\" \"I think there's a lot we don't understand in this world and the next, however you choose to interpret our imagination and our consciousness,\" she added. Griffith Institute/Howard Carter Ms Rosenow said autopsy drawings done by Carter during the unwrapping were among her \"favourite archaeological records ever\" A beta version of the Oxford database launches on Tuesday, exactly a hundred years on from the unwrapping of Tutankhamun's mummy, and will showcase Carter's material from the de-mummifying process. \"We do have other royal mummies, but none before were found in their context, their tombs had all already been plundered in antiquity - this is the first and only time that a royal mummy had been discovered in situ,\" Ms Rosenow explained of the event's significance. \"This was all planned in a very scientific way, a committee of experts was gathered and it took them nine days to unwrap the body.\" She added: \"During these nine days, some of the most stunning archaeological records ever were produced.\" Getty Images The new Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo houses treasures from the tomb, including Tutankhamun's golden coffin The databases launch comes just weeks after the Grand Egyptian Museum fully opened in the shadow of the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza. Described as the world's largest archaeological museum, it is packed with some 100,000 artefacts - including the entire contents of Tutankhamun's tomb. \"You can now see all these objects carefully curated as individual masterpieces,\" Ms Rosenow said. \"But not everyone can travel to Egypt, and our database will give everyone around the world the sense of how the tomb originally looked.\" Once the database is completed, and the 5000 or so objects are inputted, Ms Rosenow said the next step was to create an interactive 3D digital model of the tomb as it was found. Tutankhamun Exhibition The Tutankhamun Exhibition in Dorchester gives visitors the chance to experience an exact replica of the tomb But in Dorchester, that is already a reality. The Tutankhamun Exhibition in the town gives visitors the chance to experience an exact replica of the tomb. Michael Ridley, the exhibition's director, said the showcase's journey from its original home at the British Museum had been an \"accident of history\". Struggles to find a suitable permanent home for the display eventually ended with the choice of a redundant church in Dorset's county town. It has remained there ever since, with more than two million people having visited it in that time. Mr Ridley said visitors came through the doors because Tutankhamun's story was \"in fact many stories\". \"It is about the discovery of treasure, it's because of the wonderful gold mask that covered the head of Tut's mummy, and because of the mystery of why and how this pharaoh died at the young age of 19,\" he said. Of the new database, Mr Ridley said its appeal was that \"documents are the raw material of history\". \"They combine with the evidence unearthed by archaeology to make sense of the past.\" Griffith Institute/Harry Burton Photographer Harry Burton meticulously photographed the de-mummifying process More than a century on from the discovery, the story of Tutankhamun and his uncovering after millennia still captivates and intrigues the world. \"I think it's like all the appeal of Rider Haggard, Indiana Jones and the missions that we set ourselves in life,\" Lady Carnarvon suggested on why interest remains. \"All of us are the same, and I think the ultimate desire we all have, a quest we all have, is for knowledge, or for treasure - and maybe knowledge is treasure.\" But Ms Rosenow suggested a different answer for the persisting interest. \"There's this mystery about this young man who died very unexpectedly, but also it's the amazing and beautiful objects,\" she said. \"They are visually striking and you learn so much about ancient Egypt, but also about this young person, Tutankhamun.\" \"Hopefully, a 100 years on, you can actually move away from the gold and the curse and look at the young man.\"",

It is called \"Alt for Norge\" - which translates as \"All for Norway\" - a saying which dates back to World War II, when Dumfries became known as the \"unofficial Norwegian capital\". Over recent years, the balcony of Dumfries Museum has been completely revamped with a focus on military history. People with links to both countries attended the recent launch of the new archive material on display celebrating the Scandinavian connection. A telegram thanking the people of Dumfries is part of the exhibition In 1940 Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany, which meant many people fled and ended up in Dumfries. Many were based in Troqueer and Rosefield Mills, where they built a thriving community. This included setting up a Norwegian Society, where they hosted events from Burns suppers, to language classes. There were also 200 weddings between Norwegians and people from Dumfries, which is why some tourists from Norway continue to travel to Dumfries, so they can see where their parents got married. A launch of the exhibition celebrating the Norwegian links was held at Dumfries Museum Judith Hewitt, curator of the exhibition, said one special item in the exhibition was a telegram sent from Buckingham Palace in 1945. \"It's from the King of Norway, King Haakon VII, and it's to the provost of Dumfries on the liberation of Norway,\" she explained. \"It's giving thanks to the people of Dumfries for all they did to liberate his country. \"For a time in World War II, Dumfries was known as the capital city of Norway because so many Norwegians were here - 3,000 of them.\" Judith said the skis were her favourite part of the exhibition She said another special item was also worth highlighting. \"There's a famous campaign that the Norwegian army were involved in during World War II and it was to stop the Nazis getting the atom bomb,\" she said. \"I was told a long time ago that we had a set of skis in the museum collection that was used in the campaign to blow up the heavy water plant (a place where atom bombs could be manufactured) before the Nazis reached it.\" Judith said that the skis used came from Dumfries, which meant that the Norwegian army was carrying this small link to the town through their mode of transport. The display includes two uniforms worn by Norwegian soldiers \"They're with a big display about The Heroes of Telemark film, which is based on the book Skis Against the Atom, and it's quite probable that these skis saved the world,\" she said. Other items included are two uniforms of Norwegian soldiers with the photos and diplomas of the men who wore them along with an explanation of their Dumfries connection. The exhibition will run until 1 February next year.",

The 3,000-year-old artefact currently resides in the Great Hall at Chiddingstone Castle in Edenbridge, and the plan is to move it down several flights of stairs in order to be with similar relics in another part of the building. There it will be placed into a bespoke, museum-grade display case to make it more accessible to visitors. Curator Naomi Collick said its new home would also \"help preserve it for decades to come\". The operation to move the coffin lid will take place on 27 November, in plenty of time for when the castle, now closed for winter, reopens to the public in March. Studies of the coffin lid in 2017 revealed its origins, with analysis of its badly faded hieroglyphs identifying the name of the person for whom it was made. The middle of a set of three nested wooden coffins, it belonged to a man called Irethoreru, who lived during Egypt's 25th dynasty (circa 760   656BC). It will now be placed in the castle's designated Egyptian Room to sit alongside the rest of the historic collection from that period.

The 5cm (2in) high jar is part of the Galloway Hoard - a collection described as one of the most important UK archaeological discoveries of the century. Decorated with a gold filigree - an intricate metalwork - experts say it resembles a perfume bottle. And a Latin inscription which translates as \"Bishop Hyguald had me made\" shows the vase likely had a religious function. When the jar was found it was wrapped in lengths of linen and placed in a silk-lined purse. Experts initially used 3D x-ray imaging to view the jar inside its wrapping without risking damaging the treasure. National Museums Scotland A Latin inscription is on the base of the jar The jar was then separated from its wrapping with painstaking care over a series of months. Due to these textile preservation methods, this is the first time the object has been available for public viewing. Dr Martin Goldberg from National Museums Scotland said: \"The rock crystal jar is one of the highlight objects from the Galloway Hoard. \"The jar was the subject of international attention when we first revealed the inscription, and it's great to be able to put it on display for the first time in Kirkcudbright.\" Due to gaps in 9th Century church records, it has not been possible to precisely identify Hyguald, but he was most likely a Northumbrian bishop. The inscription shows the clearest evidence that the hoard comes from a church or religious community in the early medieval kingdom of Northumbria. This included Dumfries and Galloway, and stretched all the way from Edinburgh to Sheffield. PA Media The Galloway Hoard was acquired by National Museums Scotland in 2017",

Work started in March to enhance the landmark, which has led to its removal from Historic England's at Risk Register. Rebecca Trimnell, from Gloucester City Council, said: \"I was delighted to see the archaeological team uncover part of the medieval wall around St Oswald's Priory, which is now visible for all to see.\" The site was built by Alfred the Great's eldest daughter and later became the resting place for the relics of the Christian martyr St Oswald. Small scale repairs to the stonework and improvements to the gravelled area have been carried out, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Jeremy Hilton, leader of the council, said: \"It needed some repair works and we just needed to make sure the structure was protected. \"Installing up-lighting really does help because it protects it from vandalism, particularly at night, which we were getting at periods of time.\" \"It has always been a wonderful historical landmark, but for many years it was looking very unloved,\" said Ms Trimnell. \"I am pleased to say with a lot of time and effort from a number of individuals it's now looking wonderful with new lights and new interpretation boards also installed.\" The local authority received grants of  20,000 from Historic England and  16,000 from the government's Shared Prosperity Fund to carry out the work, which includes improvements to the landscaping, new architectural lighting and CCTV cameras.

        "content": "Getty Images Garfield's inauguration ceremony in March 1881; he set out as President with an ambitious agenda (Credit: Getty Images) Makowsky's crucial task was to sift through Millard's detailed dive into the history of the assassination and construct a narrative appealing to TV viewers. Destiny of the Republic includes sections on Republican Party factionalism, the antiseptics preferred by British surgeon Joseph Lister and Alexander Graham Bell's invention of an early metal detector, used eventually to search for the bullet in Garfield's body. Makowsky chose to focus on the contrasting journeys of Guiteau and Garfield. \"Both men cared very much about being known,\" he said. \"One propels himself to the highest office in the land, whereas the other courts greatness and never achieves it.\" The killer's motivation By turns Guiteau failed as a lawyer, a journalist and an evangelical preacher. He even flopped at the free love commune he joined; no woman would sleep with him, as Millard recounts. Yet he always believed God intended him for a grand purpose. Guiteau became obsessed with Garfield after the congressman's unlikely nomination, and travelled to New York in the summer of 1880, determined to play a crucial role ensuring his victory in the general election. Guiteau harassed the staff at Garfield's New York campaign office until he was allowed to give a single rambling speech endorsing the candidate. Garfield vocally opposed the spoils system of handing out lucrative posts to supporters, yet Guiteau believed in it fiercely. He expected that, in exchange for his backing, Garfield, now president, would give him a key post. Ambassador to France was his first choice. The deluded man travelled to Washington, and appeared at the White House every day with hordes of other insistent office seekers. Guiteau even came face to face with his hero once, in the president's office, where he handed Garfield a copy of his election speech, with \"Paris Consulship\" scrawled on it, and a line connecting those words to his name. Garfield, meanwhile, embarked on an ambitious agenda for his presidency, including upgrading the US Navy, aiming to expand trade with Latin America, and advocating for civil rights. He appointed the once-enslaved social reformer Frederick Douglass as recorder of deeds for the District of Columbia, the first African American to hold a prominent federal office. At the same time, Garfield also had to face down Roscoe Conkling, Republican senator from New York, arguably the most powerful politician in the nation, thanks to his indirect control of the lucrative customs revenue flowing into the port of New York. Conkling didn't like Garfield's progressive instincts nor his opposition to the spoils system. He'd already imposed on candidate Garfield his associate Chester A Arthur, to be vice president. Now Conkling sought to block Garfield's Cabinet picks.",

        "content": "This French glacier has given rise to countless works of art in the past 200 years, including Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Paintings, photographs and modern satellites reveal how the site has dramatically transformed since Shelley was first transfixed by it. In the 1800s, above the town of the Chamonix in the French Alps, there was a sublime sight known as the \"sea of ice\" that provoked both awe and a touch of dread. Those who climbed up the mountain trails to see it would encounter an icy, barren expanse of white, dark blue and aquamarine. Visitors described a scene akin to a torrent of waves and whirlpools frozen in time; an unrelenting frost extending boundlessly into the mountains. Many artists at the time painted this icy sea, but one of the most striking images is an early photograph: a gloomy daguerreotype taken by an assistant of the writer John Ruskin in the 1850s (above). This was the \"Mer de Glace\" glacier   a mass of compacted snowfall, creeping down from the Mont Blanc massif. For centuries, it has remained the largest glacier in France, and was one of the first to be studied scientifically. Sadly, it has shrunk profoundly since then   more than 2.5km (1.6 miles) since the mid-1800s   and as I discovered following a recent visit, it is barely visible from the same point that the Ruskin photo was taken. The melting is accelerating, and by 2050, scientists anticipate it could retreat by at least 2km (1.2 miles) further, even with stringent emissions reductions.",

        "content": "Perhaps the most informative and convenient way to get around is on the new double decker City Sightseeing bus, launched in February 2013, which delivers historical commentary as it travels the streets of downtown Jo burg and beyond. Make sure to stop off at Constitution Hill: today, this is the site of the South African Constitutional Court, but visitors will also learn about a rather less cheery era in the country s history. Its Old Fort is a former prison that operated from pre-Boer War times in the late 19th Century and throughout the apartheid era until its closure in 1987. Mandela spent short stints here in 1956 and 1962 while awaiting trial, and although the cells he occupied have since been demolished, a recreated one contains a permanent exhibition documenting his stay both here and on Cape Town s Robben Island, largely through correspondence written during his incarceration. The one-time prison also offers a chilling look at the apartheid regime, where deep racial inequalities permeated even the penal system. The sightseeing bus then takes you on an equally emotional ride to the excellent Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg South, where the exhibition is as superbly moving as it is distressing. Understanding the political system that ruled South Africa from 1948 to 1994 is essential to understanding Mandela himself, and a couple of hours spent walking through recent history will help untangle the extent of the complex web of laws that segregated every aspect of South African society. Throughout the 1950s and  60s, Mandela s home was a simple dwelling on Vilakazi Street in Soweto, a thriving suburb 30km southwest of Johannesburg   though his underground political activities meant that he spent little time here with wife Winnie and their two daughters. Today, the house is preserved as a museum, and while the information panels go a long way to explaining this era in Mandela s life, it is the impassioned guided tours that make this a must-see stop. In those final years before his lengthy incarceration (1962 to 1990), Mandela also spent time in a farmhouse 28km to the north of the city. In the 1960s, Liliesleaf Farm was the headquarters of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the then-banned ANC. Today it has been transformed into a magnificent museum, where interactive exhibits draw visitors into a fascinating chapter in South African history. Information is abundant, so be sure to set aside half a day to fully appreciate the role that Liliesleaf played in the resistance movement. Cape Town and around: Imprisonment and freedom (1964 to 1990) After the Rivonia Trial, which began with the Liliesleaf raid in 1963 and wrapped up in 1964, in which 10 leaders of the ANC were tried for acts of sabotage designed to overthrow the apartheid system, Mandela was moved to Robben Island, South Africa s answer to Alcatraz. Lying 7km off Cape Town s coast, the island served as a jail, a leper colony and a World War II fortification before returning to its roots in 1961 as a maximum security prison with virtually no chance of escape. Today the building is a museum, and it s is one of the main attractions in a city awash with activities and sights. Board a ferry at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront for the half day trip that takes in the choppy seas, tours the island and makes an all-important stop at the cell that held prisoner 46664 for much of his 27 years behind bars. Towards the end of his incarceration, Mandela was moved between prisons in the Cape. Both Pollsmoor Prison and Drakenstein Correctional Centre (formerly Victor Verster Prison) remain in use, and the latter, 70km east of Cape Town in the Winelands, is worth a visit. It is here that Mandela spent his final days of imprisonment and where the memorable scenes of him walking free for the first time in almost three decades were shot. A bronze statue of the great man, hand raised in triumph, commemorates the moment. If you re lucky, you might find a warden to take you on a quick unofficial tour of the cottage where he spent his final years of captivity. Back in Cape Town, there is one more sight to see: the Edwardian City Hall facade overlooking Grand Parade. This large square is home to a daily bustling market, but on 11 February 1990, thousands gathered in this spot to hear Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela speak from the balcony as a free man for the first time in more than 27 years. Visit on a Sunday when the square is quieter and ponder the life of a man who epitomised forgiveness and reconciliation, and inspired not only a nation, but the rest of the world as well.",

In the autumn of 1608, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, the most original Italian painter of the 17th Century, was on the run. Tempestuous and arrogant, Caravaggio was forever getting into brawls. He swaggered about with a sword at his side and once flung a plate of scalding artichokes in the face of a waiter, supposedly because some of them were cooked in butter rather than oil. Yet even by his own combustible standards two years earlier he had crossed a line, when he killed a man in a quarrel over a gambling debt at a tennis match. Before he could be charged with murder, he fled Rome and spent the rest of his short life as a fugitive from justice. That autumn in 1608, following spells in Naples and Malta, he arrived in Sicily. He stayed on the island for around a year, sleeping fitfully with a dagger by his side, and painting several late masterpieces, including the Nativity with San Lorenzo and San Francesco.",

        "content": "Another issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive. The answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\" In History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.  to the accompanying weekly newsletter. This elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A 12.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\" The project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"",

        "content": "Vladimir Syromiatnikov's bold attempts to light up Siberia with a space mirror captured global attention. The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993. It sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993. But the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell. WATCH: 'On a clear night, it could illuminate an area the size of a football stadium'. Even today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one. Back in 1923, German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth had proposed it in The Rocket into Planetary Space. His self-published book   based on a PhD thesis which Heidelberg University had rejected for seeming too implausible   demonstrated mathematically how a rocket could leave the Earth's orbit. Among the other ideas covered in the publication were the potential effects on the human body of space travel, how satellites could be launched into orbit, and, crucially, the concept of creating a grid of colossal adjustable concave mirrors that could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the Earth. Oberth reasoned that this illumination could help avert disasters   like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912   or assist with the rescue of their survivors. Oberth also speculated that space mirrors could be used to clear shipping lanes by melting icebergs or even to manipulate the Earth's weather patterns.",

        "content": "Mary Poppins had long been something of a passion project for Walt Disney. In the early 1940s, he had promised his daughters, who were fans of the first book, that he would adapt it into a movie. But he had not counted upon its notoriously prickly author, Travers. He spent the next 20 years repeatedly trying to persuade her to sell him the screen rights. By the 1960s, despite Travers' serious misgivings about Disney's much more jolly, whimsical take on the darker elements of Mary Poppins, the author s increasingly dire financial situation forced her to relent. Despite author PL Travers describing Mary Poppins in the books as being very plain, Disney had a clear idea he wanted Andrews for the 'practically perfect in every way' nanny In 2013, Disney would depict their founder's fractious relationship with the intransigent Travers, and his efforts to bring the book to the screen, in the film Saving Mr Banks. In keeping with the author's fears about the adaptation of her own book, some critics claimed that the film portrayed a highly sanitised version of their antagonistic relationship, and the two complicated people involved. Despite Travers describing Mary Poppins in the books as being very plain, Disney had a clear idea about who he wanted for the \"'practically perfect in every way'\" nanny   and that was Julie Andrews. A fast-rising talent By this time, Andrews had already established a successful stage career on both sides of the Atlantic. Born in 1935, in Surrey, in the UK, Andrews' mother and stepfather, on discovering their daughter's exceptional singing ability and four-octave vocal range, propelled her towards a career on stage. By the age of 12, she was astonishing West End audiences in London with her clear, melodic soprano voice. In 1954, she made her US debut on Broadway in the immensely popular The Boy Friend, but it was her role as Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in the 1956 musical My Fair Lady that really brought her to people's attention. The production proved to be a perfect showcase for her talents   earning her a Tony Award nomination   and by 1958 was the highest-grossing Broadway show of all-time.",

Described by experts as the county's \"ancient sacred heart\", Castilly Henge is believed to have been built during the late Neolithic period - about 3,000 to 2,500 BCE (Before Common Era). More than  40,000 of National Lottery funding was awarded to Cornwall Heritage Trust (CHT) to excavate a hidden stone circle at its centre earlier this year. Carolyn Kennett, CHT's site project manager, said: \"Neolithic henges are incredibly rare, so this is a really exciting moment.\" Is there a Bronze Age stone circle in Bodmin? Located just off the A30 near Bodmin, the substantial oval embankment that makes up Castilly Henge is believed to have been once used as an amphitheatre-like setting for gatherings and ritual activities. Its significance continued into the Early Bronze Age (circa 2,400 to 1,500 BCE) when several high-status burial mounds or barrows were built close by. Previous researchers also suggested that the site might have been used as a medieval open-air theatre known as a plen-an-gwari, as well as fortified housing for cannons during the English Civil War. The four-week archaeological excavation, which is a collaboration between the CHT, Cornwall Archaeological Society and Historic England, aimed to delve deeper into the monument's backstory, project leaders said. Historic England & Cornwall Archaeology Unit A large team of volunteers and experts are working to excavate the site Possible traces of a long-vanished stone circle at the site were discovered in 2022, of which only one other example is known to survive in Cornwall. Ms Kennett said she hoped that the henge - which is at risk from invasive vegetation and nearby road infrastructure - could be saved for future generations. \"Our goal is to fundraise to purchase this site and to open it up to public,\" she said, adding that more than  10,000 of an overall  50,000 target had already been raised. Dr Olaf Bayer, senior archaeological investigator for Historic England, described the henge as offering a \"direct visceral connection\" to our ancestors. \"To discover and hold in your own hands the very tools people of the past had used - it's the kind of stuff that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck,\" he said.",

On 23 September, 1779, beneath Bempton Cliffs, a French and American fleet of four ships swooped in and attacked two British Royal Navy vessels that were escorting a convoy. The USS Bonhomme Richard, under the command of Scottish-born naval captain John Paul Jones, managed to capture the frigate HMS Serapis. The Battle of Flamborough Head, during the American War of Independence, is now one of the most celebrated naval actions in US history. To mark the 246th anniversary, a refurbished monument, known as a toposcope, will be unveiled on the cliff tops with markings pointing to the site of the battle. One of the organisers, Kim Hodgson, secretary of Yorkshire Coast 1779, said Jones is seen as \"the father of the US Navy\". \"They actually still teach the Battle of Flamborough Head to every midshipman that goes through their officer training,\" she said. \"They see him as a hero and so it is a very important battle for the Americans. \"It gave the Americans a boost that they could just about win the war because at the time America was not doing very well, they were suffering quite a few defeats over in the colonies, so this really gave them a boost of confidence. \"The Royal Navy was outnumbered two to one but they managed to protect the convoy, it was saved, but they did lose both their ships.\" Getty Images Scottish-born naval captain John Paul Jones is seen as the father figure of the US Navy According to the research group, more than 400 men and boys were killed and injured when Captain Jones captured the Serapis, with his own Bonhomme Richard later sinking. Ms Hodgson added: \"The Americans treat it as a battle that they won. They may have captured two ships but they didn't achieve their objective, which was to capture some of those supply ships. \"They got off with the two Royal Navy ships but they didn't achieve their objective, but the Royal Navy did. That's why we want to raise this significant event.\" Legend has it that when the two ships were side by side firing broadsides into each other the captain of HMS Serapis asked Jones if he was prepared to surrender, to which he reportedly replied \"I have not yet begun to fight\". The refurbished toposcope was first installed on Bempton Cliffs in 1959 The toposcope will be unveiled in the presence of the Lord Lieutenant of East Yorkshire, Jim Dick OBE, Michael Rice, High Sheriff of East Yorkshire, Charlie Dewhirst MP for Bridlington and the Wolds and Liam Dealtry, chairman of East Riding of Yorkshire Council. It was originally built in 1959 and has been refurbished and made more accessible. As well as arrows pointing to the site of the battle, panels will be installed giving more information about the skirmish, allowing visitors to \"look out to sea and reimagine this ferocious battle and what it must have been like for the terrified locals watching this\". Ms Hodgson said the monument was a \"really nice opportunity to remember our history and the significance of what the Yorkshire Coast played in that little bit of a historic timeline in 1779\". She added: \"Isn't it amazing that in 1779 we were fighting with each other, but over the course of the last 250 years we have been good friends, sometimes best friends and always managed to turn that relationship around.\" Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.

The piece of gilded silver jewellery was discovered by a metal detectorist at Carleton Rode, near Attleborough, Norfolk, earlier this year. Dr Natasha Harlow, an expert in portable Iceni objects, said it was quite a rare piece and was probably made in East Anglia. The brooch is going through the treasure process and Norwich Castle Museum is hoping to acquire it. \"It would have been very eye-catching, as it was made from silver and it was partly gilded, so it had these flashes of gold and silver,\" said Dr Harlow, who is an honorary research fellow at the University of Nottingham. \"[The Iron Age] would have been a very bright and colourful world to live in, which is not necessarily what we think of when we think of British pre-Roman history.\" Andrew Williams/Norfolk County Council Only 17 similar brooches have been found in Norfolk making then quite rare, said Natasha Harlow The find has been dated to between 30BC and AD60 and is reminiscent of other late Iron Age finds from Norfolk, she said. In particular, she pointed to three little pellet shapes at its base, which are seen in Iceni coins and horse metal work. The Iceni were a tribe occupying present-day Norfolk and Suffolk and are most famous for queen Boudicca, who led a revolt against the Romans. Dr Harlow said: \"In northern East Anglia, there is a regional distinctiveness to the settlements and we tend to see people showing their wealth and status through the small items they wore - it shows something about the wearer's importance and access to resources.\" This style of brooch is known as the Birdlip type, because the first one of its kind was found at Birdlip, near Gloucester. In a time before buttons and zips, brooches were also believed to have had a practical purpose, acting as safety pins to hold clothes together, Dr Harlow added. A coroner at a treasure inquest typically decides whether the discovery is treasure, and therefore whether a museum should have first refusal over it.

The Great Fire of Northampton destroyed 700 out of 850 buildings and claimed 11 lives within hours of starting on 20 September 1675. The anniversary has been commemorated with a series of events in the town over six months. But, what caused the devastating blaze and how did Charles II help with its rebuild? The BBC has been finding out. 'Densely packed and filthy' Joseph Ashmenall/BBC One of the few houses to survive the conflagration was Hazelrigg House, part of which did need rebuilding Northampton in 1675 was still essentially a medieval town, densely packed with lots of alleyways, having evolved in a random way over centuries, according to Alan Clark, an expert on the town's history. \"At the same time there was a population increase in what was a golden era of English market towns in terms of commercial activity, which meant the population density was such that properties were simply ramshackle, insalubrious and often filthy,\" he added. The vast majority of the buildings were thatched and built from timber frames with plaster walls imbedded with straw and horse hair - all highly flammable. Dr Clark said the local authorities were well aware of this, repeatedly urging people to maintain what fire precautions were in place. Meanwhile, conditions across the country were tinder-dry. \"[The year] 1675 is known for a terrible drought, which began in January and continued throughout the year,\" he said. \"So along with supplies like hay for horses and barrels of alcohol, it was a recipe for disaster,\" he added. 'Going up in a whoosh' Nick Moses/BBC James Miller (left) and Earl Spencer (right) have been researching the Great Fire of Northampton The fire is believed to have started accidentally on St Mary's Street, now Chalk Lane. Dr Clark said: \"It's reported that late in the morning of 20 September, a woman put a kettle on an open fire and left it unattended, so this is just a simple human occurrence - except that on this day a very stiff wind, blowing directly from the west, had been suddenly picking up in speed and strength. \"It may have contributed to the ignition of the fire at that lady's property and fanned those flames into and affecting other properties.\" An eyewitness riding past the town and bound for London would later describe the astonishing speed of the blaze that ripped through the town. Earl Spencer, who has has written several historical books and co-hosts a history podcast, said: \"I've read contemporary accounts that say the Great Fire of Northampton was more devastating than the Great Fire of London (1666) for its scale. \"You think of these quite compressed, highly combustible buildings going up in a whoosh.\" Trapped in the market square Joseph Ashmenall/BBC Many of the townsfolk fled to the safety of the market square - reportedly the largest in the Midlands - only to seek escape through the Welsh House (above) As the blaze began at about midday, people could grab some of their possessions and flee, said art historian James Miller, who worked on the town's anniversary events. \"They weren't in their beds, they knew it was coming and they all rushed to the large Market Square because they thought that would be quite safe,\" he said. But the square was packed with more combustible material, which also caught fire and \"whoosh off it went\" trapping them, he said. Just as they feared the worst, the terrified people discovered an opening at The Welsh House, in the square's north-eastern corner, enabling them to cross its grounds by the side of the property to make their escape. Meanwhile, the fire reached All Hallows Church, south of the Market Square, which supercharged the blaze. Dr Clark said: \"Its central crossing tower becomes a chimney and magnifies, radiates and increases the intensity of the heat and so the fire reignites and this then allows it to leap spaces and to spread and continue eastward to St Giles' Church.\" Then the weather that had helped whip up the conflagration, suddenly came to the town's aid. Mr Miller said: \"The next morning, a gale took place and it drenched the town - it had burnt down but within 36 hours, it was sodden and the fire was out.\" 'You should have seen the looting' Joseph Ashmenall/BBC All Saints' Church stands on the site of the burned-out All Hallows' Church and was built within five years of the devastating blaze Thousands of people were now without their homes - more than 80% of the town's properties were uninhabitable.

Dr Clark said it had taken five months to pass an Act of Parliament for London's rebuild and this set the foundations for helping destroyed towns and cities going forward. \"One of the first buildings to be constructed was the Sessions House in 1678, because it is regulating the economy, levying taxes and fines and reconstitution of law and order,\" he said. \"This mattered, because an anecdote from the time was, 'If you thought the fire was bad, you should have seen the looting'.\" Next to be rebuilt was All Saints' Church, constructed on the foundations of All Hallows and funded by the ecclesiastical authorities. Dr Clark said, for many people, the immediate impact of the blaze was devastating - \"exceptional poverty becomes rampant, people starve and are left impoverished\". 'An act of reconciliation' Getty Images Charles II (1660 to 1685) became one of the chief benefactors of the construction effort Leading local figures stepped in with offers of help. The Reverend Oliver Cross, the rector of All Saints' Church, said: \"The Earl of Northampton turned up the day after the fire and donated  150 for the immediate aid effort.\" Others who helped the rebuild efforts were chief justice Sir Richard Rainsford, who had experience working on the aftermath of the Great Fire of London, and Sir Roger Norwich. Prior to the fire, Charles II had pulled down Northampton's town walls to punish its people for Parliamentarian supporters during the English Civil Wars of the 1640s and 1650s. Father Cross said: \"It was only after the Great Fire that an incredible act of reconciliation took place between the Parliamentarian town and the crown, which meant Charles II became the chief benefactor of the construction effort.

One pilot tells BBC Future what it feels like to fly them. They are two of the most celebrated aircraft still flying today. The two Boeing B-29s flown by the Commemorative Air Force (CAF) in the US are the last airworthy examples of nearly 4,000 built in the mid-1940s, the largest bomber in the world at that time and a design which pushed aviation technology to the limit. The aircraft, nicked \"Fifi\" and \"Doc\" by the CAF, take part in airshows across the US during the summer, where aviation fans can pay to ride along in 30-minute-long demonstration flights. The Boeing B-29 was the most advanced bomber in the world when it entered service in 1945: it was the first mass-produced aircraft to have pressurised compartments for the crew, and it could fly higher and further than any other aircraft thanks to its four enormous engines. These engines also helped it fly almost as fast as the fighter planes of the time. Designing and building it cost more than the atomic bombs that B-29s would eventually drop on Japan to end World War Two. Bringing the B-29 into service was a colossal industrial project that at times overwhelmed Boeing. Its engines were powerful but temperamental, and keeping them in line required the full-time attention of a dedicated flight engineer, who kept a beady eye on engine temperatures to avoid the engines catching fire from overheating. Even getting a B-29 airborne for its mission over Japan required great effort in the humid air of tropical airfields. So, 80 years after the B-29 helped bring the world's most costly conflict to a close, what is it like to fly one now?",

        "content": "FBI returns stolen conquistador document to Mexico Cort s was an explorer who brought about the end of the Aztec empire and helped pave the way for the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. The manuscript details plans for his journey across what would become New Spain. The page - which describes payments made for supplies for expeditions - was discovered in the US and repatriated on Wednesday. The manuscript page was penned in 1527 and is one of 15 pages thought to have been swiped from Mexico's national archives between 1985 and 1993, the US investigatory agency said. The FBI has returned a 500-year-old stolen document signed by Spanish conquistador Hern n Cort s to Mexico. At its height, the colony stretched across much of western and central North America, and into Latin America. The previously missing document was written after Cort s had been made the governor of New Spain by the Spanish crown. Mexico's national archives had counted the document among a collection of papers signed by Cort s - but found 15 pages were missing when it was put on microfilm in 1993. The recovered page bore a number written in wax that archivists had applied in 1985-1986, suggesting it had been stolen between the two cataloguing periods. The Mexican government requested the assistance of the FBI's art crime team in finding the missing documents in 2024, providing notes on which pages had been taken and how certain pages had been torn. The FBI said open-source research revealed the document was located in the US. The agency did not reveal exactly where the manuscript page was found or who had owned it when it was seized. No one will face prosecution over the theft as the page had \"changed hands several times\" since it was stolen, according to Special Agent Jessica Dittmer of the FBI's art crime team. The document \"really gives a lot of flavour as to the planning and preparation for uncharted territory back then\", she said, outlining \"the payment of pesos of common gold for expenses in preparation for discovery of the spice lands\". The so-called \"spice lands\" were areas of eastern and southern Asia. Europeans sought to find a quicker trade route with these areas by sailing west, but in doing so landed on the Americas instead. Cort s would go on to explore north-western Mexico and the Baja California peninsula. The document's repatriation comes at a time of political tension between Mexico and the US over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and illegal migration across the US-Mexico border. But the FBI says that, as one of the largest consumers of antiquities, the US had a responsibility to counter the trafficking of artefacts. Ms Dittmer said: \"Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico's history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their archives for the purpose of understanding history better.\" The FBI said it was determined to locate and repatriate the other pages still missing from the collection. Another document signed by Cort s was returned to Mexico by the FBI in 2023.",

The 50-page document, codenamed Operation Nestegg, was discovered in a cardboard box in Derbyshire in the UK. Auctioneers Hansons described it as a \"piece of history\" before it went under the hammer earlier. The top guide price was  1,200 but the winning bid at the auction in Etwall was  3,800.

The document spelled out British plans for the liberation of the Channel Islands, including which beaches to land on. The plans were spread across numerous pages, some with lines crossed through, and others with annotations. Previously Matt Crowson, from Hansons, told the BBC: \"It's an incredible story - the document had been part of a dusty box of papers in a UK saleroom, the value of which was considered negligible. \"But on closer examination the vendor came across a piece of World War Two history detailing the freeing of the only Nazi-occupied area of the British Isles.\" The file was formerly the property of Sub-Lieutenant Walter Page, of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, who was also part of the Normandy invasion. Mr Crowson said the vendor, a collector of war memorabilia, had been in possession of the documents for about a decade. Both were \"very happy\" with the results of the auction, he added. \"The Operation Nestegg plan is a important piece of military and social history from a tumultuous time. \"The archive encapsulates the British government's determination and resolve to claim back [the Channel Islands],\" he added.

The team from the University of Southampton said it was the first time one from this period had been totally uncovered in the UK. Buckler's Hard, the small hamlet in the New Forest where the slipway is located, was once home to one of the busiest private shipyards of the 1700s. The researchers said they hoped the findings would help improve their understanding of shipbuilding techniques and infrastructure during the period. The slipway is the first of its era to be fully revealed in the UK The dig was supported by the newly formed Buckler's Hard Shipyard Trust, a conservation charity. A total of 55 wooden warships were built at Buckler's Hard for the Royal Navy in the 1700s, some of which were comparable in size to HMS Victory. \"No other private yard built as many ships for the navy during this period,\" said Prof Jon Adams, director of the university's Centre for Maritime Archaeology. Prof Jon Adams said Buckler's Hard provided a unique look into the shipbuilding techniques and infrastructure of the time Unlike the slipway at Buckler's Hard, most slipways from the 18th Century are now buried under concrete. Prof Adams said that made this one uniquely suited for learning about traditional shipbuilding. \"The only opportunity is a place like this where you can actually see the whole of the whole of the infrastructure and the logistical structures needed to build ships of that size,\" he said. The team also found some historical curiosities, such as musket balls and fastening nails from the 1700s",

The 41 slabs cross the Ewenny River in the Vale of Glamorgan and are adjacent to the 12th Century Ogmore Castle. They are listed as being \"of national importance\". In recent days, the names Patrick, Lily and Liana have appeared cut deeply into three stones. South Wales Police is investigating the damage as a heritage crime, with support from Cadw, the body which preserves and protects Welsh heritage. Cadw said criminal damage to listed buildings was on the increase, adding this year could see the highest ever number of reported crimes of damage and vandalism at some of Wales' ancient sites. The body said heritage crime was widely under-reported but rising, and encouraged anyone who witnesses suspicious behaviour at heritage sites to report it. It is a criminal offence to damage or destroy a scheduled monument or use metal detectors on protected sites without consent. Erica Staple, from nearby Merthyr Mawr, said it was \"mindless and unacceptable\". Ms Staple likened the damage to the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland. \"This is an absolutely beautiful place,\" she said. \"The whole village is upset by it. They've been there for hundreds of years and they've been defaced. \"To think anyone could do that. It's just awful.\" She added her daughter asked if it could be put right, and she told her \"there's nothing we can really do\". Marc Hollyman South Wales Police is investigating the damage as a heritage crime Ms Staple said she was concerned the three names could inspire copycats and there could be further vandalism. \"We've got to treasure what we've got,\" she said. She added despite the names written on the stone, the community had \"no idea\" who could have carried out the damage, which had \"clearly taken planning\". \"We don't know if they could be local or visiting the area. \"But we just don't know. There are different theories. We hope that the police and Cadw find out.\" What is heritage crime? Heritage crime refers to any illegal activity that harms historical assets. This includes: Theft of historic metal such as lead from church roofs Deliberate damage including graffiti or vandalism Unauthorised works on scheduled monuments Illegal metal detecting also known as \"nighthawking\" Anti-social behaviour, including littering, out of hours access or climbing on walls Marc Hollyman The 41 slabs cross the Ewenny River and are listed as being \"of national importance\"",

The Buckinghamshire Council site in High Wycombe has four separate buildings, including a neo-Georgian structure built in 1932. A Conservative councillor said she was \"exceptionally disappointed that this wonderful building is being sold\". The council said the site was \"currently underused\" and offered a \"prime location\". The 1932 building in Queen Victoria Road was designed by Richard Greaves Brocklehurst and Charles Cowles-Voysey in the neo-Georgian style. The Royal Institute of British Architects awarded a bronze medal for the design. On Tuesday, the Conservative-controlled council's cabinet will decide whether the sale of the site should go ahead with the most likely outcome being a residential development. A drawing of a possible design for the land shows about 180 flats across three buildings of up to seven storeys. The listed front facade of the 1932 building would be retained and converted but the rest of the site would be cleared. Councillor Lesley Clarke said the sale plan was \"disappointing in the extreme\" Lesley Clarke OBE, a conservative councillor, said: \"I am exceptionally disappointed that this wonderful building is being sold and that the Council Offices are moving. \"It is a beautiful building and has a lot of history . disappointing in the extreme.\" Independent councillor Trevor Snaith called for an immediate halt to the sale process and a full and open public consultation.

Google The site includes Albert House, a 1980s office block An independent colleague of Snaith, Khalil Ahmed, said: \"This is not just bricks and mortar; it's part of the town's identity. \"With imagination, the building could serve countless community purposes, but instead, the easy option is chosen: sell it off.\" A council spokesperson said the potential sale was part of \"ambitious regeneration plans for the town that the council is driving forward\". The spokesperson added the site was currently underused and offered a prime location and \"huge opportunity\" to attract further investment. The council said the cabinet had decided last year to relocate the council offices and sell the site, and information about the plan \"has been in the public domain throughout this process\".

        "content": "Volunteers reclaiming much loved historic railway 5 September 2025 Share Save Bea Swallow, BBC News, West of England and Luke Knight, BBC Radio Somerset Share Save The historic line ran between Bath in Somerset and Bournemouth in Dorset For more than a century the Somerset and Dorset Railway (S&D) served as a lifeline for rural communities - transporting coal, commuters and holidaymakers alike. The historic line ran between Bath in Somerset and Bournemouth in Dorset, serving towns and villages such as Highbridge, Glastonbury, Wells, and Wincanton. This week is the 60th anniversary since the 105-mile (168km) route was given a public notice it had to close all its station due to the Beeching cuts - a sweeping reduction of the UK rail network that severed thousands of miles of track. But now volunteers, historians and local residents are reclaiming sections of the abandoned route, determined to preserve the once rich history of the railway line. Julian Peters The historic line ran between Bath in Somerset and Bournemouth in Dorset In the 1960s, the British railway system was considered financially unsustainable, with underused lines, high maintenance costs, and slow passenger services. Dr Richard Beeching, former chair of the British Railways Board, aimed to modernise the railways by eliminating unprofitable routes and stations to create a more efficient, financially sound network. A total of 2,363 train stations were axed across Britain. As a child, Colin Price and his family referred to the S&D railway as the \"holiday line\", transporting them from Wells to Bournemouth for a seaside getaway. \"I was keen on railways anyway, so obviously I spent all my time with my head out the window, as you could in those days,\" he laughed. Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust On 5 March 1966 a coffin with the words \"S&D died today\" was loaded on to the very last train in a mock funeral to mark the service's demise Mr Price said the day the stone station was built, local residents \"thought it would be there forever, but it wasn't\". \"It was a very sad day,\" he recalled, as he watched the wooden sleepers being ripped from the ground. \"There was a lot of feeling around that it was the end of an era. \"The closest station would have been the main line at Castle Cary. It was getting further and further from anybody here, cutting us all off.\" John Strickland When the stone station closed, residents said they felt cut off from the world Elsewhere in Midford, tears welled in Peter Davis' eyes as he watched workmen tear down a legacy. \"My grandparents used to live just up the road, so I can remember it as a child,\" he said, conjuring a faint memory of roaring black locomotives. \"They took a couple of years to take the track up and I remember seeing them do it. It had a big effect on me. I cried at the time, I thought I'd lost something.\" Peter Davis said watching the train station fall into disrepair felt like a personal loss Eight years ago, Mr Davis began volunteering at the former station, cutting back overgrown vegetation and reinstalling old signs to \"see more clearly what it used to be like\". \"We lost a lot in the Beeching cuts, a lot of good railway lines,\" he said. \"But this is one I thought I could focus in on. It needed something doing with it.\" The site is now part of a popular walking and cycling path called the Two Tunnels Greenway, featuring the Devonshire Tunnel and the Combe Down Tunnel. Frank Tompson said life without the Two Tunnels network would be \"unimaginable\" Frank Tompson, chair of the Two Tunnels group, says the line was transformed into an active travel path in 2013, almost 50 years after the last trains rumbled through the stone arches. \"It was a case of uncovering both of the tunnels, keeping our fingers crossed they were in good condition, which luckily they were,\" he said. \"When you've got something like this on your doorstep, it's just a case of recycling what's already there. Bath now without the Two Tunnels would be unimaginable.\" In Shepton Mallet, the disused Windsor Hill tunnels are finding their purpose again as part of a 76-mile (122km) traffic-free circuit known as the Somerset Circle. When the passenger services stopped, the demolition trains arrived - destroying the Windsor Hill Tunnels so they could never be used again Gavin Mayall leads the Friends of Windsor Hill Tunnels group, a team of volunteers who \"dared to dream\" of reopening the route to the public. \"Probably about four years ago, the tunnel was inaccessible,\" he said. \"It was gated and there was scrap, fridges, tyres and all sorts just dumped here. \"A group of volunteers decided it was about time this amazing resource that had been lost for so many years was reopened to the public. \"The usage now is nothing short of remarkable. You build the paths and the people will come.\" However, the second tunnel still remains closed due to a rare bat colony nesting in its arches. The signal box, painted in the S&D colours, overlooks the former track at Masbury A disused signal box, originally built in 1874, was previously left to rot beside the former Masbury station before Joe Bourne snapped it up. He was in the process of putting his house on the market when he spotted the unique gem for sale. \"Most signal boxes were destroyed when they closed the line, or were vandalised or destroyed. I thought it had to be done,\" he said. \"It was a pile of rubble when I first moved here. I've never had a grand plan. I just saw the opportunity to buy it and I thought 'what a cool place, what a project'.\" Mr Bourne sensitively restored the building back to its former glory, painting it in the original S&D colours as a tribute to the lost relic. Rosie Craddock, lives in S&D railway viaduct with her family Rosie Craddock, lives in S&D railway viaduct with her family in Shoscombe. Her grandparents bought the land in the 80s following a long battle for planning permission. \"He [granddad] had the vision originally to make the arches into a house. \"Unfortunately he got too old to finish it, and my husband and I saw an opportunity. \"It's only when you get visitors like 'wow' you think, 'oh yeah actually, it is quite special',\" she added. Roger Burfitt described the S&D railway as a \"part of [the] community\" Roger Burfitt is acting chair of trustees at the S&D Railway Heritage Trust, who run public day trips along a mile-long (1.6 km) restored section of the railway in Midsomer Norton. The group of enthusiasts got together when the station was just days away from being demolished. \"They managed to save the day at literally the last minute,\" he explained. \"We are extremely fortunate because most of the other stations on the railway have either been demolished or become private residences.\" The station's signal box has been completely rebuilt to the original design, using components that have been rescued from other derelict signal boxes. \"It wasn't just an old railway, it served a purpose, it was part of a community. It fulfils a different role now,\" Mr Burfitt added fondly.",

        "content": "Criminal damage to historic buildings on the rise 6 September 2025 Share Save Matt Murray, BBC News and Tony Brown, BBC News Share Save BBC Neath Abbey has seen a spate of criminal damage incidents this year Criminal damage to listed buildings is on the increase, the body which preserves and protects Welsh heritage has said. Cadw said this year could see the highest ever number of reported crimes of damage and vandalism at some of Wales' ancient sites. It is a criminal offence to damage or destroy a scheduled monument or use metal detectors on protected sites without consent. Cadw said heritage crime was widely under-reported but rising, and has encouraged anyone who witnesses suspicious behaviour at heritage sites to report it. Criminal damage to listed buildings is on the increase, Cadw has said Neath Abbey has seen a spate of incidents this year, including new signage damaged, grass torn up and used as a bike track, windows to the under croft smashed, and a Tudor exhibition vandalised. Jon Berry from Cadw said there were \"40 to 50 incidents a year\" of heritage crime at their sites and \"in the low hundreds\" across historical environments in Wales. \"There's a cost to the public purse,\" said Mr Berry. \"At Neath Abbey it was mostly modern infrastructure that was damaged and the wonderful thing about these sites is they are authentic fragments we've inherited from the past, and once it's damaged or destroyed we've lost that so the community and all of our visitors lose out as that archaeological source is eroded.\" Since the beginning of the year, there have been police reports of criminal damage at several Cadw sites. In some cases, it has resulted in sites being partially closed to the public and planned conservation work being postponed to prioritise repairs. Anti-social behaviour at Caerleon's Amphitheatre and Barracks has seen graffiti, the heat from barbecues damaging Roman brickwork and even a burnt-out motorbike left at the site. Blaenavon Ironworks' Cast House was recently closed to the public after a visual display was vandalised and bricks thrown from the top of a tower. \"There are incidents of theft too at Blaenavon iron works,\" said Mr Berry. \"Lead from the roof was stolen, we replaced it, and it was stolen again. \"So, we now use a product which looks like lead but isn't and thankfully that has stayed on the roof.\" Windows to the under croft of Neath Abbey were smashed, and a Tudor exhibition vandalised Wales has one of the highest proportions of historic buildings in Europe - 30,100 buildings are listed. There are more than 4,000 scheduled monuments which include archaeological sites of national importance including Roman remains, burial mounds, castles, and bridges, with 400 registered historic parks and four world heritage sites. The consequences for deliberate damage to a scheduled monument range from fines to a prison sentence. Cadw Graffiti painted on the medieval masonry of the undercroft at St Davids Bishop's Palace What is heritage crime? Heritage crime refers to any illegal activity that harms historical assets. This includes: Theft of historic metal such as lead from church roofs Deliberate damage including graffiti or vandalism Unauthorised works on scheduled monuments Illegal metal detecting also known as \"nighthawking\" Anti-social behaviour, including littering, out of hours access or climbing on walls Rob Taylor says there needs to be education to prevent these crimes Rob Taylor, Wales' wildlife and rural crime co-ordinator, says the crimes are sometimes down to ignorance. \"People are coming to sites which they might not realise are ancient sites like burial grounds which can just be a grassy mound,\" he said. \"Areas like Gwent now have a special constable who is an archaeologist which is a fantastic addition to their team and we have police cadets involved patrolling these sites and education is really important to the public and the police. \"Everyone is aware of the problem but we need to look at how we can prevent it from happening in the first place.\" Bryn Celli Ddu passage tomb is one of the best known neolithic sites in Wales, but has seen graffiti and damage to the internal chamber Bryn Celli Ddu passage tomb on Anglesey, is one of the best known neolithic sites in Wales, dating back 5,000 years. It has recently seen graffiti and damage to the internal chamber stones. More than 40 marks were painted inside the passage and tomb, including fingerprints, handprints, diamond shapes and circles, and large symbols on the internal lintels. Ffion Reynolds, from Cadw, discovered the damage while planning an event. \"Every year we come to Bryn Celli Ddu to promote monuments for future generations of people to come and enjoy them, and while I was up here planning those events I went inside the chamber and discovered that it was covered in lots of paintings, more than maybe 40 or 50 marks in there, and it did feel like a bit of a bunker in there.\" Dr Reynolds said she believes education is key to preventing future vandalism. \"So one of the things we did as part of the project was we got permission from Cadw and worked with some of the young volunteers and we cleaned it off safely, but it was really good to involve these young volunteers because some of them were actually individuals that had been in trouble for graffiti, so in a sense this is the message, it's trying to get young people to understand the importance. \"A lot of them found the experience to be quite a privilege, so hopefully they went away and told their friends to make sure not to do this to other monuments across Wales.\" \"Leave nothing but a footprint and take nothing but a photograph\" says archaeologist Rhys Mwyn",

        "content": "Great Fire events to mark county's 'resilience' 5 September 2025 Share Save Alex Pope BBC News, Northamptonshire Share Save All Saints Church The Great Fire of Northampton occurred in 1675 A week-long series of free events is set to commemorate the 350th anniversary of a fire that devastated a town centre. In 1675, the Great Fire of Northampton destroyed 700 of 850 buildings and claimed 11 lives. Starting on Saturday, 13 September, events marking the anniversary are taking place including guided walks, music and theatre performances, and a main event in the Market Square the following Saturday. Art historian James Miller, who has spearheaded the project, said it was a chance to \"celebrate Northamptonshire's extraordinary resilience, civic pride and independent spirit\". The huge blaze was believed to have started from sparks from an open fire at a home on St Mary's Street and it quickly spread, with residents seeking refuge in the Market Square. Despite efforts to control it, prominent buildings including All Hallows Church were destroyed. Following a community-driven effort, the town raised  25,000 to fund reconstruction. A number of events have taken place in the past five months to commemorate what happened all those centuries ago, building up to this final week. Mr Miller said: \"The Great Fire of Northampton is a hugely significant moment in our local history and we have been thrilled to see so many people coming together in recent months to mark the 350th anniversary. \"This will be an opportunity for the county to come together to celebrate Northamptonshire's extraordinary resilience, civic pride and independent spirit. \"It is that character that shone through 350 years ago and is still very much in evidence today.\" Matt Crockett Music star and former Finedon vicar, Rev Richard Coles, is taking part in the week of commemorations The main event of the upcoming week will take place from 11:00-19:30 BST in the Market Square on 20 September, where a specially commissioned animation will premiere at 13:30 telling the story of the fire on a big screen. The film is the result of a project involving hundreds of local people answering the question: 'If Northampton burnt down again tomorrow, what would people save, what would people rebuild first and what would make it feel like our Northampton again?' Becky Carrier, of Northampton Film Festival, said: \"We're looking forward to showcasing everyone's work, as we come together as a community to commemorate this huge milestone in our town's proud history.\" There will also be an artisan market, live music, a performance from the Bach choir and displays from the police and fire service. Also on 20 September, a Service of Rededication will be held at All Saints' Church at 19:30 BST, where Rev Richard Coles - the former vicar of Finedon, Communards musician and Strictly Come Dancing contestant - will be a guest. A \"spectacular\" light show is due to be beamed on to All Saints' Church every night from 19:00, from 15 to 20 September. Fiori Musicali will perform an interpretation of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks at the church on the Thursday of that week. Father Oliver Coss, rector of All Saints, said: \"The memory of All Hallows' Church and its destruction in the Great Fire of Northampton serves as a reminder of the resilience of the town and its ability to recover and rebuild, even in the face of catastrophic events. \"The events will channel that community spirit and shine a light on the history and heritage that gives Northamptonshire such a proud identity.\" The Royal Household Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, came to Northampton in June to mark a year of commemorations Elsewhere, on Saturday 13 September, there will be Mystery Tours and guided walks from St Mary's Street through the town centre. The next day The Deco will host a performance called Northampton Remembers The Great Fire of 1675, from 16:30-18:30. From 15 September, Northampton Museum and Art Gallery will host an immersive mixed-media experience. Also from 15-17 September, the University of Northampton will hold an exhibition of artefacts loaned by Northamptonshire Archives Service. Then on 19, 20 and 21 September, Tipping Point - an art show by internationally renowned Luke Jerrams - will be in Hazel and Thoroughsale Woods in Corby, from 20:00-21:30. \"The show uses immersive light, smoke and sound to simulate the drama of a forest fire alongside a bespoke soundtrack created by Bafta and Ivor Novello award-winning composer Dan Jones, which includes the sounds of burning trees, whirring chainsaws, and fleeing animals, plus moving global testimonies from individuals who have experienced wildfires,\" organisers said.

        "content": "Captain Scott s famous polar shipwreck as never seen before 2 September 2025 Share Save Share Save Watch: Underwater footage shows the polar vessel colonised with sea life Rebecca Morelle, Alison Francis and Kevin Church BBC News Science One of the most famous polar shipwrecks has been filmed in detail on the sea floor for the first time. The Terra Nova carried Captain Scott and his men on their doomed expedition to reach the South Pole more than a century ago. The British party lost the race to the pole, and died on their return journey in 1912. The footage shows the Terra Nova colonised with sea life, but key features of the wooden ship are still visible including its wheel, winch and mast. Getty Images/Royal Geographical Society The Terra Nova is forever entwined in the tragic tale of Captain Scott and his men The wreck lies 170m down off the coast of Greenland. After the polar expedition with Scott, the ship continued in service and eventually sank in 1943 while carrying supplies to US bases during World War Two. The Terra Nova was discovered in 2012 by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, but the new expedition has been the first opportunity to record extensive footage of the wreck. \"To be able to see these significant parts of the wreck, it was truly awe inspiring,\" said Leighton Rolley, Science Systems Manager at REV Ocean. \"The wheel was sat there perfectly intact amongst the debris of the aft section of the wreck. \"When you think of the people who have stood there, manoeuvred the Terra Nova through ice, like Captain Scott  It was like, wow, if that ship's wheel could talk, it could tell an amazing history.\" The Terra Nova was one of the finest polar vessels of its time and sailed for 60 years. The ship was 57m (187ft) long with a wooden hull that was a metre thick in places to help it break through the sea ice. Captain Scott's men embarked to Antarctica in 1910. A comprehensive scientific programme was planned for the Terra Nova expedition - along with the goal of being the first to reach the South Pole. Scott, along with Edward Wilson, Henry Bowers, Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans, were attempting to make history. After trekking hundreds of miles, the British party reached the pole in January 1912, but they found they had been beaten by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen. Getty Images Captain Scott and his men reached the pole but realised others had got there first A black flag, planted by Amundsen, is now on display at the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in Cambridge along with other items from the Terra Nova. \"Their hearts must have sunk seeing this black flag against the whiteness of Antarctica,\" said David Waterhouse, curator of the polar museum at SPRI. The deflated British party began their arduous return journey to their base. But they encountered unusually bad weather, and Edgar Evans died after falling while descending a glacier. Several weeks later Captain Oates left the men's tent. His last words were recorded in Scott's journal: \"I'm just going outside and may be some time.\" He was never seen again. Scott, Bowers and Wilson continued on and made a final camp, but trapped by a freezing blizzard with dwindling supplies, all three perished. A search expedition discovered their last camp just 11 miles from a resupply depot that would have provided them with food and fuel. Getty Images The Terra Nova played a crucial role in breaking the news of their death. \"In January 1913, the Terra Nova arrived at Cape Evans in the Antarctic to pick up the shore party, and they were expecting to pick up Captain Scott and his pole party at the same time,\" explained Naomi Boneham, an archivist at SPRI. \"But when they arrived they found out the sad news.\" The ship's log records that the men had died from \"exposure and want\". The vessel sailed on to New Zealand, where the tragic end of the Terra Nova expedition was announced to the world.

Aethelstan ruled England from 927 AD to 939 and united the kings of Wessex, Mercia, Northumberland and East Anglia/Danelaw under a single crown. He was also king of the Anglo Saxons from his coronation in 925, and was buried in Malmesbury Abbey in Wiltshire. David Woodman, a professor of history at Cambridge University who has written a new book about the king, said: As we approach the anniversaries of Aethelstan's coronation in 925 and the birth of England itself in 927, I would like his name to become much better known. He really deserves that.\" Aethelstan was the grandson of Alfred the Great and in 929 he conquered the last Viking kingdom, York, at the Battle of Brunanburh, making him the first Anglo-Saxon ruler of the whole of England. He died in Gloucester in 939 and was succeeded by his half-brother Edmund. Woodman, from Robinson College, said: \"There has been so much focus on 1066, the moment when England was conquered. \"It's about time we thought about its formation, and the person who brought it together in the first place.\" Prof Woodman said he blamed a lack of public relations for this. \"Aethelstan didn't have a biographer writing up his story. \"His grandfather, Alfred the Great, had the Welsh cleric Asser to sing his praises. \"And within decades of Aethelstan's death, a wave of propaganda ensured King Edgar became famous for reforming the church. This completely overshadowed Aethelstan's earlier revamping of learning and religiosity.\" Edgar was the son of Aethelstan's brother Edmund, was the great-grandson of Alfred and became king of all England in 959. Getty Images King Aethelstan's bones were buried at Malmesbury Abbey in Wiltshire Prof Woodman said some historians dismissed Aethelstan's status as England's first king on the basis that the kingdom fragmented soon after his death in 939 and the focus instead shifted to Edgar. \"Just because things broke down after Aethelstan's death doesn't mean that he didn't create England in the first place,\" he said. \"He was so ahead of his time in his political thinking, and his actions in bringing together the English kingdom were so hard-won, that it would have been more surprising if the kingdom had stayed together. \"We need to recognise that his legacy, his ways of governing and legislating, continued to shape kingship for generations afterwards.\" He added Aethelstan brought England together just as parts of continental Europe were fragmenting. \"Nobles across Europe were rising up and taking territory for themselves. \"Aethelstan made sure that he was well placed to take advantage of the unfolding of European politics by marrying a number of his half-sisters into continental ruling houses.\" Parker Library/Corpus Christi The 10th Century manuscript shows the king and a saint Prof Woodman, together with other historians including Tom Holland and Michael Wood, has been campaigning for greater public recognition of Aethelstan's creation of England in 927 AD.

The work has been carried out on Dereham Windmill, in Norfolk, to weatherproof deteriorating brick work and remove moss from the exterior. It was made derelict in 1937 and opened to the public in 2013 as a community exhibition centre hosting events and art exhibitions across five floors. Philippa Whittington, trustee of Dereham Windmill, said: \"I only moved to Dereham a couple of years ago and it's a good way of getting to know people and getting to know things that are going on and it's nice to see something that is used for the community and it is staffed entirely by volunteers.\" Maddy Jennings/BBC Philippa Whittington said repairs to the building will be ongoing with urgent repairs being carried out first Built in 1836 by millwright James Hardy for Michael Hardy, a miller and baker, it ceased work as a mill in 1937 and was left derelict more than a decade later. The building received grade II listed status in 1972 and was opened to the public in 2013. Tracey Lingfield The mill opened to the community for events and exhibitions in 2013 Previously it underwent a number of renovations including work on the sails and was boarded up for some time to keep it weatherproof after failed funding attempts. She said: \"We had a number of work we had to do in getting rid of the moss on the outside and making sure the windmill was waterproof because we were suffering from a lot of water coming in through the bricks that were deteriorating so we are very pleased at the work that has been done.\" Ms Whittington said the work will be carried out in phases, with the urgent repairs done first. She said repairs will remain ongoing due to money strains. \"The idea is to keep it looking as it was shortly after 1836 when it was built, so it's really maintaining that building and making sure it doesn't deteriorate too much. \"The bricks tend of deteriorate in the weather, we have to make sure we replace them from time to time.\" Surveys carried out also show work will need to be undertaken on the cap of the windmill too.

On Sunday, the site near Langport in Somerset will be open to public so that people can view the villa and archaeological findings for the first time. The site includes remains of an old Roman villa, a ritualistic horse burial and luxury items that were used by the occupants. Agata Socha-Paszkiewicz, regional manager at Thames Valley Archaeological Services South West, said the finds were \"quite a significant\". The people living in the villa complex were likely to have been a wealthy family Ms Socha-Paszkiewicz said: \"In the villa, there probably would have been extended family as well as servants and slaves at Roman times. \"We have surviving floors and an atrium and evidence of a mosaic, which means they were quite wealthy, upper middle class.\" She said they found fragments of fine glass and hair pins that suggest they were trading with places quite far away from Somerset. \"We have some personal hygiene objects too, like tweezers. They are different objects that can tell us what life was like, how far they traded,\" Ms Socha-Paszkiewicz said. Agata Socha-Paszkiewicz said the findings were \"quite significant\" She added that the most common items they found was pottery and animal bones, as well as more than 60 coins. However, the most interesting find was a buried horse, she said. The remains show it was buried on its side, with its legs arranged to look like it was still galloping. \"It usually would have been a ritual or spiritual act. That's quite spectacular and quite a rare find,\" Ms Socha-Paszkiewicz said. People will be able to see the horse grave as part of the open day on Sunday. Correction 3 September: This article was amended on 1 September to make clear that archaeologists uncovered a villa, rather than a village as originally reported. The article has also been amended to remove part of a quote from Agata Socha-Paszkiewicz, from Thames Valley Archaeological Services, as saying of the discovery \"we are looking at probably several thousand occupants\" because this was a misquote.

Historic England Archive The boathouse was built in about 1894 for pioneering boatbuilder and engineer Samuel Saunders Sarah Gibson from Historic England said the listing \"celebrates the building's design and its origin as the early business premises of Samuel Saunders who became one of England's leading boatbuilders and engineers. Saunders commissioned the boathouse after the stretch of Thames nearby had grown more popular following the arrival of the railway in the 1840s. Jerome K Jerome's classic travelogue Three Men in a Boat, published in 1889, credited Goring and Streatley as \"charming places to stay\", the annual regatta was drawing large crowds and there was a boom in leisure boating. Historic England Archive Sarah Gibson at Historic England said the boatyard was a \"prominent local landmark\" Saunders offered boat building services and craft for hire from the boathouse which included the riverside wharf, a showroom and a manager's flat. The building, which faces both the riverside and High Street has had a variety of uses over time. Its showroom was leased to WHSmith and then to the Royal Mail for use as a sorting office and part of it currently houses a dental practice. Historic England Archive There was a boom in leisure boating in the area when Saunders commissioned the boathouse Samuel Edgar Saunders (1859 1933) At Goring he patented the Consuta boat building method, placing thin layers of wood together with a waterproofing material, stitched together with copper wire, creating a lightweight, tough hull that allowed for higher speeds In 1898 he built the steam launch Consuta as an umpiring boat for the Henley Royal Regatta, later used by the BBC for live TV commentary of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race In the early 20th Century he expanded his business to East Cowes on the Isle of Wight His company developed faster and lighter powerboats, flying boats, and aircraft Aircraft designer and manufacturer Sir Edwin Alliott Veron Roe invested in 1928, and the company became Saunders Roe, or Saro Its famous designs include Sir Malcolm Campbell's Bluebird K3 speedboat Source: Historic England",

The next time it will be possible to see the nearly 1,000-year-old work of art should be when it goes on display at the British Museum in September next year. However, the French art world is fiercely opposed to the project, with experts fearing the 70m-long (230ft) masterpiece is in far too delicate a state to be transported across the Channel. French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the loan when they met in London in July. The last few weeks have seen a big rise in visitor numbers at the Bayeux Museum ahead of its closure from 1 September. A new display area is being built for the tapestry, which will take at least two years. The closure   long planned   is what gave Macron the opportunity to perform his act of cultural diplomacy, committing France to loaning the tapestry to the British Museum for a year from next September. But that promise has triggered an outcry from many in the French art world. A petition   which describes the loan as a cultural crime   has drawn 60,000 signatures. What many opponents resent above all is the high-handed way they feel Macron decided to make his gesture to the UK, overriding the advice of specialists who say the vibrations inevitable in a long journey by road could cause irreparable damage.

Arthur, aged seven, found the tooth when he visited Lizard Point and showed it to Ken Wallace, who volunteers for the National Trust at the site. Mr Wallace, a retired dentist, recognised the tooth to be human which, after a police inquiry, was agreed to be an archaeological find. National Trust archaeologist Jim Parry is carrying out work at the site and said he had found fragments of jaw bones, teeth and a skull of at least one individual. National Trust Mr Parry said he had found fragments of teeth and bones in the mound Mr Parry said the mound had already eroded because of man-made and natural processes and would continue to do so due to its coastal location. The trust initially said it was thought at least one of the bodies was prehistoric, but further excavations showed more work was needed \"to understand how many people are represented and the periods of their burial\". He said: \"In this case, we will record as much as we can before it's lost and, hopefully in the near future, return to the site to excavate a wider area to fully understand the scale and nature of the monument in which the remains were buried, with its glorious vistas from the southernmost point of the British mainland.\" National Trust The National Trust says the remains will be sent to an osteoarchaeologist The National Trust said the remains were due to be sent to an osteoarchaeologist, a specialist in human remains, for detailed analysis.

Rot was found three years ago and became increasingly worse, leading to removal of the cap and the windmill's six sails in August 2024. The mill, which was built between 1878 and 1880, is one of just a handful still operating in northern Lincolnshire. It is hoped the six sails will be back on the mill in the next two to six weeks. The cap suffered rot and has taken a year to repair Suffolk Millwrights has spent a year repairing the cap, which houses the machinery and sails, and rotates to allow the sails to face into the wind. The mill, looked after by Waltham Windmill Preservation Society, was awarded a grant of  63,120 to carry out the work by Historic England after being put on its \"at risk\" register. Norman Major, who has been the miller at the windmill for ten years, told BBC Radio Humberside the repairs were \"a very big relief.\" \"Without the help from Historic England the work wouldn't have been done.

In the 19th century, the Chartists movement founded settlements in Snigs End and Lowbands, in Gloucestershire, as part of efforts to help working-class people satisfy the landholding requirement to vote. Over the years, Snig's End has fallen into disrepair and as a result has been nominated to be included in Historic England's Heritage at risk register for 2025. At a meeting on 11 August one resident reminded the council that Snigs End had been left to \"complete ruin\" leaving Lowlands as the best chartist site left which needs protecting. \"There are only five such settlements and this is the best one,\" they said. \"The Forest of Dean has already let the fourth one, Snig's End completely go to the wall   it's completely ruined. \"They've only got one chance left to keep one Chartist settlement going.\" Snigs End is considered at risk from development, alterations to the original Chartist cottages, and subdivision of the original plots, the Local Democracy Reporting Service was told. The council also said it is concerned about the condition of the closed Prince of Wales pub, which was built as a school for Snig's End, and the increase in traffic in the area. Carmelo Garcia Locals say Lowbands could be protected if the district council steps in And the real possibility of a new town with around 3,000 homes being built a stone's throw from Lowbands has sparked serious concerns among villagers that their heritage could also be \"completely ruined\". The meeting also heard that attempts to give Lowbands special protection as a conservation area had fallen on deaf ears at the District Council. Josh Wheeler from Redmarley Parish Council said: \"We've literally been knocking at their door and they've been keeping it firmly shut.\" The District Council has been approached for comment on the application for Snig's End to be considered by Historic England's heritage at risk register.

        "content": "Derelict fortress transformed into  3m party island 17 August 2025 Share Save Charlie Buckland BBC News Share Save Strutt & Parker The fortress did not even have running water when Mike Conner took it on Many dream of taking on a renovation project, something to transform and make your own. But for one former software company owner, the opportunity to bring back to life a derelict 19th Century Napoleonic fort brought with it more challenges than he had ever anticipated. Mike Conner, 52, snapped up Thorne Island near Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire for  555,000 in May 2017. The building, which was known for its parties under a previous owner, had been empty for 17 years, taking him about a year to bring it to a habitable state. Now equipped with 40 beds, four en-suite bathrooms and its own night club, the historic building has come a long way from having no running water, and is back on the market for  3m. \"Many have described it as a midlife crisis,\" Mr Conner joked. \"I really didn't know what I was getting myself into.\" Layered with history, the 100-man fort was originally built in the 1850s to protect the busy port of Milford Haven from French naval attacks. A proposal was first made in 1817 to fortify the island but it was not implemented until sometime after 1852. A date of 1854 has been carved above the island's entrance, according to the island's website. It was converted into a hotel in 1947 and hired out for birthday parties, weddings and stag parties, before being sold in 1999. By 2001 the building was bought by the Von Essen hotel group who intended to spend  4m to re-open the hotel, equipped with a cable car to allow access from the mainland. But it was largely abandoned when Mr Conner purchased the listed building, with the once-bustling party island left to grow over. Mike Conner Mike Conner bought the island back in 2017 and has devoted years to bringing it back to life \"There was no electric, no water, and any food or waste needed to come back off,\" he said. \"My wife was pretty cross when I first said I bought it, she said she would stay once it had a flushing loo, which is pretty reasonable.\" But Mr Conner did not anticipate the first flush would require cutting through 16ft (5m) of rock to get to the biodigester pump, ultimately costing him  200,000. Strutt & Parker Strutt & Parker The fortress now has 40 beds, four en-suite bathrooms and its own night club The 100-man fort was originally built in the 1850s to protect the busy port of Milford Haven from French naval attacks \"Wales has got some absolutely fabulous historic buildings that are in really sad states,\" said Mr Conner. The whole Thorne Island renovation process took nearly five years to get over the line, with six men living on the island for about four years while work was ongoing. Much of the equipment was brought in via helicopter, Mr Conner said, a process he described as \"incredibly hard\" given its location. He added getting materials was extremely difficult, but it was also a challenge for those who agreed to work on the project and live on site. \"Most people who joined the project, I still work with now,\" said Mr Conner. \"You just couldn't predict how many people want to help you.\" The men working on the island would spend stints of about two weeks on the island, unable to shower and covered in dust. \"They would charge their phones with a generator, and would have to have a dip in the sea for a wash. It was tough living,\" said Mr Conner. Mike Conner The island hosted its own festival for Mr Conner's 50th birthday, complete with a tight-rope performer Mr Conner, who trained as a design and technology teacher, said the design process excited him the most. He said he could not believe the Victorians could build something so magnificent, inspiring him to keep going. He added: \"A thousand men were working on it for two years, it was built in the same way as Stonehenge.\" \"I felt my task was really modernising it,\" Mr Conner said, adding the renovation was a task of figuring out how the new would work with the old. \"It almost feels like a tribute to their hard work and you're just really building the last little bit on top of what was already an awesome, bomb-proof construction.\" The island has \"seen everything\", according to Mr Conner, from 80-people parties to \"millpond serenity\". With \"no neighbours to upset\", the island hosted its own festival for Mr Conner's 50th birthday, complete with a tight-rope performer across the picturesque courtyard. \"People who come for a weekend are surprised when I hand them a bin liner and say it needs to come back off with them - but no-one comes here to collect the bins.\" Mike Conner The fortress, built in the 1850s, was intended to protect Pembrokeshire from French naval attacks As a former CEO, Mr Conner described his time on the island as \"incredible\" as he had to let go of everyday routines. \"We all often live by a calendar of scheduled meetings, but the island is the complete opposite - it's off grid. It feels real time, it feels like living.\" Time stops on the island, Mr Conner said, adding that with something always going on, people tended to put their phones away. \"I think that's what makes Thorne a special place, that people are present.\" Mike Conner Thorne Island operated as a hotel from 1947 to 1999, hosting weddings, hen and stag parties and birthdays Originally from Gloucestershire, Mr Conner does not live on the island but as the primary contractor spent a lot of time there during the renovation process. He initially juggled running his business alongside the venture, but sold his software company two years ago. \"It was quite cathartic for me to have this parallel life of complete chaos, which particularly through Covid was quite awesome.\" The project also lifted the lid on Mr Conner's personal heritage too, as it was not until he got the keys did he discover he is in fact a quarter Welsh, as his mum grew up at Upton Castle, Pembroke Dock. Mike Conner The island can host about 800 people, Mr Conner said Speaking of the island's future, Mr Conner said he hoped its new owner enjoys it as much as he has, but that it also has huge potential to operate as a tourist attraction, or play host to \"the most unbelievable raves\". Mr Conner said he envisaged the site offering an \"unbelievable 24-hour experience\", with the potential to host about 800 people. \"I think that would be great for Wales, but I'm not in that industry and I don't know how that works. \"If it was generating revenue, and creating jobs and sustaining itself, that would be a great outcome. \"The more people who could use it the better, as it's got to be one of the most interesting buildings in the area,\" he added. Mr Conner said more people needed to come to Wales and see what is there. \"It's a blank canvas, and the next owner can work out what it's for,\" he said, speaking of the island. \"But if there are any events there, I would crawl over broken glass to get there.\"",

The maritime miniatures were uncovered while staff at Leeds Industrial Museum were assessing and cleaning their collection of historic model ships. They are now on display as part of Engineery, an exhibition about the history of engineering and inventors. Leeds Museums and Galleries' curator of industrial history John McGoldrick said the art of model ship making was as \"old as shipbuilding itself\". He said: \"Each of the model ships in our collection has been made at a unique and very different moment in history, but what unites them is the ingenuity and attention to detail, which has gone into capturing each minute feature. \"That level of dedication and commitment speaks volumes about how impressive these ships were and how much they inspired and motivated each model maker to reach such incredible feats of creativity.\" Leeds Industrial Museum A model of the RMS Queen Elizabeth, once the biggest passenger ship ever built, is also on display The model bone ship carved more than 200 years ago is a replica of a 19th Century warship. It is believed to be an example of the type carved by French captives in British prisons and aboard ships during the Napoleonic Wars. Using leftover bone, the prisoners were also known to employ hair, clothing and jewellery in a model, which normally took a prisoner years to complete. Other ships in the museum collection include wool clipper Cromdale, built in Glasgow in 1891. After narrowly escaping disaster on her maiden voyage when she was hit by 300ft high icebergs, she later ran aground in thick fog, ploughing into cliffs off the coast of Cornwall, where the wreck is visible today. Several members of the crew died, including one who was reportedly eaten by a shark in Montevideo Bay. Also part of the collection is a scale replica of the RMS Queen Elizabeth. More than a 1.5m long, the model is a tribute to the much larger original cruise liner, which was once the biggest passenger ship ever built.",

        "content": "The battle to rescue an historic pub from ruin 17 August 2025 Share Save Alex McIntyre BBC News, West Midlands Share Save Historic England The Golden Lion pub was dismantled and moved to Cannon Hill Park in 1911 In the grounds of a 19th Century park lies an old, derelict, timber-framed pub which has had to withstand both the passage of time and adversity. Almost destroyed in the English Civil Wars, it was then dismantled and relocated before, in the 20th Century, almost being burnt down by suffragettes. The story of the Grade II listed Golden Lion in Birmingham is one of a \"rare and remarkable\" survival, conservationists say, and many believe the community has a duty to rescue it from ruin. Leaders of the restoration project received a boost in August after Historic England awarded them  344,265 to make vital repairs. The Golden Lion was one of 37 heritage sites in England - and four in the West Midlands - to receive funding, which also included the Bethesda Methodist Chapel in Stoke-on-Trent - known as the \"cathedral of the Potteries\". With the pub, which was originally based in Deritend High Street, its early history is \"shrouded in mystery\" though some of its timbers date back to the 15th Century, the Birmingham Conservation Trust says. The building was rebuilt between 1616 and 1644, thought to be as a result of damage during a Royalist attack on Birmingham in the Civil Wars era. Historic England The Golden Lion has deteriorated over the last 20 years Since then, the Golden Lion has been used as a pub, culler's house, six small homes, a scrap shop and a rangers' hut, the trust said. It was dismantled by the Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeological Society in 1911 before it was rebuilt at its current location in Cannon Hill Park, where it was used as a cricket pavilion. During the votes for women protests, it was badly damaged in an arson attack carried out by suffragettes in 1912. Sarah Hayes Sarah Hayes, pictured with a visitor at the site, said the building was in \"desperate\" need of repair Sarah Hayes, museum and trust director at the conservation trust, said: \"It's a rare and remarkable survival of a timber-framed building in Birmingham, one that has stood the test of time and survived beyond all odds.\" But the building has stood empty and unused for 20 years, falling into a dilapidated state, with scaffolding currently surrounding the site. The trust has been working with Birmingham City Council to try and bring it back into community use, though the grant from Historic England, a spokesperson said, would make the site secure and watertight but not yet usable. The repair work will include fixing the roof, chimneys, walls, floors, windows and doors, as well as adding French doors to the rear before the scaffolding is removed. Ms Hayes said it was \"our turn\" to help the much-loved building in \"desperate\" need of help. \"In many ways it feels like the last chance for us to act before its condition becomes beyond repair,\" she added. Historic England Bethesda Methodist Chapel was known as the \"cathedral of the Potteries\" Meanwhile in Stoke-on-Trent, charity Re-Form Heritage said it was \"delighted and grateful\" to receive  521,737 of funding for its work to rejuvenate Bethesda Methodist Chapel in Hanley. The Grade II* listed building on Albion Street, Hanley, was first built in 1798, according to the Friends of Bethesda Chapel. At first, it seated 600 people but was deemed to be too small in 1813, so the back wall was removed and the building extended to fit 1,000 people. As the \"fire of Methodism\" grew in the Potteries, the Friends of Bethesda Chapel said it was once again judged to be too small in 1819 so the extension was pulled down and replaced. The chapel reopened to worshippers in 1820 and was \"full to excess\" with about 3,000 people in attendance. Historic England said the chapel stood as a \"testament to the power and influence of the Methodist Church\" in 19th Century Stoke-on-Trent. Re-Form Heritage The chapel was extended on two occasions due to a growing number of worshippers Since its closure in 1985, the Friends of Bethesda Chapel and Historic Chapels Trust have been maintaining the site. Conservation specialists Re-Form Heritage have taken control of the efforts to bring the building back into use. The grant will go towards repairing plasterwork, timber panelling, staircases, east lobby and ceiling coving, a spokesperson said. The charity said the renovated site would \"provide a more attractive, comfortable and accessible space\". Under the plans, the building will be used as a mixed-use space in the future, housing creative arts education specialist Pinc College and feature exhibition and performance space. Re-Form Heritage chief executive Alasdair Brooks said: \"The funds will allow us to move forward with bringing the much-loved Cathedral of the Potteries back into community use. \"We're excited at being able to progress our work at this important Grade II* listed building over the coming months.\"",

        "content": "Exploring the catacombs which lie under a city 16 August 2025 Share Save Elliot Ball BBC News, West Midlands Share Save Birmingham City Council Archives A catacomb at Key Hill Cemetery opened in 1836 and was Birmingham's first The fact that a labyrinth of catacombs lies beneath one of the UK's biggest cities may surprise many. Rome or Paris could spring to mind for their underground chambers but Birmingham? But it is true - the UK's second city once housed more than 500 bodies in large, private vaults, dug out underground and used until the middle of the 20th Century. The first location to house them opened in 1836 at Key Hill Cemetery in the city's Jewellery Quarter before nearby Warstone Lane Cemetery opened 12 years later. Tour guide Richard Beardall said, at the time, the vaults cost up to  30 - about  3,000 in today's money. They were inspired by concepts across the continent before the British climate put an end to them in the late 1950s. \"The idea for the catacombs came from Rome where the bodies would dry out and mummify but, with the British climate, the bodies would instead go mouldy and smelly,\" Mr Beardall said. \"The coffins were metal-lined and supposed to be sealed but they weren't, because they tended to explode due to the gasses that built up in them. \"You can imagine a small room with 10 bodies decaying in them wasn't very pleasant. \"The idea was to go and see granny's coffin and go to polish the brass. \"It was a nice idea but, due to the practicalities, people just didn't like the idea of it.\" Heritage England A vault for a family cost about  30 each, according to Mr Beardall The 56-year-old is the principal tour guide for the two catacombs with a voluntary group, the Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries, formed in 2004. \"We primarily keep the place clean and tidy, raise funds to restore headstones, as well as reconnect families with their ancestors,\" Mr Beardall said. \"The responsibility [for the cemeteries] is with the council but we work very closely with them.\" The Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries The Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries maintain both cemeteries Describing what lies beneath the surface in Key Hill's catacomb, Mr Beardall said: \"Key Hill has a long linear arrangement but with a curve at each end so look like an elongated 'S'. \"They are also two-tiered but the lower level is below ground level and is no longer accessible or visible. \"There is a small interior section in a T-shaped tunnel. This is accessible and we hold tours on our open days.\" The Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries Each vault was for one family and could house about 10 bodies, according to Mr Beardall In contrast, he explained Warstone Lane's catacomb was below a now-demolished church in a semi-circular arrangement, on two levels. \"There would be a gate of wrought iron, possibly with glass backing and coffins would have been visible to all visitors to the cemetery,\" he said. \"Sadly these have now all been bricked up. \"A number [of vaults] were full while the cemetery was in operation so the gate would have been removed and a memorial fixed to seal the opening.\" Heritage England The catacombs at Warstone Lane were on two levels and tunnelled beneath a now-demolished church Both catacombs stopped being used in the late 1950s when they were no longer profitable and were bought by Birmingham City Council. Asked why it was important to preserve the Key Hill and Warstone Lane, Mr Beardall explained: \"Key Hill is a Grade II* listed cemetery because of its age and the people that are in there. \"We have the major founding fathers of Birmingham in the two cemeteries. \"It's important that we honour them and keep their final resting places intact.\" Key Hill in particular houses some famous names including Marie Bethell, claimed to be the country's first female reporter, along with Alfred Bird, the inventor of baking powder and egg-free custard and former politician Joseph Chamberlain.

It was made by men from the 4th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment, who were captured at the fall of Singapore in 1942. They spent more than three years as slave labourers for the Japanese army, much of it at Chungkai camp in Thailand. The centrepiece of the memorial in Leiston, Suffolk, is a union jack, used in the camp during funeral services and brought home by Corp Hermie Bailey after he and the other survivors were finally liberated. In 1952, the veterans transformed the \"moth-eaten rag\" into a tribute to the POWs of the 4th Battalion who died and to mark the 10th anniversary of their capture. \"Sometimes people just refer to it as a flag, but it's not just a flag - the flag is just the centrepiece of a very, very interesting and unusual war memorial,\" said Taff Gillingham, chairman of the Friends of the Suffolk Regiment. Norfolk Museums Service Men from Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire regiments joined other prisoners of war and slave labour to toil on the Burma to Thailand railway In 1942, the 4th Battalion was among many Allied divisions rushed to defend Singapore, in the wake of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour. After fierce fighting but against impossible odds, the British, Australian and Indian forces were ordered to surrender. Somehow the 11ft by 6ft (3.3m by 1.8m) flag went with the men of the 4th Battalion when they were transferred to Chungkai camp, said Mr Gillingham. This was a POW camp used during the construction of the infamous Burma-Thailand Railway, and today it is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery. About 13,000 Allied prisoners of war died during the railway project, plus an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 civilians, according to the commission. Mr Gillingham said the 4th and 5th battalions of the Suffolk Regiment were about 2,000 strong when they disembarked at Singapore in 1942, but more than a third of them had died by the end of the war. The POWs were allowed to build a little wooden chapel at Chungkai for church services, where the flag rested on its altar. \"And every time one of the soldiers died, it was used for the funeral service,\" Mr Gillingham said. \"Starved, beaten and executed for the slightest misdemeanours - the thing that inspires me is their resilience and their ingenuity, making medicines from plants that they'd find in the jungle, for example.\" The Long Shop Every year on VJ Day (Victory over Japan), the people of Leiston remember the men from the town who never came back, said historian Taff Gillingham Every aspect of the memorial has a specific link to the 4th Battalion, a territorial unit which recruited from the Leiston area. Mr Gillingham said: \"The frame is just as interesting [as the flag], in that it's made from wood salvaged from Southwold Pier and the metal frame it sits on was made by the engineering works of Garretts, the engineering works in Leiston, so it was a proper local project. \"And the colours behind the flag mean something too - they are the colours of the Pacific Star, the medal that all the Far East prisoners of war were given.\" Today, it is owned by the Friends of the Suffolk Regiment and is on long-term loan to the town's Long Shop Museum. When the men of the 4th Battalion were liberated at the end of the war, many, including Corp Bailey, continued to serve in the territorials for years, with weekly training and annual camps. Underneath the memorial is a plaque which describes it as \"a moth-eaten rag on a worm-eaten pole\". It also records how the union jack was \"hoisted to the top of the pole in the camp by the men of the battalion who survived three years of living hell\". Mr Gillingham said: \"It's often said to be the only war memorial based on an artefact brought back from the field, and it's certainly the only one I can think of, but it's a lovely thing because it has a direct connection with the place, and the people, with those who died.\" A service to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day and the end of World War Two will be held at the memorial at 10:30 BST.",

Wing Commander Cuthbert \"Cubby\" Lander from Northumberland led the 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment at the Battle of Meiktila in March 1945 and was killed aged 30 during a night-time patrol. His pivotal role in the battle was remembered with an annual dinner at the regiment's headquarters, RAF Honington, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Wing Cdr Lander's niece Penny Fell, 81, said: \"It's absolutely times like this VJ Day milestone that we should be remembering the sacrifices that war calls for. \"And - both for the regiment and our uncle - where the sacrifice has been great and the contribution significant, there isn't a shelf life on honour or gratitude.\" VJ Day stands for Victory over Japan Day and commemorates 15 August 1945 when Japan surrendered, bringing the Second World War to a complete end. Fell family handout Penny Fell (left) and her late sister Juliet Francis were invited to the RAF Regiment's annual dinner in honour of their uncle in 2020 The Battle of Meiktila was both a significant milestone in the reconquest of Burma by Allied forces from Japan and one of \"the greatest and proudest battle honours\" for the newly-formed regiment, said the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund. \"The unusual thing about Lander is he was a wing commander, but he was leading a clearance patrol of the airfield when he died, partly because they'd lost so many officers and also because he was a man of action who the troops looked up to terrifically,\" said Warrant Officer Mac MacDonald, 60, manager of the RAF Regiment Heritage Centre. \"Not many other wing commanders would have done so or been able to - and in other circumstances, he would have been awarded some kind of medallic recognition,\" WO MacDonald added. Fell family handout The wing commander - known as Bill in the RAF - married during the war and his widow Eileen remained close to the family The capture of the important command and supply centre at Meiktila was crucial to the plan of General Bill Slim - who led the 14th Army in the Burma campaign - to prevent the Japanese army from organising effective action. The 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment had been set up in 1942 to provide a ground defence force for the air force and its men had the specialist skills needed to defend Meiktila's airstrips. Mrs Fell said: \"Slim - commander of the 14th Army - saw that morale and supplies were the two things they needed to beat the legendarily fierce Japanese fighters and the airfields were crucial to his strategy of getting men and supplies to the places they needed to be.\" The Japanese army rushed in reinforcements to besiege the town, desperate to recapture Meiktila. Two runways could not be held at night, so Japanese patrols would move in under darkness and establish themselves on the airstrips. The 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment gunners had to clear the airstrips every day, before essential supply, casualty evacuation and fighter aircraft could land. Fell family handout After his father died, the Lander family moved to Kirkley, just north of Newcastle, where Cuthbert started school (front row far right) Wing Cdr Lander was responsible for coordinating the actions of the 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment squadrons and flights [platoons] and often led night patrols. In his diary, he wrote: \"Mortars and snipers gave us hell and it took an hour to get our casualties clear. \"Bullets were flying in all directions which didn't make our task pleasant... not a man relaxed his efforts.\" Lander and his runner, Leading Aircraftman Dakers, were shot dead on 24 March. WO MacDonald said: \"The capture of Meiktila was an essential part of Gen Slim's plan to beat the Japanese and (if they had not retained it) the rest of the campaign would have been very difficult and very different. \"People talk about the battles of Kohima and Imphal as the turning points in the Burma campaign, but the thing that cemented those achievements was the battle for Meiktila.\" Air Historical Branch RAF Crown Copyright A newspaper in March 1945 reported the 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment were using a captured Japanese foxhole as a shower, featuring Wing Cdr Lander (right) Wing Cdr Lander was the youngest of seven and born in Northumberland, where his father was a coachman on an estate at Simonburn near Hexham. His childhood was one of \"considerable poverty\" after his father died when he was four, said Mrs Fell, who lives near Cardiff. She is too young to remember \"Uncle Cubby\", but was brought up on stories of his charisma and sense of fun and the loss has been remembered down the generations. The family remained close to his widow Eileen who never remarried, and Mrs Fell chose Cuthbert as the middle name for one of her sons. \"By 1942, he joined the RAF Regiment as a pilot officer and it's quite something to go from joining a regiment and becoming a wing commander that fast, even with dead man's shoes,\" she said. Air Historical Branch RAF Crown Copyright In a letter of condolence to his widow, Air Vice Marshal Vincent praised Wing Cdr Lander's \"wonderful leadership\" In 1990, Leading Aircraftman Dennis Leftley remembered \"there was a feeling of great loss that day [when Wing Cdr Lander died] - he was a great bloke to the lads\". Mrs Fell said: \"Afterwards, another of Cubby's men described him as 'the bright star that shone in the darkness of Meiktila'. \"He paid the ultimate sacrifice for a very important cause and there's just me and one nephew left alive now, so this is our last shout to say how wonderful it would be if he could be remembered for what he has contributed.\"",

        "content": "VJ Day: The padre, the medic and the secret radio 15 August 2025 Share Save Katy Prickett BBC News, Cambridgeshire Share Save Ely Museum Returning prisoners of war, led by John Beckett, marching past Ely's war memorial in November 1945 The end of World War Two 80 years ago meant liberation for three men who were \"beacons of humanity and resistance to evil\". Noel Duckworth, George Easingwood and John Beckett were captured with the 2nd Battalion The Cambridgeshire Regiment at the fall of Singapore in February 1942. They were a chaplain whose courage prevented a massacre; a sergeant who tirelessly cared for the starving and injured; and a captain who created a hidden radio to provide morale-boosting news updates. \"They found themselves in this unimaginably awful situation and did not give up or give in to selfishness - it's an incredible story,\" said Felix Jackson, from Ely Museum. The 2nd Battalion was a territorial division, \"a unit imbedded in the local Ely population, quite often it was sons following fathers,\" said Mr Jackson. In 1941, they were heading to India for garrison duty, when the attack on Pearl Harbour took place and the ship they were on was rushed to Singapore. After fierce fighting but against impossible odds, the British, Australian and Indian forces were ordered to surrender. The Cambridgeshire Regiment was about 1,900-strong when it reached Singapore, but by 1945, 784 officers and men had died fighting or as prisoners. The conditions the Japanese Army inflicted upon the prisoners of war (POWs) have since become a by-word for brutality and cruelty, while millions of civilians also died in the South East Asian countries the army occupied. The padre who 'used his charisma' Cambridgeshire Regiment Research Trust Chaplain Noel Duckworth pictured in late 1945. He rowed for Great Britain in the 1936 Olympic Games Chaplain Noel Duckworth (1912-1980) loved rowing - and the sport would go on to save his life. At 5ft 2in (1.6m), the vicar's son from Yorkshire coxed for his college at the University of Cambridge, for the university boat club - and for Great Britain during the 1936 Berlin Olympics, said Mr Jackson. By the outbreak of World War Two he was a Church of England priest and he joined the 2nd Battalion as its padre - the name given to Army chaplains. As Singapore fell, field hospitals were being overrun and the injured were being executed, so the order went out that it was every man for himself. \"Amazingly, Royal Army Medical Corps personnel elect to stay behind and look after the wounded and Noel Duckworth sees it as his duty to do the same,\" said Mr Jackson, co-founder of the Cambridgeshire Regiment Research Trust. The group he was with was captured and the order to kill was about to be given. The padre's story featured on the TV programme This is Your Life in 1959 Mr Jackson said: \"Noel steps forward and starts berating the Japanese officer and everyone around him, giving them a proper parade-ground telling off. \"There's a moment of hesitation and the officer recognises Noel from his rowing days - the Japanese had a rowing team at the Olympics - and, according to multiple reports, this stops the massacre, all because he stood up and did what he could.\" This episode set the pattern for the way he behaved during his years of captivity, paying the price with \"incredibly severe beatings\" for standing up for his fellow POWs, said Mr Jackson. \"He would use his charisma to trade with the guards for food or medical supplies - everyone speaks so highly of him as this remarkable chap, getting up to a little bit of mischief,\" he added. After the war he worked in Ghana, before returning to Cambridge to become chaplain of the newly founded Churchill College. The selfless medic Ely Museum Ely's Sgt George Easingwood (1919-1987) was awarded the British Empire Medal for his bravery and devotion as a medic, which saved many of the prisoners \"George Easingwood's story is another one of moral courage, he is caring from the off,\" said Mr Jackson. At the time of capture, the grocer's assistant from Ely was an acting medical sergeant, triaging patients alongside a doctor. He was initially held at Changi Prison before being sent to join the POWs toiling relentlessly as slave labour while building the Burma to Thailand railway. They were also expected to work on docks, airfields, in coalmines, shipbuilding yards, steel and copper works. So in 1944, Sgt Easingwood was among thousands of Allied POWs crammed into unmarked and disease-riddled \"hell ships\", sent to become slave labour in Japan. Ely Museum He was selfless in his care of the men he was with, who were suffering from tropical diseases and malaria, malnutrition and torture, said Mr Jackson Mr Jackson said: \"He is sent to Tokyo knowing that when the Allied invasion comes, they're all going to be killed - except the atomic bombs are dropped and the war is over.\" On his return home, he was nominated for a British Empire Medal by fellow-survivors. \"The citation talks about the incredible care he showed during a terrible cholera outbreak in 1943 and how he looked after 750 men during the voyage to Japan, despite suffering from [tropical disease] beri-beri and marked malnutrition, while refusing to rest when his medical officer said he was too ill to work,\" said Mr Jackson. Sgt Easingwood remained in Ely for much of the rest of his life, marrying and staying active in a Far Eastern Prisoner of War (FEPOW) club until his death. Saved by a Rolex Ely Museum John Beckett was a young captain when he was captured, but on liberation went on to become a colonel and is seen here with Queen Elizabeth II in 1955 \"Within four months of capture, John Beckett comes up with a plan to scavenge whatever machinery and electronics they can to create a rudimentary radio,\" said Mr Jackson. \"He knew there was huge personal risk, if the radio was found he risked beatings, torture and probable execution - but morale is suffering and he felt the best way to help that is to get hold of news about the war.\" Capt Beckett (1914 to 1987) was a solicitor in Ely before the war, who had followed his uncle Lt Col Archer and taken a commission in the Cambridgeshire Regiment. \"He described the absolute shock of being told to surrender and within a few weeks he was getting a bit itchy and keen to push back so comes up with the idea of making a radio - it's this quiet resistance that's quite remarkable,\" said Mr Jackson. Ely Museum Capt Beckett would seek out men from the Royal Corps of Signals to help create a much smaller radio (above) which remained in use until mid-1944 The initial radio was hidden in the latrine's roof, but it was too big to be portable so over time, a radio was developed small enough to fit into his 8in by 6in (20cm by 15cm) water bottle. Captain Beckett was the one listening to the updates and writing them down. Mr Jackson said: \"There was one occasion, where a Japanese sentry stumbles across him doing this, works out what is going on, but see his fancy Rolex watch and takes that in exchange for not reporting him.\" He also kept a secret list in his bible of the names of the men who went missing or died - or got moved into different work groups - as a record for when the war ended. On his return to Ely, he married, remained in the territorials, and ended up becoming its commanding officer. Ely Museum A group of Allied prisoners of war celebrating after liberation Mr Jackson said: \"They were such remarkable men and it's important we remember them because they were people from the communities we live in now. \"A vicar, a grocer's assistant and a solicitor - people who risked everything to help those around them and are beacons of humanity and resistance to evil.\" Follow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

The Peebles Hoard, which had lain undisturbed for 3,000 years before it was discovered in 2020, was acquired by National Museums Scotland (NMS) last year. It comprises more than 500 unusual bronze and organic objects and components, many \"without archaeological parallel anywhere in the world\". NMS senior curator of prehistory Dr Matthew Knight said: \"The Peebles Hoard is truly a one-of-a-kind discovery, and I have never seen anything like the stunning, silver-coloured finish of these Bronze Age objects. They almost glow.\" NMS The true colour of many items was unclear prior to the conservation work The hoard has been described as one of the most significant ever found in the country. Dating from between 1,000 and 800BC, it was allocated to NMS under the Treasure Trove system, with a payment made to the detectorist Mariusz Stepien who found it. NMS said the defining technological characteristic of the Bronze Age was the widespread use and production of bronze - an alloy of copper and tin that is usually a deep golden colour. However, conservation of the Peebles Hoard has revealed rare silver-coloured objects from an era when silver was unknown. Crown Copyright Hundreds of pieces were discovered by a metal detectorist in 2020 Analysis has revealed the colour is the result of high levels of tin on the surface. This is thought to be the product of a deliberate enrichment technique by highly-skilled craftspeople. The bronze objects emerged from the earth encrusted with earth and green copper patina - a film produced by oxidation After months of careful preparatory work to stabilise, assess and document the material in the hoard, conservators are painstakingly removing thousands of years of dirt and corrosion to reveal the \"spectacular lustre\" of the original surface. Duncan McGlynn It has been estimated conservation work will take three years to complete It is estimated that it will take three years to complete the conservation work on the discovery. Bethan Bryan, conservator at NMS, said: \"Working on the conservation of the Peebles Hoard is a rare privilege and definitely a career highpoint. \"As well as removing dirt and corrosion, it is essential that we preserve as much precious organic material as possible for future research. \"Getting to this point has been a challenging and incredibly time-intensive process, but the moment the silvery surface began to emerge was magical, a secret revealed after 3,000 years.\" NMS The items are estimated to have lain undisturbed for 3,000 years",

        "content": "The Egyptologist and former minister of antiquities will be the first Arab to lead the UN s cultural organisation. The board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has nominated Egypt s Khaled el-Enany, an academic and former minister of tourism and antiquities, as its next head, before the organisation s general conference next month. If confirmed, el-Enany, a professor of Egyptology at Cairo s Helwan University, would become the first Arab director-general of the organisation, which oversees the UN s handling of cultural heritage, alongside international cooperation in other areas, including science and education. The former minister campaigned widely for the role, which was also contested by Firmin Edouard Matoko of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabriela Ramos of Mexico, who withdrew from the race earlier this year. The decision by the board, which represents 58 of the agency s 194 member states, is expected to be finalised at a meeting of UNESCO s general assembly in Uzbekistan next month. The organisation s next leader will replace France s former Minister of Culture Audrey Azoulay, who has served in the role since 2017. Azoulay notably helped lead a high-profile effort to rebuild the ancient Iraqi city of Mosul after it was devastated during fighting between the ISIL (ISIS) armed group and combined US and Iraqi forces. El-Enany s nomination comes as the Paris-based UN body continues to face political challenges, including in its work of choosing which cultural heritage sites to help preserve from threats including wars, pollution and climate change.  The organisation is also set to face an 8 percent funding cut at the end of 2026, when the United States again formally withdraws its membership, along with its funding. It will be the second time that the Trump administration has pulled the US out of the UN cultural organisation in protest at its members  decision to admit the State of Palestine as a member in 2011. The State of Palestine is also a Permanent Observer State member of the UN General Assembly, where more than 80 percent of member states now back its full membership. Explaining the US decision to withdraw again, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce claimed that allowing Palestine to remain a member of UNESCO had  contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organisation . Israel left UNESCO at the end of 2018. The organisation has been remotely monitoring damage to cultural heritage sites in the Gaza Strip during Israel s war, and says it has verified damage to a total of 110 sites since October 7, 2023, including 13 religious sites, 77 buildings of historical or artistic interest, three depositories of moveable cultural property, nine monuments, one museum and seven archaeological sites. El-Enani, 54, worked earlier in his career as a tour guide at ancient Egyptian sites, earned a doctorate in France and became a famed Egyptologist before serving in government. He was minister of antiquities and, later, tourism, under Egypt s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi from 2016 to 2022. El-Sisi welcomed the news of el-Enani s nomination, calling it a  historic achievement that shall be added to Egypt s diplomatic and cultural record and to the achievements of the Arab and African peoples . During his tenure in government, el-Enani oversaw the start of mega-tourism projects, including the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo, the Jewish Temple and multiple ancient discoveries that helped revive the country s battered tourism sector. He is expected to focus on UNESCO s cultural programmes, and has pledged to continue UNESCO s work to fight anti-Semitism and religious intolerance, according to The Associated Press news agency.",

        "content": "The newly discovered tombs are believed to date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period. Archaeologists in drought-hit Iraq have discovered 40 ancient tombs after water levels in the country s largest reservoir declined, according to an antiquities official. The tombs, believed to be more than 2,300 years old, were unearthed at the edges of the Mosul Dam reservoir in the Khanke region of Duhok province in the country s north.  So far, we have discovered approximately 40 tombs,  Bekas Brefkany, the director of antiquities in Duhok and leader of the archaeological work at the site, said on Saturday. His team surveyed the area in 2023 but spotted only parts of a few tombs. They were able to work on the site only when water levels dropped  to their lowest  this year, Brefkany said.  Drought allows us to do excavation work  In recent years, archaeologists have uncovered ruins dating back thousands of years in the same area, as a result of droughts that have plagued Iraq for five consecutive years.  The droughts have a significant impact on many aspects, like agriculture and electricity. But, for us archaeologists   it allows us to do excavation work,  Brefkany said. The newly discovered tombs are believed to date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period, according to Brefkany. He added that his team is working to excavate the tombs to transfer them to the Duhok Museum for further study and preservation, before the area is submerged again.  Iraq, which is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, has been facing rising temperatures, chronic water shortages and year-on-year droughts. Authorities have warned that this year has been one of the driest since 1933 and that water reserves were down to only 8 percent of their full capacity. They also blame upstream dams built in neighbouring Iran and Turkiye for dramatically lowering the flow of the once-mighty rivers Tigris and Euphrates, which have irrigated Iraq for millennia.",

One hundred years after it was made The Birth of a Nation still has the power to both enthrall and appall. The film is as confounding as ever, both brilliant and repugnant. Groundbreaking in its use of innovative cinematic techniques, it remains tainted by its brazen racism. The Birth of a Nation was the creation of DW Griffith, who had tried his hand as an actor and playwright but whose real genius lay in film-making. Nothing on its scale had even been attempted before. It was the epic story of the relationship between two American families, one Union, the other Confederate, at the time of the Civil War and the Reconstruction that followed. The film ran for more than three hours and employed (according to a New York Times report from the time) 18,000 people and 3,000 horses. By 1922 it had been watched by more than five million people. It was the first blockbuster.  It was a box office success   a mainstream film, so utterly mainstream,  says Professor Alan Rice, a Birth of a Nation expert at The Institute for Black Atlantic Research at the University of Central Lancashire, who has been organising a series of symposia on the film.

        "content": "It s amazing how little art has changed since the decade of grunge rock and Ally McBeal. We re stuck in a rut and can t move on writes Jason Farago. How long does it take for the present to become history? Once our museums and universities were guardians of the past, but now they seem ever more concerned with the here and now. But what was once new must inevitably turn old, and historically minded curators are beginning to turn their gaze to the 1990s: a decade that feels like only yesterday and yet like ancient history all at the same time. They ve been coming thick and fast, these  what were the  90s?  surveys. In 2013, the New Museum in New York presented NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star, which filled the museum s entire building with art from the year of Bill Clinton s inauguration. Last year, the Centre Pompidou s satellite space in Metz unveiled 1984 1999: The Decade, which showcased the generation that put French art back on the global art world s map. And opening this week at New Jersey s Montclair Art Museum is Come As You Are: Art of the 1990s, a hotly anticipated full-scale survey of the last decade of the last millennium. The passing of the 1990s into history may feel a little sudden but this wave of 1990s shows marks a welcome effort to impose historical rigour on a period we still sometimes call  contemporary . By insisting on the distance between then and now, and by placing the works in the context of their times   Clinton and Blair, Bosnia and Rwanda, grunge rock and Ally McBeal   these shows do the great service of showing how this art came to be. Yet these exhibitions do something else too: they reveal that the gap between then and now might not be as gaping as presupposed, and that, in aesthetic terms at least, the  90s are still going strong 15 years past their expiration date. Dream of the  90s If you want to understand the art of the 1990s, you have to start not with aesthetics but with economics. The 1980s, especially in New York but also in cities from Cologne to Tokyo, was a period of media excess and frenzied stock market speculation, typified by aggressive large-scale painting that sold for lots of money. But in 1991 the art market crashed spectacularly, closing galleries right and left. Prices fell by more than 50% for many contemporary artists, and average art prices didn t recover their pre-crash height until 2003. (Now they are even higher, of course.) Art in the 1990s, in economic terms but also in aesthetic ones, went through a period of retrenchment and rethinking.  Value in everything is being questioned,  said Mary Boone, the influential 80s art dealer, in the midst of the crash.  The psychology in the 80's was excess; in the 90's, it's about conservation.  What typified the art of those days? Race, sexuality and multiculturalism were hotly debated at the start of the decade, notably at the controversial Whitney Biennial of 1993, of which the most famous artwork was an admissions button, designed by Daniel J Martinez, reading  I Can t Imagine Ever Wanting to Be White.  The rise of the World Wide Web had a strong influence on art production. So did celebrity culture, especially in Britain, where the Young British Artists hit the galleries and the tabloid front pages. The big theme was globalisation. That was reflected not only in the art of the time, but in the institutions that arose from it: the 1990s was the decade when biennials, from Johannesburg to Montreal to the South Korean city of Gwangju, became central nodes in artistic production and transmission.",

Despite glitches, it offers a glimpse of a future in which there are no linguistic misunderstandings   especially ones that change the course of history. BBC Culture looks back at the greatest mistranslations of the past, with a 19th-Century astronomer finding signs of intelligent life on Mars and a US president expressing sexual desire for an entire nation. Life on Mars When Italian astronomer Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli began mapping Mars in 1877, he inadvertently sparked an entire science-fiction oeuvre. The director of Milan s Brera Observatory dubbed dark and light areas on the planet s surface  seas  and  continents    labelling what he thought were channels with the Italian word  canali . Unfortunately, his peers translated that as  canals , launching a theory that they had been created by intelligent lifeforms on Mars. Convinced that the canals were real, US astronomer Percival Lowell mapped hundreds of them between 1894 and 1895. Over the following two decades he published three books on Mars with illustrations showing what he thought were artificial structures built to carry water by a brilliant race of engineers. One writer influenced by Lowell s theories published his own book about intelligent Martians. In The War of the Worlds, which first appeared in serialised form in 1897, H G Wells described an invasion of Earth by deadly Martians and spawned a sci-fi subgenre. A Princess of Mars, a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs published in 1911, also features a dying Martian civilisation, using Schiaparelli s names for features on the planet.",

        "content": "One of the surprising joys of downtown Los Angeles   a city most visitors think of as one great freeway where no-one even thinks of walking   is Grand Central Market on South Broadway. Opened in 1917 on the ground floor of the Homer Loughlin Building and designed by the English-born architect John B Parkinson, the market has served succeeding generations of immigrants. Today, 80% of those who shop here daily are Hispanic Americans, a fact reflected in the wealth of fresh fruit, vegetables and Spanish delis. Most of these, though, display their wares under all-American neon signs hung from the reinforced concrete beams of an innovative building where Frank Lloyd Wright, the most famous of all US architects, once ran his studio. The architecture of Seattle s Pike Place Market is a rambling affair in a number of different styles dating from 1907, when this waterfront enterprise first opened. Located on several hillside levels, the nine-acre (3,600 sq m) market offers everything from the freshest Pacific fish to local crafts. A publicly owned development, it houses some 500 people as well as feeding and delighting many more. Of course you can dine on sushi here, although in its early days and before Congress passed an act in 1942 sending them to internment camps for the duration of the Second World War, Japanese-American families had made their special mark here, owning at least 80% of the market stalls. Pike Place Market thrives today, a city centre alternative to a world of manufactured food and heavily marketed retailing. If you re lucky, you will even see   hard to miss him   Sol  The Cod Father  Amon, Pike Place s longest serving stall holder and a Seattle legend, outside Pure Food & Fish. Market buildings and big characters have long gone hand in hand. Les Halles   the  Belly of Paris . This mid-19th Century Crystal Palace of food, designed by the City Architect Victor Baltard, was demolished in 1971 (Wikimedia Commons) For sheer architectural beauty, Europe and the Middle East offer the finest of all covered markets. Despite intense competition from opulent palazzos and mesmerising art-laced churches, few visitors to Venice can fail to be impressed by the Pescheria, the covered fish market set cheek-by-gill with Rialto Bridge. A fish market has existed near here since 1097, although the existing Neo-Gothic building designed by architect Domenico Rupolo and painter Cesare Laurenti dates from 1907. Look up at the capitals crowning the columns supporting the roof: they sport fish heads rather than classically correct volutes or acanthus leaves. Competing for artistry, however, are the displays of fresh food on offer, here and in the next-door Erberia or fruit and vegetable market. The market is best approached by the traghetto   gondola ferry   from Santa Sofia on the other side of the Grand Canal. This way, the worlds of fish, water, boats, a very grand canal, a particular cuisine and unforgettable piscine architecture are caught in one distinctive Venetian net. Daily bread These Italian and US markets are particular as well as special. Paris, on the other hand, has a long tradition of everyday covered markets throughout the city. These are the children of the great central mother market, Les Halles   the  Belly of Paris , its name adopted from the title of Emile Zola s 1873 novel, Le Ventre de Paris, although this mid-19th Century Crystal Palace of food, designed by the City Architect Victor Baltard, was demolished in 1971.",

        "title": "The Americans: Were the KGB the good guys?",
        "content": "The US TV series examines the Cold War from the perspective of Russian agents   and offers up a radical revision of history, writes Eric Kohn. While the US may struggle with its own history of espionage, its CIA and FBI have nothing on the KGB. The Soviet security agency has been one of the great faceless  villains  in the American imagination since World War Two. Since so many of the Cold War s  battles  took place behind closed doors, some of the conflict s key moments   and even players   may be unknown to history. Hollywood usually responded to this lack of information about  what was really happening  by portraying the Cold War as a battle against Russians who are villainous caricatures   with the KGB as a one-note, shadowy threat. The US TV series The Americans, which begins its third season on 28 January, challenges that notion by giving Soviet agents a familiar face   one we are supposed to empathise with. This is a radical shift in perspective, the full implications of which haven t been examined as closely as they should. In the series, Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) are Soviet agents posing as a quiet suburban family in the early 1980s. As The Americans explores the agents' ongoing missions to disrupt US interests and juggle other daunting orders from their handlers, it adopts the twisting structure of a classic espionage tale. The disguises they wear when assuming different identities, marked by innumerable ridiculous wigs, wouldn't feel out of place in an episode of The A-Team or Alias. But the show has a distinctive edge thanks to creator Joe Weisberg, a former CIA agent, whose storylines continually emphasise the similarities between the spies and their American foes. The result is a subtle parody of American suburban life: Philip and Elizabeth grapple with how best to raise their children, navigate infidelities and jealousies, deal with  bedroom problems  and intrusive neighbours. It s the stuff of soap operas, except that this nuclear family has a hand in events that might actually go nuclear. The bad guys don't just look like  us ; they struggle like us, too. Seeing red A few years ago, Sleeper Cell, another programme on US TV, attempted a similar concept but set in the present day   with Islamic terrorists fighting the CIA on American soil. Yet its plot felt hyperbolic and out of touch with reality. The lure of dramatic embellishment also holds back other popular shows about domestic terrorism such as Homeland and 24, which offer escapist fantasies about American security measures but struggle to top each increasingly outlandish plot point with events that are even more extreme.",

        "content": "Urban cemeteries emerged in the 19th Century in response to cities  exploding populations. Jonathan Glancey looks at the history of these final resting places. The word cemetery, derived from ancient Greek, means a sleeping place. So, those countless inscriptions found in city cemeteries reading Gone to Sleep or Rest in Peace make perfect sense. Here, bodies lie in rows beneath stone and marble monuments as if asleep in secret dormitories. And   except for those susceptible to images from horror stories or George A Romero s Night of the Living Dead   cemeteries, as different as San Michele, the Venetian island graveyard, and Calvary Cemetery, Queens, with its tombs of Italian mobsters overlooking Manhattan   are truly restful places offering a sense of reverie and otherworldly escape from the teeming towns and cities they serve. The works of skilled landscape designers, architects, sculptors, letter carvers and gardeners, city cemeteries can be heartbreakingly beautiful. And, yet, although often havens for wildlife, compelling essays in the history of taste and design, and fascinating glimpses into social conventions and religious creeds, the genesis of cemeteries was a frightening one. Until the 19th Century, it was normal to bury the urban dead in churchyards. As the population of industrial cities in Europe skyrocketed, far too many corpses were shoe-horned into already crammed graveyards. These contaminated water supplies and horrific cholera epidemics ravaged cities.",

        "content": "We think of the Greeks as the orderly people who gave us drama, democracy and philosophy. But the fearsome creatures in Hellenic art reveal a dark side, writes Alastair Sooke. What do you think about when you hear the words  ancient Greece ? The conventional view is that the ancient Greeks provided the bedrock for Western civilisation. After all, they invented democracy, philosophy and drama. But it would be a mistake to imagine them as exclusively rational. Their society was shaped by strange and primal forces as much as the guiding light of reason. And nowhere is this more visible than in their art. One of the most intriguing aspects of ancient Greek art is its glut of fantastical creatures. When we consider Greek art, we tend to envisage marble statues of Olympian gods   but gorgons, griffins, centaurs and sphinxes are actually just as common. Lots of them were on show recently in New York, decorating all sorts of objects in the Metropolitan Museum of Art s exhibition Assyria to Iberia at the Dawn of the Classical Age. What was the significance of all these ferocious supernatural beasts? Fantastical animals were already part of the repertoire of Aegean craftsmen in prehistory, a millennium before the high point of the classical age in Athens in the Fifth Century BC. For instance, they star in the art of both the Minoan and Mycenaean civilisations of the Bronze Age. The famous  Throne Room  in the Minoan palace at Knossos on Crete was decorated with frescoes of elegant griffins   hybrid creatures with the bodies of lions and the heads of birds of prey. They flanked the chamber s so-called throne, as though conferring supernatural power upon whoever sat there.",

        "title": "Evelyn Nesbit: The world s first supermodel",
        "content": "Evelyn Nesbit achieved great fame more than a century ago as a model. She revolutionised cultural life, writes Lindsay Baker. What makes a supermodel? A preternatural beauty, of course, but there is more   a certain charisma, an unerring fashion instinct, a steely resilience, sex appeal. And a mere model becomes a  super  when she becomes not only stratospherically famous, but also when she somehow encapsulates her era. The supermodel provides a snapshot of a moment in time because she is always at the epicentre of the fashionable cultural life of her time   and at its vanguard. Every decade has their supers, from impish, mini-skirted, swinging- 60s icons Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy to quirky Cara Delevingne today. But the phenomenon goes back further than Twiggy, to the very start of the 20th Century, when the world s first ever supermodel rose to fame. Evelyn Nesbit, a willowy, copper-haired beauty from Philadelphia, was the most sought-after artists  and fashion model in America s Gilded Age. Her life was turbulent and eventful, and her fame peaked when she became embroiled in a murder, and what was then dubbed  the trial of the century . Nesbit embodied her era in more ways than one. The late 19th Century was a glamorous period of rapid economic growth in the US but it was also an era of considerable poverty, as many poor European immigrants poured in. Nesbit in her lifetime saw both sides. She came from a modest Scots-Irish background in Tarentum, Pennsylvania, and after her father died leaving debts, her mother struggled to support the family. It was also an age with one foot still in the starchy Victorian era and one just about to step into the permissive Roaring  20s. The young Evelyn was from a  respectable  family, and modelled   fully dressed   for artists from the age of 14, as a way out of poverty for the whole family. When she came to New York in 1900, her rise was meteoric. But she was also stepping into a new, different world. James Carroll Beckwith, whose main patron was John Jacob Astor, took her under his wing, introduced her to artists and illustrators, and Nesbit was soon the most in-demand model in New York. She was the inspiration for numerous art works, including sculptor George Grey Barnard s famous piece Innocence (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Charles Dana Gibson s Women: The Eternal Question (1905). She was a popular face too on the illustrated covers of many journals and magazines, among them Vanity Fair, Harper s Bazaar, The Delineator and Ladies  Home Journal, and her likeness was also to be found advertising everything from face creams to toothpastes. In demand Nesbitt s soft-featured, youthful face soon became ubiquitous, to be seen on postcards, tobacco cards, calendars and chromolithographs. She often posed for illustrators in costume   a wood nymph, a gypsy, a Grecian goddess, a geisha girl   she was always clothed and the resulting images were not overtly sexual, though there was a pin-up suggestiveness about them that no doubt contributed to their popularity   and Nesbit s celebrity.",

        "content": "John Singer Sargent s infamous portrait scandalised late-19th Century Paris. But who was the woman in the painting? Jason Farago investigates. She looks off to the right, staring out into the middle distance, her mouth shut tight, her dainty nose directed ever so slightly downward. Her right hand rests upon a bare wooden table, while her left hand, decorated with a wedding ring, clutches a folded fan. Her hair is twisted up, away from her shoulders   which are bare save for two straps, somewhat unconvincingly holding up her cinched, classical black gown. On her head is a little diamond tiara, but other than that and the ring she wears no jewelry. Between her long neck and the plunging, heart-shaped neckline of her dress lie acres of flesh, as cold and pale as ice milk. John Singer Sargent s portrait of the so-called  Madame X , painted in 1884 and now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, has attracted and repelled generations of gallery-goers. The stern face and the pseudonymous title have made her into a figure of mystery, an American Mona Lisa of inscrutable character. But her mystery, her anonymity, is not the result of lost historical documents or the covering of artistic footprints. Madame X, so alluring and so enigmatic, was once a bona fide celebrity   before it all came crashing down. John Singer Sargent s Portrait of Madame X caused a massive scandal upon its debut in Paris in 1884, in part because it emphasised the sexual allure of a married woman (Wikipedia) She was born Virginie Am lie Avegno, the daughter of white Creole parents in New Orleans. Her father died fighting for the Confederacy at the Battle of Shiloh in 1862. In 1866 her young brother died too, of congestive fever. Her widowed mother had had enough, and after taking out loans on the family plantation she left with her daughter to Paris in 1867. The City of Light must have seemed like a daydream after the devastation of the Civil War and the travails of Reconstruction that were just beginning. But Am lie had been brought to Paris for more than that. She was there to get married, big time   which she promptly did, to a banker more than twice her age, Pierre Gautreau. She was beguiling. Not conventionally pretty, she nevertheless cut a striking figure with her thin lips and extreme pallor; according to one Sargent biographer, she not only covered herself with powder, but also consumed arsenic to sap her skin of colour. (It was actually a less toxic substance .)  I remember seeing Madame de Gautrot [sic], the noted beauty of the day, and could not help stalking her as one does a deer,  wrote the American expatriate artist Edward Simmons.  Her head and neck undulated like that of a young doe . Every artist wanted to make her in marble or paint.  Yet though she had public admirers and a packet of money, she still struggled to climb to the top of Parisian society; the gossip pages took only limited notice of her, and as a Creole she would have been excluded from the highest echelons of the French beau monde. She, and her ambitious mother, were keen to make her name. And the young John Singer Sargent, who had commissions from fellow expats but craved French acceptance, was keen to make his. So there they were, the American society madam and the American painter, both in their late 20s, both eager for their big break. It took 30 sessions, and, as he would throughout his career, Sargent chose the dress: the little black number, which might actually be a two-piece skirt and bodice brutally drawn in at the waist, with severe d colletage. And   as a preparatory sketch in the Tate s collection shows   she originally appeared with one of the dress s straps missing. That bare shoulder, plus the wedding ring on her left hand, made a scandalous combination. It signified, not very subtly, that this married woman would look kindly on introductions from other men.",

        "content": "A historian claims Bach s wife wrote some of his works. That s up for debate, but these 10 female composers deserve recognition, Clemency Burton-Hill argues. Scandal threatened to rock the classical music world recently when a music historian named Professor Martin Jarvis reasserted his explosive theory that some of JS Bach s music was in fact written by his second wife, Anna Magdalena. His new documentary, Written By Mrs Bach, is described on its distributor s website as a  300 year old mystery and detective story , which incurs the  wrath of scholars worldwide  as it  challenges and confronts the myths surrounding Johann Sebastian Bach . Supported by  stunning visual forensic evidence , it claims that the handwriting in some of the original Bach manuscripts was not that of a mere transcriber or copyist, as we had previously understood Anna Magdalena to be, but bears the hallmarks of a mind in the act of creation. Over the years, plenty of minor works by JS Bach have been reattributed to others, with little furore. So why is this causing such a stir? Not only are the pieces in question some of Bach s greatest   including some of the Cello Suites and Well-Tempered Clavier   but the suggestion they might have been written by a woman rather than another man is raising the musical patriarchy s collective hackles. How could Anna Magdalena have written such sublime things, given she had over a dozen children to attend to, not to mention domestic duties galore? As critic Ivan Hewett notes, Bach s wife would also  have had to defy one of the strongest prejudices of her era , namely that  Woman, a lesser sort of being made from Adam s spare rib, couldn t possibly be creative. She could sing and play music, but only men could do the serious intellectual business of writing the stuff.  If Professor Jarvis  thesis turns out to be true, Hewett muses, it  puts a bomb right at the heart of the old patriarchal view of the Western tradition . Ever since Hildegard von Bingen in the 12th Century, women   as in other art forms   have made a significant contribution to classical music which has often been overlooked. This is not just a great injustice on an individual level to those creative and brilliant humans, but a shame for music history in general. Whether Anna Magdalena was the  real  Bach behind some of that glorious music or not, let s hope Professor Jarvis  arguments can inspire and empower classical-music-inclined females to slip out from their male counterparts  shadows. Because goodness knows we in classical music need our Beyonc s and our Taylor Swifts more than ever. Here are 10 undersung female composers who should be recognised for their contributions to the classical canon. 1. Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179)",

Stephen Glass Apologises Hanna Rosin | New Republic | 10 November 2014 For its centenary issue, the New Republic seeks out the seemingly brilliant young journalist who almost destroyed the magazine in the 1990s when his many attention-grabbing stories turned out to be elaborate fabrications. Two decades later, Glass lives in Venice Beach, California, and works for a law firm. He appears to be a thoroughly reformed character. But, given the history, is he just acting out a show of remorse to win back trust?",

        "content": "How German films depict the Nazis For decades after World War II, German filmmakers avoided the subject. But that has now changed, and one new film addresses the period with great sensitivity, reports Christian Blauvelt.  Just bury everything. Don t talk about anything. No one knew anything. Just look forward, don t discuss. We have a lot to do with building up the country.  That s how actress Nina Hoss describes the attitude of many Germans, and German filmmakers in particular, in the first few decades after World War II.  It worked well to not look at it, what had happened in this country,  she says. But in the past 15 years, that attitude has changed dramatically, and German filmmakers have turned their cameras on the nation s darkest hour in films and TV miniseries like Downfall and Generation War. Christian Petzold s Phoenix is one of the latest German films to address the war and its aftermath, and it was a sensation at the Toronto Film Festival. It stars Hoss as a Jewish woman who survived imprisonment in a concentration camp and searches the rubble of post-war Berlin for her husband, who may have betrayed her to the Nazis. Petzold, a prominent member of the Berlin School of filmmakers, wanted his film to empathise with the victims of the Nazis rather than tell another story about the Nazis themselves. Reporting for Talking Movies, Christian Blauvelt examines the recent slate of German films about World War II and the difficulties German filmmakers face when depicting the period.

In recent months, New Yorkers have campaigned   successfully   for the preservation of a huge neon sign that, for decades, has blazed over Brooklyn s Ninth Street advertising  Kentile Floors . As part of a redevelopment programme, the sign will be moved elsewhere, celebrating not so much the products of a synthetic flooring factory that ceased operations in the early 1990s, but an enduring love affair for neon shared by people from cities around the world. Writing in the New York Times, Ginia Bellafante says that the tiles made by Kentile Floors contained asbestos and, as a result,  the company faced years of litigation from plaintiffs who contended its products were responsible for cases of cancer and other dangerous illnesses . Bellafante sees the campaign for the Brooklyn sign as  an extension of creative class fetish for the workingman s life, the same sensibility that has resulted in the fashion for Carhartt jackets, Esso shirts, trucker caps, factory paraphernalia and so on among recent graduates of better Eastern colleges   the ultimate symbols of denied privilege.  New Yorkers campaigned to save the iconic Kentile Floors sign in Brooklyn (Randy Duchaine/Alamy) Perhaps. And yet, there s something else about Kentile Floors and other venerable neon signs that attracts so many of us no matter what they were originally designed to sell: they attract the eye like fireworks. They animate city centres. They evoke nostalgic worlds of 1930s cocktail bars, speakeasy diners, sensual nightclubs and the sheer excitement of going downtown.

Imagine the history of fairy tales as a map: unfurl this imaginary terrain in your mind s eye, and you will first see two prominent landmarks, Charles Perrault s Tales of Olden Times (1697) and a little nearer in the foreground, the Grimm Brothers  Children s and Household Tales (1812 57). These collections dominate their surroundings so imposingly that they make it hard to pick out other features near or far. Gradually, however, as your eyes adjust to the dazzle, several more features of the scene begin to grow in definition and give you better bearings: along a whole web of routes from points further east, The Tales of the Thousand and One Nights form deep aquifers of story running through the entire expanse, and emerging here and there in waterfalls and powerful rivers spreading through wide floodplains. Harbours and market-places and pilgrimage sites   Venice, Naples, Genoa, Sicily, in Italy alone   begin to emerge as significant centres of talkative storytelling populations. To the north, Hans Christian Andersen s glowing Danish homeland is emitting powerful signals from regions stretching to the Arctic Circle. And when your eyes track his large force field, you begin to discover beacons blazing in the darkness, lit by the work of Walter Scott in Scotland, Alexander Afanasyev in Russia, and other omnivores of their countries  stories.

At a time of decline in religious faith and amid an industrial revolution that changed landscapes and cities forever, artists in the Low Countries began to look inwards, turning art into a new kind of religion. The most famous artist to come out of the Netherlands and Belgium in the 19th Century, Vincent van Gogh s biography is well-known: the tortured man who cut off his ear in despair; the troubled soul who found ecstasy in the beauty of the French landscape. After unsucessfully attempting a career in the church, Van Gogh discovered his true calling in painting:  I ve found my work  he wrote in an early letter,  something which I live for heart and soul.  Andrew Graham-Dixon explains how the painter transformed everyday images of nature into visions of divine beauty, reaching a climax in his most famous subject: sunflowers. He painted the flowers in a fit of enthusiasm, the thick daubes of paint resembling, Graham-Dixon says,  the hot, peppery, garlic-infused mayonnaise  called aioli.

I was living in Hitler s private apartment in Munich when his death was announced.  These words came not from a high-ranking Nazi officer or a hardened Allied soldier, but from a fashion model-turned-photographer. Lee Miller   who became the muse and lover of Surrealist artist Man Ray during the early 1930s after appearing on the cover of Vogue   was one of a small number of female combat photographers embedded with Allied troops in WWII. Her account of their advance in Western Europe has been put together from manuscripts, negatives and contact sheets for the new book Lee Miller s War: Beyond D-Day. After her death in 1977, Miller s son Antony Penrose discovered the records in trunks in her attic. In the book s afterword, he describes finding  maps still splattered with Alsatian mud, captions and notes scribbled on scraps of paper, orders and passes from the military, looted souvenirs . Miller s photographs and reports appeared as spreads in Vogue between 1944 and 1945.  The gore and violence of her articles feature boldly in the pages,  says Penrose.  The grim skeletal corpses of Buchenwald are separated by a few thicknesses of paper from delightful recipes to be prepared by beautiful women dressed in sumptuous gowns.  Evacuating wounded in Normandy (Lee Miller archives, England 2014.

The ward was like a jungle of banyan trees. A maze of hanging rubber tubes swaying in khaki shadow   one to the nostril and one to the wound of each man.  Miller s description of an evacuation hospital near Omaha beach in Normandy was published in the fashion magazine in August 1944.

In 1878, a year after he created the phonograph, US inventor Thomas Edison noted that the cylinder could be rotated backwards to pleasing effect:  the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way . Since avant-garde musicians in the 1950s first experimented with tape recorders, editing together sound fragments in a style called  musique concr te , messages have been inserted into songs that only become clear once they are played backwards. But which are the best, and which are just myths? Pop will eat itself This video is no longer available Death metal bands don t hold the monopoly on hidden messages: one pop group has been at the centre of rumours for nearly five decades. The Beatles first stumbled across what is called  backmasking    recording a message backwards onto a track   when they were making their Rubber Soul album in 1965. Influenced by the techniques of musique concr te, they featured a backmasked line in Rain, a single released in 1966. Featuring in the fade-out, the reversed vocal is the first line of the song.  On the end of Rain you hear me singing it backwards,  John Lennon told Rolling Stone magazine in 1968.  We'd done the main thing at EMI and the habit was then to take the songs home and see what you thought a little extra gimmick or what the guitar piece would be. So I got home about five in the morning, stoned out of my head, I staggered up to my tape recorder and I put it on, but it came out backwards, and I was in a trance in the earphones, what is it   what is it? It's too much, you know, and I really wanted the whole song backwards almost, and that was it. So we tagged it on the end.  Right to reply",

Once life became more than chasing beasts, running away from bigger beasts, occasional mating and surviving ice ages, things got complicated. Once your life became a little more secure, you had to work out how to live your life. And so, philosophers. Socrates was facing execution when he laid down the challenge to succeeding generations and urged his fellow Athenians to pay more attention to the upkeep of their own souls (it s where we get the word psychotherapy). Since then, as knowledge has vastly expanded, living  the good life  has become an idea scrutinised by sects, cults, gurus and self-proclaimed self-help messiahs. Do the right thing One group, named after the street on which they hung around preaching, came to be known as the Stoics. Their founder, Zeno, suggested that our emotions are shaped by our thoughts, our feelings by our opinions, that we had free will, that we can change and that the key to a good life was to be virtuous and to think in harmony with nature. What chimes with a lot of modern self-help is that attaining happiness is an active endeavour. Happiness can only come through thinking about what the right thing to do is and then acting on that.

The periscope broke through the water. The U-boat captain had to be quick: he had just a few seconds to find his target and fire. And then the ship he was tracking appeared to break up, jolt, change direction. The torpedo missed. That was the idea, anyway. The scientist John Graham Kerr first suggested the use of camouflage to make it difficult to calculate a ship s course in 1914, but it was an artist who developed the technique. British marine painter and poster artist Norman Wilkinson was inspired to create  dazzle  camouflage after serving as a Royal Navy volunteer in a submarine patrol at Gallipoli and on a minesweeping ship off the British coast. Instead of attempting to render warships invisible, he aimed to confuse the enemy with contrasting colours and shapes that distorted the ship s form and obscured its movement in the water. The troopship USS Leviathan, 1918. (Hirz/Frederic Lewis/Archive Photos/Getty Images) Now the optical illusions have been revived as part of a series of art commissions celebrating the centenary of World War I. Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez has created a new work for a historic pilot ship in Liverpool, and in London today, Tobias Rehberger unveiled his transformation of the HMS President, which served as a  dazzle ship  during the conflict. The German sculptor won the Golden Lion award at the 53rd International Venice Biennale with a cafe he created using the principles of dazzle painting. Although Wilkinson s own artwork was traditional   he was commissioned to create paintings for the smoking rooms on the Titanic   his dazzle designs have been compared to the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Curves on the hull of a ship could create the impression of a wave, shapes on smokestacks suggested the ship was facing another direction, and patterns at bow and stern made it hard to see which was which.",

For the technically or mathematically minded, a geodesic dome is a spherical structure composed of triangular elements forming part of a network of circles, or  geodesics , on the surface of a given sphere. This description might seem a little mind-bending, yet for New Age Americans in the 1960s and  70s, the geodesic dome, for all its formal complexity, represented freedom, the potential to create a wholly new form of lightweight structure that, theoretically, could be placed anywhere within the United States. The idea of a home that could be manufactured in a factory and flown by helicopter to any suitable plot of land had long been a dream of the US inventor Richard Buckminster Fuller. Born in 1895, Fuller was a more or less a practical dreamer. Expelled twice from Harvard, he took on such unlikely jobs as a labourer in a stockyard and commander of a crash rescue boat in World War I before finding funds   through persuasion and charm   to develop a number of prototypes for factory made homes. He called these radical devices Dymaxion houses. Fuller believed they would sell like Model-T Fords, but they never quite caught on. Fuller even developed a Dymaxion car that was like no other that has been seen on US roads or anywhere else since. The British architect Norman Foster has recently had a replica built of this enormous, three-wheel, streamlined Buck Rogers-style car. Originally, only three were built.",

        "content": "The invention of the elevator enabled a whole new type of architecture   and had a profound effect on our culture, writes Jonathan Glancey. Scary stories about elevators are a dime a dozen: lurid tales about lifts are ten a penny. Lifts and elevators are, of course, one and the same thing, yet whatever you choose to call them, they have long evoked fears of being trapped inside or of plunging to death down dark, vertiginous shafts. A gift to filmmakers, the elevator was as its nastiest in De Lift, a 1983 Dutch shocker directed by Dick Maas in which an elevator fitted with a bio-computer brain finds nasty ways to kill those unwittingly foolish enough to ride it. As an antidote, watch Alfred Hitchcock s North by Northwest. In one scene of this immeasurably stylish 1959 thriller, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), an advertising executive mistaken for a spy rides a busy hotel lift along with his mother, hotel guests and a pair of murderous bad guys. The tension is broken when mother says, ever so politely,  You gentlemen aren t really trying to kill my son, are you?  Cue polite and then increasingly hysterical laughter from those crowded in to the lift including the thwarted gunmen   as Grant stares grimly ahead. The famous moment from North by Northwest when Roger Thornhill s mother single-handedly foils a plot to kill her son in a hotel lift (MGM) Lifts have engendered such heightened fears and emotions ever since Elisha Graves Otis demonstrated his elevator safety brake at the New York Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations in 1853. Standing on a high platform, this showman-inventor ordered the rope holding him up severed with an axe. Almost before the crowd below had time to gasp, the lift would grind to a sudden halt. Repeated many times, this theatrical demonstration convinced the world that lifts were safe. They had existed for at least 2000 years   Vitruvius, the first century Roman architect, noted a design for one by Archimedes dating from around 235BC   but Otis proved they were safe for everyday use.",

        "content": "What is striking, though, is the limited nature of the museum s mission. Early visitors have described the wrenching experience of its permanent collection galleries as if they were reliving that awful day, but there is little about the causes of 9/11, except for a short film that has been widely criticized as Islamophobic.. Holland Cotter, the New York Times s co-chief art critic, noted that the museum s depiction of 9/11 is  not so much wrong as drastically incomplete,  offering  news, not analysis.  And, if it remains so, the museum might not have the importance for future generations that it does for ours. A steel beam from the original World Trade Center stands at the center of the Foundation Hall of the museum (Getty Images) Very few museums focus with such single-mindedness on one disaster or one historical crime: Holocaust museums, say, or the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. Even battlefield sites, such as the Gettysburg Museum in Pennsylvania, regularly take in larger remits than the single event that happened at the site. That s for good reason. Museums do best when they not only narrate history, but place it in context and set it in motion. The Smithsonian, for example, does not recount the history of slavery in a standalone institution; slavery is right in the middle of the National Museum of American History. And that s as it should be   the history of the United States is inseparable from the history of slavery, and to separate the part from the whole would diminish both. In context With an event as traumatic as 9/11, whose history is still being written and whose victims are still among us, a more capacious view might be difficult. (And there is some history here. In 2005, George Pataki   the former New York governor and the great villain of the World Trade Center s reconstruction, who also overruled his own jury s recommendations for the site s design   evicted a planned historical museum from the 9/11 museum s site, which conservatives bashed as a  blame America monument. ) But even the greatest traumas, with the greatest need for respect and remembrance, offer room for context. One excellent case study is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Even while the museum insists on the uniqueness and irreducibility of the Holocaust, it also looks more broadly at anti-Semitism and discrimination, as well as at other genocides and war crimes, some dismayingly recent. The museum s permanent exhibition, with its searing display of thousands of victims  shoes, has lost none of its force in the decades since it opened. But it has also presented exhibitions related to Bosnia, Darfur, and most impressively Rwanda   a genocide with horrible parallels to the Holocaust, and which the museum has researched in depth since 1994. Last month, museum officials traveled to Kigali for the 20th anniversary commemorations of the Rwandan genocide; accompanying them was Margit Meissner, a Holocaust survivor. Alice Greenwald, the director of the 9/11 museum, is a veteran of Washington s Holocaust museum. Having steered the new institution to this week s opening, I hope that she thinks about the successes of her previous one, and begins to imagine ways in which the atrocious events of 9/11 could be placed in their historical epoch, rather than shown as an event wrenched out of time. Maybe the political risks are too formidable, and maybe it s too soon: Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, who has admitted to planning the 9/11 attacks, is still being held at Guant namo Bay, where his trial is once again delayed. But in a few years, perhaps, the museum may be ready to look beyond the few hours of that Tuesday in September and take into its narrative all the stories that came before and since: the attacks in Madrid and London and Bali, the ongoing revelations about government surveillance, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. That would be the best way to ensure that 9/11 retains its relevance when the millions of us who lived through it are gone, and it is left to New Yorkers born after 2001 to educate the living and commemorate the dead.",

        "content": "The truth is that despite frenzied speculation (was she the artist s daughter, or perhaps his mistress?), we will probably never know the identity of the model for Vermeer s Girl   if there even was one. Vermeer, himself, is a shadowy figure in the history of art. Once nicknamed  the sphinx of Delft , his native town which he never left, he produced little   only around three dozen paintings are today agreed to be by him. He also left behind few biographical traces, though we do know that his wife bore him 15 children. He is recognised as a master of light who specialised in painting women in sparse domestic interiors, and his pictures are prized in part because they are often suffused with mystery. Unlike some of his Dutch contemporaries, who crammed their compositions full of material objects and narrative detail, Vermeer got a kick out of teasing the viewer and withholding meaning. In one of his canvases, for instance, an elegant couple is engaged in a music lesson   but is the gentleman her tutor, a suitor, or her lover? We will never know. As for his Girl, well, she is even more perplexing. As Emilie Gordenker, the director of the Mauritshuis, told me recently, 17th-Century viewers would have looked at Vermeer s painting and seen not a portrait but a type of picture known as a  tronie .  A  tronie  is a study of a head and shoulders dressed in exotic clothing,  she explains. The giveaway is the turban: it lends an oriental flavour to the canvas, transporting viewers to a faraway realm of the imagination.  While it is possible that someone modelled for it,  Gordenker says,  just as Rubens often painted figures who looked like his wife, it isn t meant to be a specific person, but someone more generalised, timeless and mysterious   perhaps a sibyl or a figure from the Bible.  Moreover, according to one theory, the impossible pearl, which is too big to be worn in reality, was meant to be understood as a piece of costume jewellery   so adding to the general atmosphere of artifice and make-believe. For Gordenker, this  sense of mystery  is what attracts people to the Girl.  Partly, she s just gorgeous   that s easy,  she says.  But the composition is also very clever. Out of that dark background, she pops into our space looking very much alive   and the gesture is a big part of that. Her mouth is open, which you don t see that much in Dutch paintings, so she seems as if she is about to talk to you. I m dying to know what she s going to say. And around the world   in Japan, in the United States, in Italy   everybody has the same reaction: you can see them trying to fill in the story.   The image works because it is unresolved,  agrees Tracy Chevalier, whose novel about the painting has sold more than three million copies.  You can t ever answer the question of what she s thinking or how she s feeling. If it were resolved, then you d move onto the next painting. But it isn t, so you turn back to it again and again, trying to unlock that mystery. That s what all masterpieces do: we long to understand them, but we never will.  Lost and found The curious thing, though, is that it hasn t always been this way. A hundred years ago, visitors to the Mauritshuis were more eager to see Paulus Potter s gargantuan canvas The Bull (1647), which, with its massive, mud-spattered bovine protagonist, was prized as the last word in Dutch naturalism. Back then Vermeer s Girl was more wallflower than superstar.",

        "title": "How Giuseppe Verdi s music helped bring Italy together",
        "content": "Verdi s operas are well known   but what about his work as a member of parliament and fervent supporter of Italian unification? On the eve of the composer s 200th anniversary, Clemency Burton-Hill looks back at Verdi s life and times. Can you imagine any country today in national mourning over the death of a classical composer? When Giuseppe Verdi, born 200 years ago next week, died in January 1901, Italy wept as one. Almost a quarter of a million people took to the streets, marching to Va, Pensiero from Nabucco   better known as the Chorus of Hebrew Slaves   sung by a massed choir under the baton of celebrated maestro Arturo Toscanini. Verdi was a truly great composer: there is no question about it. Along with an eternal Requiem, some ravishing sacred choral music and a few notable chamber and orchestral works, there are of course the thirty-odd operas, at least twenty of which are in the core operatic canon. More than any year in recent memory, 2013 has seen a succession of major composers  anniversaries   Benjamin Britten s centenary, the bicentenary of Richard Wagner s birth, the four-hundredth anniversary of Gesualdo s grisly death   and it is noticeable that, in comparison to the festivities arranged for these other dates, the Verdi bicentenary has scarcely made an impact. This is not an indication of the esteem in which he is held; it merely reflects the fact that his music is performed all the time anyway, all over the world. It s a pretty safe bet that, on any given night, someone somewhere will be singing Rigoletto or Otello, Aida or Violetta. But the reason the Italians took to the streets that wintry day at the dawn of the last century was about much more than just music. Verdi s operas had provided the soundtrack to the politically tempestuous half-century that preceded his death, and his most famous arias had become quasi-anthems for a nation recently unified. When Nabucco had its premiere at La Scala in 1842,  Italy  was simply a cluster of geographically contiguous kingdoms and principalities with little more to unite them than a common language. So when Italians sang the Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves at Verdi s funeral procession, it wasn t just because it was a catchy tune they knew the words to. Its subject   the Israelites giving poignant voice to their longing for the promised land   had become a powerful analogue for the long-frustrated desires of the Italian people. When they cried  Viva Verdi!  during the funeral procession, they were still acutely conscious of the slogan s double meaning and its clandestine resonance for the agitators of  the Risorgimento , as the cause of Italian nationalism was known. The letters VERDI also spelled out the name of the King of Sardinia who, in 1861, finally took the throne of a unified nation for the first time since the 6th Century   Victor Emmanuele Re D Italia. That same year, at the request of the new Prime Minister Camillo Cavour, Verdi entered the country s very first parliament, in which he served for four years. Call me uncharitable, but I suspect the likes of Silvio Berlusconi (or Enrico Letta, or Mario Monti) would be hard pressed to name a contemporary classical composer, let alone invite them into the big tent of government.

        "content": "Alastair Sooke looks through the ultimate Renaissance man s anatomical sketchbooks   scientific masterpieces full of lucid insights into the functioning of the human body. We tend to think of Leonardo da Vinci as a painter, even though he probably produced no more than 20 pictures before his death in 1519. Yet for long periods of his career, which lasted for nearly half a century, he was engrossed in all sorts of surprising pursuits, from stargazing and designing ingenious weaponry to overseeing a complex system of canals for Ludovico Maria Sforza, the ruling duke of Milan. During the course of his life, Leonardo filled thousands of pages of manuscript with dense doodles, diagrams, and swirling text, probing almost every conceivable topic. Not for nothing, then, is he often considered the archetypal Renaissance man: as the great British art historian Kenneth Clark put it, Leonardo was the most relentlessly curious person in history. Yet according to Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Man, a new exhibition at the Edinburgh International Festival, one area of scientific endeavour piqued Leonardo s curiosity arguably more than any other: human anatomy. Leonardo s interest in anatomy began when he was working for Ludovico in Milan.  On the 2nd day of April 1489 , as he wrote at the head of a page in a new notebook, he sat down to begin his  Book entitled On the Human Figure . After executing a sequence of stunning drawings of a skull, though, his studies went into abeyance, probably because he lacked access to corpses that he could dissect. Bodies of evidence But his ambitions to publish a comprehensive treatise on human anatomy persisted   and around two decades later, he returned to his otherwise unused notebook, which is now known as the Anatomical Manuscript B and is kept at the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. In it he made a number of pen-and-ink drawings recording his observations while dissecting an old man who had died in a hospital in Florence in the winter of 1507-08. In the years that followed, Leonardo concentrated on human anatomy more systematically than ever before   and by the end of his life he claimed that he had cut up more than 30 corpses. In the winter of 1510-11, while probably collaborating with a young professor of anatomy called Marcantonio della Torre at the University of Pavia, Leonardo compiled a series of 18 mostly double-sided sheets exploding with more than 240 individual drawings and over 13,000 words of notes. Now known as the Anatomical Manuscript A, and also in the Royal Collection, these sheets are full of lucid insights into the functioning anatomy of the human body.",

        "content": "Fifty years ago, Martin Luther King s speech defined America s civil rights struggle. And it was a song by soul singer Mahalia Jackson that stole the show. Mahalia Jackson took America to church 50 years ago. Minutes before her friend Martin Luther King Jr. announced  I have a dream  to cap the March on Washington DC on 28 August 1963, Sister Mahalia reminded the 250,000 citizens spread out in front of the Lincoln Memorial of the long road they had travelled.  You know my soul looks back in wonder, how I got over,  she sang, praising the heavens for allowing her people to make it this far. But their struggle was far from over. A Hammond organ simmered, and rhythmic handclapping broke out as the singer closed her eyes and rhapsodised. In the past, the gospel classic How I Got Over had allowed her to cut loose for 10, even 15 minutes at a time as she worked church aisles and reached into the pews to grasp hands and anoint foreheads. She had recorded several versions of the song, but they were relatively tame compared to the heights she could reach in front of a congregation. Now, in the minutes before King was to speak, it was once again Holy Ghost time   the type of performance where Jackson surrendered not just her voice but her body to the moment, bending and twisting her robust frame as she reached for the notes. The legendary singer would be the final musical performer on a day in which the civil rights movement mingled with folk music and gospel in front of a national audience   not just the quarter-million assembled to hear King speak about job equality and voting rights, but millions more watching on television and listening on the radio. Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Odetta, the Freedom Singers and Marian Anderson also had performed, but it was Jackson who seized the day with a song that had particularly deep resonance in the African-American community. Pioneer of protest There is some dispute about the exact origins of How I Got Over. Reverend William Herbert Brewster is often credited with writing the song, though it was reinterpreted and popularized by Clara Ward and her family gospel group, the Famous Ward Sisters. In a memoir written by Ward s sister, Willa, she claims the song was inspired by a racial incident in Georgia during the early  50s while the family was travelling between performances. The Wards rode in a Cadillac, which drew unwanted attention from a group of whites, who blocked the road and viciously taunted the passengers. Only a feigned speaking-in-tongues seizure by the family matriarch, Gertrude Ward, prevented the incident from turning even uglier, and possibly deadly, Willa wrote in How I Got Over: Clara Ward and the World-Famous Ward Singers. The whites scattered when they saw Gertrude writhing, shaking and babbling.",

        "content": "An idea that came from Hitler would become the best-selling car of all time. Jonathan Glancey explains our enduring love for the Volkswagen Beetle. In 1945, a rare and curious Volkswagen car was shipped from its bomb-damaged German factory to England. Here, a commission of leading British motor manufacturers, chaired by Sir William Rootes, inspected the small, streamlined saloon. It would be  quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer , the commission reported.  It is too ugly and noisy , while  to build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.  This damning judgement proved as ill founded as that of Decca record bosses who, in 1962, declared  The Beatles have no future in show business , and turned the mop-tops down. Since then, global sales of highly lucrative Beatles  albums have topped two billion. The Volkswagen Beetle, meanwhile, with its friendly styling by the Austrian designer Erwin Komenda, and innovative engineering by Ferdinand Porsche, became the best-selling car of all time. Production of the Beetle outstripped that of Henry Ford s Model-T when the 15,007,034th car rolled off the line at Wolfsburg in 1972. The very last Beetles were made in Mexico in 2003 by when more than 21.5 million had been built worldwide. As its name made clear, the Volkswagen was truly a  People s Car , and, although many modifications were made between 1945 and 2003, the first and last Beetles were clearly peas in the the same mechanical pod. Star vehicle The remarkable thing about the Beetle is not just the sheer number of sales, but the fact that a car developed from an idea of Adolf Hitler s was to become as loved by Californian surf dudes, college kids and free lovin  hippies as it was desired by fervent Nazis. Herbie   the anthropomorphic star of six Hollywood movies beginning with The Love Bug in 1968   was the same car German families had saved up for before Hitler s invasion of Poland dashed their hopes. Ultimately, the sheer quality, along with the affordability, reliability, economy and distinct look and feel of the Beetle, ensured its success. It had, though, been touch and go for Volkswagen in 1945. Although the car had been on the drawing board since 1934, following a meeting between Hitler and Porsche, the Volkswagen failed to get into production before the war.",

        "content": "He murdered his wife and her lover, was tried for witchcraft and dabbled in sadomasochism. But it is for his glorious music, not his grisly crimes, that we should remember Carlo Gesualdo, writes Clemency Burton-Hill.  Irrefutably badass  is not the obvious phrase to reach for when discussing a late-Renaissance lutenist and composer whose output was chiefly a capella madrigals and settings of sacred texts. But it is how Alex Ross, the esteemed critic of The New Yorker describes Don Carlo Gesualdo, who died 400 years ago this week   and badass Gesualdo indisputably was, both as a musician and as a man. A figure of fascination over the years for artists as diverse as Igor Stravinsky, Aldous Huxley, Bernardo Bertolucci and Werner Herzog, the continuing fixation on Gesualdo four centuries after his death is not surprising when you consider the grisly and gruesome details of his biography. We tend to think of classical music as a rather staid affair; its practitioners generally well-behaved servants at court who busy themselves with counterpoint and harmony, not murder and sadism. Gesualdo, on the other hand, lived a life   and death   that the most luridly resourceful director of slasher B-movies might struggle to dream up. A prince and nobleman from a prominent aristocratic family in the Kingdom of Naples, at 20 Gesualdo married his 24-year-old first cousin, the legendarily alluring Maria d Avalos, who already had two marriages behind her. Both husbands are said to have expired  in excess of connubial bliss . One fateful night in October 1590, Gesualdo discovered her in flagrante with the Duke of Andria, Don Fabrizio Carafa (he was wearing Maria s silk nightgown at the time). Gesualdo immediately set about slaughtering the pair, slashing their limbs with his sword, mutilating their sexual organs, and puncturing their skulls with the bullets of his gun. He then allegedly murdered the baby boy who may or may not have been his or Don Fabrizio s child by swinging him to death in his castle courtyard. Immune from the law by dint of his noble status, things didn t look up much for the prince after that: married again, he became subject to fits of depression that could only be relieved by regular beatings from a group of young boys kept at his castle for this express purpose. Embroiled in both the Spanish Inquisition and a witchcraft trial (he was supposedly tormented by the spells and potions of his rejected former concubine), Gesualdo ended his days in a depressive tumult and is said to have been beaten to death, aged 47, by his servants in some kind of masochistic rampage.

        "content": "But why would the studio heads, most of whom were Jewish, so willingly agree to shape their movies to please Nazi sensibilities? Urwand suggests it was all about maintaining access to the German market. Urwand s critics claim he has got it wrong   that the German market wasn t consistently lucrative in the 1930s. On this point, Urwand concedes that box office revenues really started to dwindle by about 1936   and that in 1937 one US studio sustained a loss in Germany. But he maintains Hollywood was thinking in the long term   it wanted to maintain a business relationship to ensure it had access to markets in Germany and other European countries that Hitler might conquer should the Third Reich prevail. Some of Urwand s detractors also maintain he has overplayed the role and influence of the German consul in Hollywood. Steven J Ross, Professor of History at USC, who is working on a book called Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews and their Spies Foiled Nazi and Fascist Plots Against America, argues that it wasn t George Gyslling who had the power but local American officials enforcing the Motion Picture Production Code. The Production Code was a set of self-imposed guidelines that Hollywood adopted. Its stipulations governed how filmmakers could cover a wide range of subjects   everything from sex, drugs and murder to the depiction of American flag. Ross notes that it also  prohibited any studio from making a film that denigrated any foreign country or leader. So that meant that most of the efforts to produce anti-fascist films didn t get produced not because of Gyssling but because of the Production Code censors simply refusing to allow it to be made because it violated the code.  Also, it s argued that there are other reasons why the studio heads didn t fight more strongly to make films with anti-fascist themes   or for the inclusion of Jewish characters in their movies. Film critic David Denby says that  the studio bosses were all from Eastern Europe. They never lost their feeling that as outsiders and as Jews, it could all be taken away.  Consequently they may have been hesitant, in an anti-Semitic environment, of taking any action which could be construed as being favourable to Jewish interests. LA influential",

Adolf Hitler, a failed artist with deeply conservative tastes, waged a propaganda battle against modernist art which foreshadowed his total war against the rest of Europe. The Bauhaus, with its clean lines and community aesthetic, was described as  the crucible of modernism . It epitomised what Hitler viewed as an evil threat. Hitler was particularly fond of architecture. He became obsessed with the idea of rebuilding Berlin as the new capital of Europe and remodelling his 'home town' of Linz, even as he hid in his bunker in 1945.

Concorde flew for the last time ten years ago. This supremely elegant airliner has yet to be replaced and, in an age of ubiquitous flying buses, cheap flights and long-term recession, perhaps it never will be. Glamorous and exclusive, a technological marvel and a thing of daunting beauty, Concorde belonged to an era that has vanished in a cloud of burned kerosene.

Through the aircraft s small windows, passengers could see dark blue space above them and the curvature of the Earth below. At 60,000-ft, they cruised twice the height of Jumbo jets, faster than a bullet and faster than the speed (1,070mph at the Equator) the Earth rotates. A time machine of sorts, Concorde flew so very fast across the Atlantic that its passengers landed   according to their watches   before they had taken off. The pencil-thin aircraft generated so much heat in the process that its fuselage stretched by up to twelve inches in flight. Of course, there was a price to pay for this aerial Grand Prix.

        "content": "Fifty years since the Rolling Stones released their first single, Greg Kot asks whether the band s music has suffered from comparison with The Beatles. By the time the Rolling Stones got around to making records in 1963, The Beatles had already been cutting tracks with George Martin at Abbey Road studios for nearly a year. The Beatles were already stars, and their sweep made what the Stones did (and every other band in the UK, for that matter) seem like a response. In the end, of course, the Stones got their due as rock s nastiest band   that is, until Johnny Rotten came along. Since then, history has pretty much confined the two legendary groups to their prescribed roles: The Beatles as innovators and universal pop icons, the Stones as the anti-Beatles, the dirtiest Chicago blues band not from Chicago. Myth becomes fact. Or does it? It s hard to imagine that a band currently charging as much as $600 for their North American concert tour could once have been underrated. But the Stones  musical contributions often get short shrift because of the huge shadow cast by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and, yes, even Ringo Starr. On the occasion of the 50-year anniversary of the Rolling Stones  first single   a cover of Chuck Berry s Come On, released in June 1963   it s time to reassess. Were the Stones as revolutionary as the Beatles? No, but their reign of good-to-great albums was nearly twice as long, and their best music from this era   1963 through 1981   has a consistency, durability and variety that few bands from any era could match. Not even The Beatles, it turns out. The Beatles were running on fumes during the Let it Be sessions in 1969 and broke up soon after piecing together their final masterpiece, Abbey Road. The Stones were already playing it prickly on their first single. Come On was loosely modelled on Berry s original, recorded in 1960 at Chess Records studio in Chicago, but it had nothing of the guitarist s bounce and brightness. Berry raced through the lyrics with breathless anxiety, but the Stones played it rough and sullen as Mick Jagger sneered his way through the obstacles life dared to throw at him. The track rippled onto the pop charts. A few months later the Stones would have an even bigger hit with another cover, I Wanna Be Your Man, written by two guys named Lennon and McCartney, who were already so popular in the UK that they could hand leftovers to their rivals and watch them turn into gold. The British invasion The Beatles invaded and seduced America, with their three-night run on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964. For the next six years they were the biggest rock band in the world. The Stones followed The Beatles overseas a few months later, but were smugly mocked by Dean Martin on a less popular TV variety show, Hollywood Palace.",

        "content": "To celebrate 100 years since the composer s birth, Clemency Burton-Hill recommends the best way for a casual listener to discover the magic of Britten s music. 2013 has brought forth an embarrassment of riches when it comes to musical anniversaries. As well as the bicentenaries of Wagner and Verdi, the year marks four centuries since the musical visionary and murderer Gesualdo died and one since the marvel that is Benjamin Britten was born. Britten s musical language is singular and can be tough going, and his sound world can be as disconcerting and strange as it is ravishing. Where in Britten s output might a casual listener begin? For me, the master keys that unlocked Britten s universe were his Canticles. A listen to the complete cycle will take less than a single hour of your life but resonate far beyond. Composed between 1947 and 1974, they bookend Britten s post-war career and form a unique strand in his oeuvre.  They are song, opera, cantata and chamber music , says the tenor Ben Johnson, a rising British (and Britten) star, whose critically-acclaimed new recording of the Canticles is out now on Signum Classics.  And so they correspond with the most delicate of intimacy and the most effective of grand gesture . There can be  no greater summary , he reckons, of Britten s work. Like a prayer Suffused with spirituality if not overtly liturgical ( canticle , loosely defined, denotes a short prayer-like song), they are five precise distillations of Britten s art: gem-like compressions of his supreme talents as a dramatist of human emotion. Musically spare and occasionally subversive, the Canticles shimmer with dissonance and drama, love and chaos. They seethe, they teem, they shatter. They are not, Johnson cautions,  easy listening . But much of the engagement and the wonder   especially for a bookish listener   comes from Britten s ability to set text with such mastery. As a new exhibition at the British Library explores, Britten always had a splendidly literary intelligence, writing operas based on Thomas Mann (Death in Venice), Shakespeare (A Midsummer Night s Dream), Henry James (The Turn of the Screw) and Herman Melville (Billy Budd). The words of the Canticles drink wide and deep across English literature, from the Bible to 17th-Century metaphysical poetry; from medieval Chester Miracle Plays to Edith Sitwell, whose Still Falls The Rain is the basis for the mournful Canticle III   composed in memory of the young pianist Noel Mewton-Wood, who had recently killed himself.",

        "content": "It is no longer the world s tallest building, but the Empire State Building s charisma ensures it remains an icon of American design.  Look! There s the Empire State Building!  First-time visitors to New York have been pointing excitedly to the pencil thin profile of the Empire State Building for more than eighty years. Lit up by night in coats of many electric colours celebrating high days and holidays, its spire sometimes vanishing into low cloud, at others crackling with lightning, this commanding and supremely elegant skyscraper is, beyond doubt, one of the world s most revered buildings. In some ways this is surprising. To bring the 1,454-ft (443 m) skyscraper down to earth, the Empire State Building is nothing more than an office block, and for several decades many of its 102 floors were rather shabby. It got off to a less than auspicious start. Declared open by President Herbert Hoover on 1 May 1931, the  tallest building in the world  was hit by the Great Depression. A year on, just a quarter of its floors had been occupied; and it took until 1950 before what New Yorkers dubbed the  Empty State Building  turned a profit. Worse still, on 28 July 1945 a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber flying through fog smashed into the offices of the National Catholic Welfare Council housed on the 79th and 80th floors, killing fourteen people. Today, the Empire State Building   home to some 1,000 businesses   is profitable and, enjoying a major renovation, becoming cleaner and  greener  than it has ever been. Clad in Indiana limestone, this slim steel-framed 20th Century ziggurat rockets up from the site of the old Waldorf Astoria Hotel. This was bought by a consortium led by John J Raskob, a high-rolling New York financier   a papal knight and father of thirteen children   who worked for General Motors. In 1929, GM s principal rival, Chrysler, had just put the finishing touches to the svelte 1,046-ft (319m) Art Deco skyscraper that bore its name in central Manhattan. Empire building Through Raskob s towering ambition, GM would go one better than Walter Chrysler. Raskob is said to have asked his architect, Brooklyn-born William Lamb of Shreve Lamb and Harmon,  Bill, how high can you make it so it won t fall down?  The answer was, of course, higher than the Chrysler Building. Drawing on the design of his earlier 314-ft (96m) Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Lamb prepared his design drawings in a fortnight.",

        "content": "A new book, Rocking the Wall, claims that that concert, and in particular a short speech which Springsteen gave in German from the stage, galvanised attitudes. As the author, Erik Kirschbaum, tells the BBC:  Three-hundred-thousand East Germans were there   young, enthusiastic East Germans who had never had the chance to see a big Western rock star like that. Chimes of freedom?  Springsteen played an amazing concert   four hours long. It went straight to their hearts.  But what added the political impetus was that in the middle of it, Springsteen defied the authorities and gave a speech no more than a paragraph long. He spoke in German, which he had written out phonetically:  I am not for or against a government. I ve come to play rock and roll for you, in the hope that one day all barriers will be torn down.  He was greeted with a roar of approval. The moment he had spoken, he took off into Chimes of Freedom:  Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake/ Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsaked/ Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake/ An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing . The concert was transmitted with a time delay on East German television and radio channels and the short but utterly powerful speech never made it to air   but those in the concert knew exactly what  barriers  meant, and their word of mouth later travelled the nation. Of course, those words did not cause the collapse of communism. If they had not been spoken, East Germany s communist regime would still have crashed. The forces of change were too strong. But those forces didn t move on their own. Some factors pushed them further and some held them back. Some fanned the flame   and Springsteen gets credit for that, according to Erik Kirschbaum:  They had never heard a message like that. Here was this big, famous American rock star who came into the middle of East Germany, into East Berlin, and told them he hoped that the wall would come down one day.",

        "content": "A groundbreaking vision and a controversial construction colour the fascinating history of one of the world s most iconic buildings, writes Jonathan Glancey.  It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.  With this ringing endorsement from Unesco in 2007, the Sydney Opera House was declared a World Heritage Site. The famous building, with its soaring, sail-like roofs, that is often said to define the city, country and continent, was promoted to join ranks with the Egyptian pyramids, the Great Wall of China and the cathedrals of Chartres and Durham. This must have been a deeply moving moment for Jorn Utzon (1918-2008), the brilliant and poetic architect of the Sydney Opera House. From now on, there could be no doubting the supremely special qualities of this astonishing yet once hugely controversial building, opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1973. Today, few of the 1.2 million people who buy tickets for performances each year, and many fewer perhaps of the seven million who come to Sydney s Bennelong Point from around the world to gawp at this architectural marvel, would ever think that its visionary architect was once treated like a pariah by the government that commissioned the building. The story is as dismal, and as necessary to recall, as the opera house is glorious. It had all begun happily enough when, in 1957, Utzon s proposal was chosen from the 233 entries in an international competition held by the government of New South Wales for the design of an opera house on the site of a tram depot fronting Sydney Harbour. The judges kept returning to the young Danish architect s thrilling drawings even after they had discarded them several times in favour of more obviously practical designs. Intuition won the day.  We are convinced , said the judges at last,  that they [Utzon s drawings] present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.  Out of touch Construction began in 1957 with the driving of 588 concrete piles into land in and around Sydney Harbour to support the huge new building. But, as delays increased and costs began to spiral, a new coalition conservative government voted into office in 1965, took Utzon to task. Like Gaudi   the architect of Barcelona s Sagrada Familia   before him, Utzon believed that the design of a building on this scale should evolve over time. Davis Hughes, the new minister of public works, representing a government that was not exactly culturally aware, demanded instant solutions including a full set of working drawings of the interiors to speed construction along.",
