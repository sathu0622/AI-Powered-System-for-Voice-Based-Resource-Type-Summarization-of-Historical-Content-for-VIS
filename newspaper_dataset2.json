        "content": "Night-time treasure thieves threatening a nation's heritage 17 August 2025 Share Save Will Fyfe BBC News Share Save BBC Police found more than 50 holes had been dug among the graves overnight As darkness falls in one corner of Wales, police officers begin their hunt for treasure thieves - a crime that would sound like fantasy if it wasn't for the evidence. In Gwent Police's patch, the hills are littered with ancient forts and Roman remains - and have become a regular target for those hoping to unearth rare artefacts for the black market. Often, investigators are left with nothing but a hole in the ground - with little idea of what has been stolen or its value - though some looted treasures have been worth millions. Nighthawking, as it is nicknamed, is now seen as a genuine threat to the nation's heritage. Police have been using thermal imaging cameras attached to drones and binoculars capable of picking out suspected treasure thieves PC Dan Counsell had never heard of the term nighthawking before he took a call in September 2019. He was told locals of an ancient village near Chepstow had awoken to find more than 50 holes mysteriously dug among the gravestones of their churchyard. Residents were horrified and newspaper headlines spoke of \"grave robbers.\" PC Counsell understood the upset - many of his own family members, including grandparents, were buried there. In truth the robbers weren't interested in the dead, but the artefacts that may be buried beyond them, deep into the Earth. Before it became a Christian church about 700 years ago, there were Romans here. Ancient standing stones hidden in the woods of south Wales' hill forts have become targets for treasure thieves Among the holes, some dug on top of the graves themselves, were discarded bits of old metal - a telltale sign that those practising in the \"darker underbelly\" of metal detecting had been here. Known in the archaeological community as nighthawkers, they use the cover of darkness to access sites they have no legal right to disturb in the hope of unearthing treasure. Some do it for the thrill of building their own private collection, others are thought to smuggle items abroad in the hopes of selling them to the highest bidder. It's not uncommon for illicit finds to appear on online auction sites. Archaeologists and police point out this is a small number of people in an otherwise hugely respectful community of metal detectorists. British Museum These coins were from a stolen Viking hoard worth  3m - most of which has never been recovered In one of the most recent high-profile cases, two men from south Wales were found guilty of stealing a hoard of Viking gold from Herefordshire worth  3m - most of it has never been recovered. After PC Counsell's first case in the graveyard, he began looking out for the phenomenon. Within two years his team had uncovered 23 suspected incidents in the force's patch - a 600 sq mile (1,550 sq km) corner of south-east Wales peppered with imposing castles, ancient hill forts and Roman ruins. Police have been getting reports of people digging in fields at night Reports of people in fields at night and mysterious holes being discovered has all led PC Counsell's team to uncover cases of nighthawking. He said one of the most worrying things was that most targeted Scheduled Monuments - a term used in the UK to describe archaeological areas of great national importance. Cadw, the authority charged with protecting Wales' 4,000-plus protected ancient sites, said it saw 10 to 20 nighthawking incidents each year, but that the nature of it meant was very likely underreported. It often relies on an eagle-eyed member of the public spotting an unusual hole in the ground and deciding to report it to police, rather than discounting it as the work of a badger or rabbit. Police say nighthawking holes are distinctive and often feature clean cuts on three sides - sometimes with discarded metal laid out nearby. Dr Jonathan Berry, Cadw's senior inspector of ancient monuments and archaeology, said sometimes there were innocent explanations, like hobbyists not understanding the rules. Others, however, were motivated by \"greed\", with elements of organised crime. \"In terms of where these things go, that's kind of murky, but very often finds are sold on things like online auction houses, antiques centres, things like that,\" he said. \"It could also just be private networks, social media. You can find items of significant rarity and value can be out of the country and in other collections very quickly.\" The fields near the churchyard targeted by \"grave robbers\" have become a hotspot for activity According to police, often the sites targeted are remote, treacherous even, and reminiscent of an Indiana Jones expedition - minus the booby traps. One site PC Counsell takes us to, a series of standing stones, is through dense woodland, up a steep mountain track - even in a 4x4 with a trained police driver it's a hairy climb. To think treasure hunters could be making the journey in the pitch-black sounds fanciful and yet this site has fallen victim to nighthawking multiple times. \"Clearly their remoteness is attractive to potential criminals. They see these sites as being safe in terms of not being disturbed or apprehended.\" In an attempt to even the odds, the rural crime team has been using thermal imaging cameras attached to drones and binoculars capable of picking out suspected treasure thieves on a pitch-black mountain side. Recently, that helped them catch a suspected nighthawker hiding behind a pile of manure after his footprints on the fresh dung heap shone up on thermal imaging. \"It's a really hard crime to detect,\" said PC Counsell. \"Yet on at least six to eight occasions we've discovered people illegally metal detecting.\" Police have been using thermal imaging to spot any potential treasure thieves returning to the graveyard targeted in 2019 None of those caught so far have been the ones accessing Wales' legally protected ancient sites, but Gwent Police hopes the frequent night patrols and new technology will get results. \"The sadness around it all is that these are scheduled ancient monuments for a reason - because they are recognised as being of national historical importance,\" said PC Counsell. \"If something is removed that we are unaware of, it could be really important, we just don't know. \"Once that item is gone it's gone forever. It's having a big impact on the nation's heritage.\" A 17th Century silver thimble found in Flintshire was recently declared as treasure after being handed in by a metal detectorist When somebody finds something that could be treasure, they have a legal obligation to declare it. They are not allowed to keep it, but if they followed the rules and unearthed it from land they had permission to be on - then they will be paid a share of its value once it's bought by a museum. This sees experts such as Sian Iles, a curator at the National Museum of Wales, brought in to give their verdict on whether any potential item meets the threshold for treasure. There are several steps, but loosely speaking an item should be \"old and gold\". In Wales the general threshold is more than 300 years old and made up of at least 10% precious metal. \"Every treasure find helps us to build a picture about the decisions people in Wales were making in that time period, about their fashions or their beliefs,\" said Ms Iles. Sian Iles helps to assess whether an item should be considered as treasure",

        "content": "How a 'moth-eaten rag' became a war memorial 16 August 2025 Share Save Katy Prickett BBC News, Cambridgeshire Share Save The Long Shop The union jack is the centrepiece of a memorial made to remember the men of the 4th Battalion who died while prisoners of the Japanese A small coastal town is home to an unusual World War Two war memorial created by soldiers in memory of comrades who died while prisoners of war (POW). It was made by men from the 4th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment, who were captured at the fall of Singapore in 1942. They spent more than three years as slave labourers for the Japanese army, much of it at Chungkai camp in Thailand. The centrepiece of the memorial in Leiston, Suffolk, is a union jack, used in the camp during funeral services and brought home by Corp Hermie Bailey after he and the other survivors were finally liberated. In 1952, the veterans transformed the \"moth-eaten rag\" into a tribute to the POWs of the 4th Battalion who died and to mark the 10th anniversary of their capture. \"Sometimes people just refer to it as a flag, but it's not just a flag - the flag is just the centrepiece of a very, very interesting and unusual war memorial,\" said Taff Gillingham, chairman of the Friends of the Suffolk Regiment. Norfolk Museums Service Men from Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire regiments joined other prisoners of war and slave labour to toil on the Burma to Thailand railway In 1942, the 4th Battalion was among many Allied divisions rushed to defend Singapore, in the wake of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour. After fierce fighting but against impossible odds, the British, Australian and Indian forces were ordered to surrender. Somehow the 11ft by 6ft (3.3m by 1.8m) flag went with the men of the 4th Battalion when they were transferred to Chungkai camp, said Mr Gillingham. This was a POW camp used during the construction of the infamous Burma-Thailand Railway, and today it is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery. About 13,000 Allied prisoners of war died during the railway project, plus an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 civilians, according to the commission. Mr Gillingham said the 4th and 5th battalions of the Suffolk Regiment were about 2,000 strong when they disembarked at Singapore in 1942, but more than a third of them had died by the end of the war. The POWs were allowed to build a little wooden chapel at Chungkai for church services, where the flag rested on its altar. \"And every time one of the soldiers died, it was used for the funeral service,\" Mr Gillingham said. \"Starved, beaten and executed for the slightest misdemeanours - the thing that inspires me is their resilience and their ingenuity, making medicines from plants that they'd find in the jungle, for example.\" The Long Shop Every year on VJ Day (Victory over Japan), the people of Leiston remember the men from the town who never came back, said historian Taff Gillingham Every aspect of the memorial has a specific link to the 4th Battalion, a territorial unit which recruited from the Leiston area. Mr Gillingham said: \"The frame is just as interesting [as the flag], in that it's made from wood salvaged from Southwold Pier and the metal frame it sits on was made by the engineering works of Garretts, the engineering works in Leiston, so it was a proper local project. \"And the colours behind the flag mean something too - they are the colours of the Pacific Star, the medal that all the Far East prisoners of war were given.\" Today, it is owned by the Friends of the Suffolk Regiment and is on long-term loan to the town's Long Shop Museum. When the men of the 4th Battalion were liberated at the end of the war, many, including Corp Bailey, continued to serve in the territorials for years, with weekly training and annual camps. Underneath the memorial is a plaque which describes it as \"a moth-eaten rag on a worm-eaten pole\". It also records how the union jack was \"hoisted to the top of the pole in the camp by the men of the battalion who survived three years of living hell\". Mr Gillingham said: \"It's often said to be the only war memorial based on an artefact brought back from the field, and it's certainly the only one I can think of, but it's a lovely thing because it has a direct connection with the place, and the people, with those who died.\" A service to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day and the end of World War Two will be held at the memorial at 10:30 BST.",

When Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with US President Donald Trump in Anchorage today, it will mark the first time a Russian leader has ever set foot in Alaska, despite the fact that the US's largest state was actually a Russian colony from 1799 to 1867. The summit, billed as a conversation about ending the war in Ukraine, comes more than 150 years after the US purchased the nearly 600,000sq-mile expanse from Tsarist Russia for just $7.2m (less than two cents an acre), and serves as a reminder that the two nations are far closer than most imagine. Though the US and Russia are often cast as distant rivals, their histories and geographies are deeply intertwined in America's 49th state. In the early 18th Century, the frigid waters of the Bering Strait, just 51 miles wide at its narrowest point, served as a thoroughfare for Siberian traders, Russian Orthodox missionaries and Indigenous I upiat and Yupik communities who moved freely between the two continents to trade, marry and hunt.",

But this rare boxwood flute hasn't been played in almost 200 years. The last person to do so was likely its owner, James Glencairn Burns, son of Robert Burns, a talented musician and a passionate advocate for his father's legacy. But thanks to a grant from the Pilgrim Trust and the Association of Independent Museums, the flute has been restored and is helping raise money for the wider restoration of Ellisland Museum and Farm near Dumfries. The flute was stored in a family home and exposed to the peat and timber which was burned in the fire, so it needed to be cleaned Ellisland was the home Burns built for his family, and where he composed over 130 poems and songs including Auld Lang Syne. \"It's the only instrument that we have in our collection, \" says Joan McAlpine, director of the campaign to preserve the Ellisland site. \"It's a boxwood flute dating from the very early 19th century and we know it belonged to his son who was an accomplished flautist and often performed his father's songs.\" \"So as part of the restoration we took a decision that we wanted it to be restored to a playable condition so that the music that Burns created at Ellisland and passed down to his son could be passed to audiences worldwide who we hope will help us save Ellisland.\" Joan McAlpine, director of the campaign to preserve the Ellisland site, said the flute was played by Burns' son - an accomplished flautist Restoration began two years ago first by Edinburgh-based conservator Lydia Messerschmidt of Phoenix Conservation, then by early flute expert Robert Biglio in london. Adam Dickson, curator at the Robert Burns Ellisland Trust said the restoration was complicated because the flute had been stored in the living room of a family home, which had still been in use until 2019. \"The previous curator lived in the house, as well as looking after the museum. It was exposed to the peat and timber which was burned in the fire so it needed to be thoroughly cleaned up.\" Flautist Claire Mann had the task of gently reawakening the instrument by playing it for short bursts of time in the \"Spence\", the room in Ellisland in which it had been stored, and where Burns composed many of his songs between 1788 and 1791. Adam Dickson, curator at the Robert Burns Ellisland Trust said the restoration was complicated And then came the moment of truth when the flute was played for the first time in 150 years at a private performance in Edinburgh. Along with vocalist Robyn Stapleton and harpist Wendy Stewart, she played a number of Burns works from the Ellisland songbook including Auld Lang Syne, Ye Banks and Braes, and John Anderson, My Jo, all written at the farm which Burns described as \"sweet poetic ground\". \"I mean, with any old instrument you think to yourself, who played this and what kind of music did they play?\" says Claire. \"So for it to be associated with Burns and his family is really special. Maybe he played the melody of old Lang Syne on the flute so I guess to play an instrument in his footsteps is very special.\" Claire Mann is the only musician allowed to play the priceless historic instrument",

The team from the University of Southampton said it was the first time one from this period had been totally uncovered in the UK. Buckler's Hard, the small hamlet in the New Forest where the slipway is located, was once home to one of the busiest private shipyards of the 1700s. The researchers said they hoped the findings would help improve their understanding of shipbuilding techniques and infrastructure during the period. The slipway is the first of its era to be fully revealed in the UK The dig was supported by the newly formed Buckler's Hard Shipyard Trust, a conservation charity. A total of 55 wooden warships were built at Buckler's Hard for the Royal Navy in the 1700s, some of which were comparable in size to HMS Victory. \"No other private yard built as many ships for the navy during this period,\" said Prof Jon Adams, director of the university's Centre for Maritime Archaeology. Prof Jon Adams said Buckler's Hard provided a unique look into the shipbuilding techniques and infrastructure of the time Unlike the slipway at Buckler's Hard, most slipways from the 18th Century are now buried under concrete. Prof Adams said that made this one uniquely suited for learning about traditional shipbuilding. \"The only opportunity is a place like this where you can actually see the whole of the whole of the infrastructure and the logistical structures needed to build ships of that size,\" he said. The team also found some historical curiosities, such as musket balls and fastening nails from the 1700s",

The chain reaction caused multiple power plants covering an area as far west as Cleveland and Detroit and as far north as Toronto and Ottawa to shut down. Within minutes, more than 50 million people found themselves without electricity. New York, the largest city in the US, was just one of the many places where everyday life was brought to a sudden standstill on 14 August 2003, 22 years ago this week. \"The blackout began just before yesterday evening's rush hour, bringing chaos to the traffic-clogged streets,\" reported BBC correspondent Nick Bryant. \"Members of the public were forced to deputise as makeshift cops.

The disruption to New York was widespread and chaotic. It would take emergency services hours to evacuate passengers from around 600 subway and commuter rail cars that were stranded between stations.

Official documents at 14th Century St Andrew's Church in Alfriston record the stone artwork to be a dog biting its tail, but the curled up creature has sparked debate for many years. The carving's true meaning has remained uncertain for some time, adding to the church's rich tapestry of folklore and mystery. But Kevin Gordon, a local historian, says he is now convinced it is a \"medieval Christian symbol representing self-sacrifice and chastity\", depicting a beaver biting off its own testicles. The carving is to the left of the altar in the medieval church, close to another believed to represent Lewinna, the only female saint from Sussex. Mr Gordon said: \"I was showing a group around and a woman said to me 'that's not a dog, it's a beaver biting its testicles off'. \"She explained to me that in Christian art a beaver represents self-sacrifice and chastity.\" He added: \"In medieval times people used to catch the beaver for the medicine that was inside its testicles. \"People believed that if a beaver thought it was going to get caught it would bite its testicles off to escape. \"I think that's a far better explanation of this creature than Saint Lewinna's dog. \"I have found plenty of references in medieval manuscripts which show beavers in exactly the same style as the one depicted at Alfriston.\" Simon Furber/BBC The carving lies within the 14th Century church In 2024, Mr Gordon persuaded one of the top beaver experts in the country, Derek Gow, to visit the church. \"He looked at the figure and confirmed it was in fact a beaver and not a dog.\" The medieval church draws in tourists from all over the world. Mr Gordon believes it is important that people know the truth about its contents. \"People coming into the church should be informed about what it is they are seeing. \"Dogs may be a faithful companion to people, but in Christian art it's the beaver which represents Christian values.\" The curious case of the Alfriston beaver Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

University of Reading students and staff have been taking part in an annual dig at the site in Cookham, Berkshire, and a neighbouring cemetery. The team first discovered the Anglo-Saxon site in Cookham, Berkshire, in 2021. Thomas Hayes, director of the university's field school, said this year they had found evidence of illness and treatment in human remains, including bedsores, suggesting palliative care may have taken place. Thalia Argrave said the dig was a \"valuable\" experience \"It feels like I'm doing something really important,\" said first year undergraduate student Thalia Argrave. \"It's just the constant reminder that these were people, they were living their lives just as we're currently living our lives, and we're finding out about them and rediscovering them now. I'm really happy to be a part of [it].\" Thomas Hayes said archaeologists had found evidence of end-of-life care Mr Hayes said the archaeologists had found \"a lot more in the way of human remains\", particularly \"a number of juvenile remains\". The evidence of those in the monastery caring for the sick, he said, was \"really important\". \"At the time, care for the soul and care for the body were treated almost as the same - equal importance. \"But it's also showing the execution of this religious duty in the actual practice of this monastery. \"We don't always see that in the archaeological record but here we're seeing it very actively in the population that we're finding.\" Ms Argrave said the team spent a year preparing for the dig, adding: \"It's really valuable and important to be part of that first hand. \"There are experts everywhere in the trenches so we're asking lots of questions and learning so much.\" The skeletons unearthed \"tell their own stories\", said student Eleanor Rawlings Eleanor Rawlings, another first year student, said taking part in the dig made her appreciate how much effort is involved. \"I have so much more appreciation for the work that goes into what they put in the museums, because this takes so long to slowly inch away all the soil and to get such a good clear outline,\" she said. \"I'm loving it.\" The excavated skeletons \"tell their own stories\", she added. \"The bones themselves can tell you so much more about what a person's life would have looked like in that time.\" The monastery site has been excavated by Reading university staff and students every summer since 2021 Mr Hayes said it was interesting to see the students get involved. \"Some of the students, who had no expectations and didn't know what to expect from this, are really taking to it and really enjoying it. \"This year, we've got a fantastic group of students who are just getting stuck in and asking loads of really interesting questions and really engaging with the subject.\" You can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, , or Instagram.",

The artefacts, which were found in the north Cotswolds in 2023, are now on show at the Corinium Museum in Cirencester. After being discovered by amateur metal detectorist Glenn Manning, the swords were X-rayed using funding from Historic England, which revealed they were created nearly two millennia ago. Emma Stuart, director of the Museum, said: \"I'd like to thank all of our funders and conservators for ensuring the swords are preserved and displayed for our visitors and for future generations to enjoy.\" Glen Manning The swords hit headlines when they were discovered in 2023 \"The team are all excited to see the new display and welcome people into the museum to see these rare pieces of Roman military equipment that are now part of our archaeological collections,\" she added. The swords will be displayed in two specially-designed glass cases alongside a copper alloy bowl which was discovered during the same dig. Peter Hughes, chair of Friends of Corinium Museum, said he was \"confident\" the swords and the bowl would be a \"major attraction\" for visitors to the museum. Upon examination the swords were believed to be cavalry weapons or weapons intended to be used on horseback, and were likely to be in use by the 160s, through the later Second Century and far into the Third Century AD. Councillor Paul Hodgkinson, who oversees health, culture and visitor experience at Cotswold District Council said: \"These swords connect us directly to our Roman past and remind us of the rich history beneath our feet here in the Cotswolds. \"The Corinium Museum continues to lead the way in bringing our heritage to life, and this display is a testament to the dedication of everyone involved.\"",

The discovery was made by the University of Oxford's chemistry department, who reinvestigated jars excavated from a 6th Century BE Greek shrine in Paestum, southern Italy. In a study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, researchers said biomolecular evidence showed the residue was likely in the form of honeycomb. The bronze jars were originally found in an underground shrine, an hour and a half's drive away from Pompeii, in 1954. They contained an orange-brown sticky substance archaeologists assumed was honey, as it was often left as an offering to gods or buried alongside the dead. Dr Luciana da Costa Carvalho, project co-lead, said: \"This research is a reminder that archaeological collections hold untapped scientific potential and how new information can be revealed when modern analytical techniques and multidisciplinary collaborations are combined.\" Adobe Stock The jars were found in an underground shrine in southern Italy in 1954 For 30 years, three different teams analysed the residue, but failed to confirm the presence of honey and said it was some sort of animal or vegetable fat contaminated with pollen and insect parts. Now, chemists have used modern techniques to examine the contents of the bronze jar, through a partnership with the University of Oxford's Ashmolean Museum and the Archaeological Park of Pompeii. Thomas Player Dr Luciana da Costa Carvalho said the discovery was a reminder of the scientific potential in archaeological collections Professor James McCullagh, director of Oxford's mass spectrometry research facility in the department of chemistry, co-led the project. He said the number of analytical techniques used for the study were \"key to the success of this study\". \"By applying several mass spectrometry and spectroscopic approaches we were able to reveal a comprehensive picture of the residue's molecular composition   enabling us to distinguish between contaminants, degradation products, and original biomarkers,\" he said. A university statement added that the authors of the study now hoped their work would inspire further re-analysis of legacy materials, including those held in museum collections.

        "content": "Ancient site stirs heated political debate on India's past 27 July 2025 Share Save Cherylann Mollan BBC News, Keeladi, Tamil Nadu Share Save ASI A view of an excavated site in Keeladi where archaeologists have found evidence of industrial activity The Keeladi village in India's southern Tamil Nadu state has unearthed archeological finds that have sparked a political and historical battle. Amid coconut groves, a series of 15ft (4.5m) deep trenches reveal ancient artefacts buried in layers of soil - fragments of terracotta pots, and traces of long-lost brick structures. Experts from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology estimate the artefacts to be 2,000 to 2,500 years old, with the oldest dating back to around 580 BCE. They say these findings challenge and reshape existing narratives about early civilisation in the Indian subcontinent. With politicians, historians, and epigraphists weighing in, Keeladi has moved beyond archaeology, becoming a symbol of state pride and identity amid competing historical narratives. Yet history enthusiasts say it remains one of modern India's most compelling and accessible discoveries - offering a rare opportunity to deepen our understanding of a shared past. Keeladi, a village 12km (7 miles) from Madurai on the banks of the Vaigai river, was one of 100 sites shortlisted for excavation by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) archaeologist Amarnath Ramakrishnan in 2013. He selected a 100-acre site there because of its proximity to ancient Madurai and the earlier discovery of red-and-black pottery ware by a schoolteacher in 1975. Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology Burial urns near Keeladi, containing human skeletons and goods such as food and pots Since 2014, 10 excavation rounds at Keeladi have uncovered over 15,000 artefacts - burial urns, coins, beads, terracotta pipes and more - from just four of the 100 marked acres. Many are now displayed in a nearby museum. Ajay Kumar, leading the state archaeology team at Keeladi, says the key finds are elaborate brick structures and water systems - evidence of a 2,500-year-old urban settlement. \"This was a literate, urban society where people had separate spaces for habitation, burial practices and industrial work,\" Mr Kumar says, noting it's the first large, well-defined ancient urban settlement found in southern India. Since the Indus Valley Civilisation's discovery in the early 1900s, most efforts to trace civilisation's origins in the subcontinent have focused on northern and central India. So, the Keeladi finds have sparked excitement across Tamil Nadu and beyond. William Daniel, a teacher from neighbouring Kerala, said the discoveries made him feel proud about his heritage. \"It gives people from the south [of India] something to feel proud about, that our civilisation is just as ancient and important as the one in the north [of India],\" he says. Red and black pottery excavated from the site, displayed at the Keeladi Museum The politics surrounding Keeladi reflects a deep-rooted north-south divide - underscoring how understanding the present requires grappling with the past. India's first major civilisation - the Indus Valley - emerged in the north and central regions between 3300 and 1300 BCE. After its decline, a second urban phase, the Vedic period, rose in the Gangetic plains, lasting until the 6th Century BCE. This phase saw major cities, powerful kingdoms and the rise of Vedic culture - a foundation for Hinduism. As a result, urbanisation in ancient India is often viewed as a northern phenomenon, with a dominant narrative that the northern Aryans \"civilised\" the Dravidian south. This is especially evident in the mainstream understanding of the spread of literacy. It is believed that the Ashokan Brahmi script - found on Mauryan king Ashoka's rock edicts in northern and central India, dating back to the 3rd Century BCE - is the predecessor of most scripts in South and Southeast Asia. Epigraphists like Iravatham Mahadevan and Y Subbarayalu have long held the view that the Tamil Brahmi script - the Tamil language spoken in Tamil Nadu and written in the Brahmi script - was an offshoot of the Ashokan Brahmi script. But now, archaeologists from the Tamil Nadu state department say that the excavations at Keeladi are challenging this narrative. \"We have found graffiti in the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 6th Century BCE, which shows that it is older than the Ashokan Brahmi script. We believe that both scripts developed independently and, perhaps, emerged from the Indus Valley script,\" Mr Kumar says. Keeladi Museum Archaeologists say some graffiti found in Keeladi resembles that of the Indus Valley Epigraphist S Rajavelu, former professor of marine archaeology at the Tamil University, agrees with Mr Kumar and says other excavation sites in the state too have unearthed graffiti in the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 5th and 4th Century BCE. But some experts say that more research and evidence are needed to conclusively prove the antiquity of the Tamil Brahmi script. Another claim by the state department of archaeology that has ruffled feathers is that the graffiti found on artefacts in Keeladi is similar to that found in the Indus Valley sites. \"People from the Indus Valley may have migrated to the south, leading to a period of urbanisation taking place in Keeladi at the same time it was taking place in the Gangetic plains,\" Mr Kumar says, adding that further excavations are needed to fully grasp the settlement's scale. But Ajit Kumar, a professor of archaeology at Nalanda University in Bihar, says that this wouldn't have been possible. \"Considering the rudimentary state of travel back then, people from the Indus Valley would not have been able to migrate to the south in such large numbers to set up civilisation,\" he says. He believes the finds in Keeladi can be likened to a small \"settlement\". Keeladi Museum Pipes made of terracota were used to transport water While archaeologists debate the findings, politicians are already drawing links between Keeladi and the Indus Valley - some even claim the two existed at the same time or that the Indus Valley was part of an early southern Indian, or Dravidian, civilisation. The controversy over ASI archaeologist Mr Ramakrishnan's transfer - who led the Keeladi excavations - has intensified the site's political tensions. In 2017, after two excavation rounds, the ASI transferred Mr Ramakrishnan, citing protocol. The Tamil Nadu government accused the federal agency of deliberately hindering the digs to undermine Tamil pride. The ASI's request in 2023 for Mr Ramakrishnan to revise his Keeladi report - citing a lack of scientific rigour - has intensified the controversy. He refused, insisting his findings followed standard archaeological methods. In June, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin called the federal government's refusal to publish Mr Ramakrishnan's report an \"onslaught on Tamil culture and pride\". State minister Thangam Thennarasu accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led federal government of deliberately suppressing information to erase Tamilian history. India's Culture Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has now clarified that Mr Ramakrishnan's report has not been rejected by the ASI but is \"under review,\" with expert feedback yet to be finalised.

Centuries later the story of his savage death has been kept alive by St Gregory's Church, Sudbury, Suffolk, where his mummified head is on display. But how did the skull of the high-profile cleric end up in a small, covered cubbyhole in a church vestry 67 miles away from Tower Hill in London, where it was severed? Who was Simon Sudbury? Simon Theobald, as he was originally known, was born in Sudbury in and around 1316 before going on to study at the University of Paris. He became a chaplain under Pope Innocent VI in 1352, before taking on roles including the Chancellor of Salisbury and the Bishop of London and served King Edward III. Sudbury became the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1375 and Lord Chancellor of England in 1380   two significant roles he would fulfil until his death. Why was he killed? Sudbury was murdered during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, when he was ambushed at the Tower of London and beheaded by rebels unhappy with his role in introducing the third poll tax. Along with the Lord High Treasurer, Sir Robert Hales, Sudbury was dragged to the chopping block by one of the revolt's leaders, Johanna Ferrour, after guards granted the peasants access to the building. After being killed, his severed head was impaled onto a pole and placed on London Bridge for the public to see. Sudbury's body was taken to Canterbury Cathedral where it remains to this day. George King/BBC The former Archbishop of Canterbury helped build part of St Gregory's Church in Sudbury After six days of being on display in London, Sudbury's decapitated head was removed by the Lord Mayor of London, William Walworth. It was taken to his birthplace of Sudbury and reportedly identified by his brother, John of Chertsey, with whom he had founded a college in the town. The head was given to St Gregory's Church, which Sudbury had helped partly rebuild. Today it is positioned behind a clear screen and a wooden flap in the wall. The Reverend Andrew Doarks told the BBC he got quite the surprise when he took on the church three years ago. \"It wasn't something that was on the job description and it's not something that comes up on the parish profile as it is known,\" he said. \"It's something you don't get at theological college... how to manage severed heads. \"I sometimes lose sleep and think, 'What if somebody was to run away with him?'\" George King/BBC Mandy Turner told the BBC she finds Simon of Sudbury's skull \"quite friendly\" Mandy Turner, the treasurer at the church, said: \"[Simon's head] is nicely hidden away and not obvious to anyone who walks by. \"We have been very lucky that we haven't had to do anything to it since it was put into the cubby in the wall   it has not deteriorated at all and is very well mummified. \"In fact, we had some mobile dentists working here and they were looking at the teeth and saying he is not bad for his age.\" Simon of Sudbury's skull is on display to the public by appointment only. \"We get many visitors that come here to see the head, but others are taken by surprise, and they are not sure if they want to see the head or not,\" added Ms Turner. \"Some come because they believe they have a relationship with the Theobald family and others come just out of fascination. \"There's local people here who have never quite plucked up the courage to come and see it. But it is quite worth seeing and I actually find him quite friendly.\" Has the head ever been removed from the wall? George King/BBC Visitors flock from far and wide to view Sudbury's decapitated head at the church The only time the skull has been removed from the wall was in 2011, when it was taken to West Suffolk Hospital for a CT scan so a lifelike bronze bust of Sudbury could be made. Anthropologist Caroline Wilkinson, who oversaw the project, said at the time: \"The unusual thing was seeing the head in the hole in the wall in the church. \"I was expecting the bone to be a little bit more fragile, maybe a little bit crumbly, because this has been in the wall of a church for 600 years, but actually the bone is very sturdy. \"It doesn't look as if there's been too much damage.\" Mr Doarks said: \"People call it a head because he has got a bit of vertebrate on the neck, an ear, and there are bits of skin still on him, so we call him Simon's head.\" George King/BBC Experts at West Suffolk Hospital carried out a scan of the skull so a lifelike bronze bust of Sudbury's head could be created The rest of Sudbury's body is buried in a tomb at Canterbury Cathedral, along with a cannon ball which is used in place of his head, as per a request in his will. According to Ms Turner, the cathedral has asked \"several times\" for the head but St Gregory's Church \"feel the head belongs\" there. \"To us he has become what he was, a man of Sudbury, and that's why we particularly want to keep the head here,\" she said. \"The rioters of the Peasants' Revolt brought him back here to his brother, and he has been here ever since, so we feel this is actually where he belongs.\" Canon Andrew Dodd, the canon treasurer at Canterbury Cathedral, does not believe reuniting the body at this stage would be possible. He said: \"It would be a very complicated thing to organise because the tomb is sealed and there is no intention of reopening the tomb at this stage. \"We're not quite sure why the head is [in Sudbury] and we have the body - it's a real mystery,\" he added.

The network of passages and giant caverns stretching for 10km (6 miles) was found near English Bicknor in the Forest of Dean. The first part of the cave system, Redhouse Lane Swallet, was originally found in the 1990s by Paul Taylor, a caver from Gloucester. Conservation officer and retired physicist Dr Tim Nichols, who was part of a new generation of explorers which discovered the wider network of caverns, said he did not realise the significance of what they had recently found until they saw it. \"The first time when we stepped into the new passage when there was just two of us - all of our dreams had come true,\" Dr Nichols said. Bartek Biela The first part of the cave system was originally found in the 1990s \"That exploratory urge to go and find where no person has ever been before is really special. \"With each trip it just kept getting better and better.\" He explained a strong draught in the boulder filled passage at the end of the original network of caves had inspired him to delve deeper. Through sheer determination his team of explorers successfully dug past the boulders in August last year. Bartek Biela A team of cavers dug into the new network and explored it in August last year \"You have to pinch yourself, it is a once in a lifetime [find]. \"Every trip's just been like another birthday present and every trip we've been finding something different.\" \"Caves remain one of those things on the planet that are largely undiscovered. \"True genuine exploration - that's what's exciting about it,\" Dr Nichols added. Dr Nichols went on to explain how \"it's the biggest find\" in the UK in a long time. The last discovery was made in 2010 in what is now the UK's longest cave system called The Three Counties, which was initially thought to be three separate systems. Bartek Biela The network of 10 km of passages with giant caverns is in English Bicknor But in 2010, cavers discovered they were in fact interconnected making it 87km (54 miles) long. In the 1990s, Mr Taylor began exploration work on the Redhouse Lane Swallet in the Forest of Dean and after two years of digging discovered the initial cave system which was around a mile long. Mr Taylor said he is \"extremely honoured and proud\" to be a part of this history-making discovery. \"I started caving when I was just 13 years old and I'm 71 years old now,\" he said. \"To be the very first person to shine your light down that passage and put your footprints down - it's an amazing experience,\" Mr Taylor added.",

Surrounded by rocky hillocks, mango groves, small brick kilns and fields fed by a nearby canal, it exudes a languid, laid-back charm characteristic of rural South India. However, a 90-minute hike up one of the ridges flanking the village brought me to Moryar Gudda, or the \"Hill of the Dwarfs\", as its name means in the local Kannada language. Here, scattered across a granite-strewn plateau were nearly 1,000 prehistoric megalithic structures that have stood for more than 2,500 years. It's a startling sight: nearly as far as the eye can see, rows of giant stone chambers resembling houses and stone circles stretch across the landscape, forming one of the oldest and largest necropolises in India. The trek felt like stepping into a Tolkien tale. Massive boulders teetered precariously on top of one another, creating natural sculptures that seemed on the verge of tipping over at any moment but have somehow stood firm for millennia. Some formations housed rock shelters with red ochre paintings dating from 700-500 BCE, many still vivid with scenes of creatures resembling cattle and boar whose meanings have long been lost to time.

Built to commemorate royal milestones and loss, they tell a quiet story of love, grief and nation building. When Queen Victoria first visited Balmoral Castle in rural Aberdeenshire on 8 September 1848, six years after her first visit to Scotland, she took time out to appreciate the woodlands, gardens and rippling mountains. Perhaps she deeply breathed in the Caledonian pine air. Perhaps a deer stood motionless, caught in her gaze. Certainly, she saw a different future for herself and her husband, Prince Albert, on Deeside in the Highlands. \"All seemed to breathe freedom and peace, and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils,\" she recorded in her diary. Soon after, the baronial estate became a mainstay for the rest of her life   and it remains a sanctuary for the British Royal Family to this day. There are many stories hidden at Balmoral Castle, but perhaps none so intriguing as that of the estate's secret \"pyramids\", or memorial cairns. There are 11 of these, strewn almost negligently around the near-50,000-acre estate. The largest is a stone monolith more in keeping with the design of the great dynastic structures of Ancient Egypt than anything Scottish, while the smaller ones are scattered like clues to a greater mystery. And seeking them out   on a hunt akin to an Indiana Jones-type treasure hunt   is a little bit of everyday magic hidden among the Scots pine, firs and hemlocks. Like many visitors to the Royal Deeside, I'd been to the country's best-known estate before. Located in the eastern Cairngorm mountains, the turreted 167-room castle, ballroom, mews courtyard, sunken garden and thistle-shaped maze are a bonanza for visitors, especially between April and early August when the full grandeur of the castle is open to ticketed visitors.

The Somerset battle effectively ended Royalist control in the West Country, a key strategic region. This boosted Parliamentarian morale and crippled their opponents forces in one morning of fighting. Experts believe that the battle of July 1645, fought during the English Civil War, marked a turning point that ultimately led to the execution of King Charles I and the abolition of the monarchy. Historian Julian Humphrys, of the Battlefields Trust, said: \"This battle really was the beginning of the end for the Royalists.\" Julian Humphrys Historian Julian Humphrys said the Royalists were a \"bunch of boozers\" Lord Goring led the Royalists for King Charles I, while Sir Thomas Fairfax headed the Parliamentarian's New Model Army, known as the Roundheads, who were a skilled, disciplined force. Mr Humphrys said the Royalist army was different. \"They weren't the finest of troops you could say  a bunch of boozers really and their discipline was poor, they didn't have much money. \"They weren't being payed and they lived by nicking things off the local population who didn't like them in the slightest,\" he added. Lord Goring was holding an area about one mile east of Langport towards the village of Huish Episcopi. The Royalists wanted to buy time so their army could pull back to Bridgwater. They planted musket troops along the hedges, with a few guns to protect the ford crossing. It was then that the Parliamentarians came in with \"a bold attack\", said Mr Humphrys. They cleared the hedges of Royalists at what is now Picts Hill by sending musketeers down. This meant their cavalry could \"splash across the crossing and drive the Royalists back\". The Royalist troops did not put up much of a fight after the Roundheads crossed the water and were driven back quickly, he said. Mr Humphrys added that metal detectors are stilling unearthing musket balls and pistol shots from the action. Some local people who were being affected by the war armed themselves and were known as \"clubmen\". They would defend their area from the army pillaging their homes using things like cudgels and pitchforks. \"The reality for the people of the time was awful. It disrupted trade, the armies were never very healthy so they spread disease, they damaged buildings, they took people's food. By 1645, the people of Somerset were \"very fed up of the war\", Mr Humphrys added. Oliver Cromwell Mr Humphrys said Oliver Cromwell, the most famous Roundhead, detailed that he was actually there at the time, but \"he was more of a second-in-command\". \"He was a fairly minor east Anglian MP, but it was these victories which got him promoted gradually over time. \"This led to him eventually commanding the whole of Parliament's army,\" Mr Humphrys added. When it comes to commemorating the Civil War, Mr Humphrys said \"we need to remember these people were our ancestors\". \"Many of the ordinary soldiers had very little say of whether they fought or not and the cost of a civil war is a huge tragedy wherever it happens.\" \"A greater percentage of the population died from this civil war than in World War One,\" he said.

Black USAF: Cultural Connections in Cold War East Anglia is being led by Elma Glasgow from Cambridgeshire, who grew up alongside personnel on the border with Suffolk. Later in life she realised the stories of black men and women on these bases during the Cold war era had not been well documented and she was determined to give them a voice. Ms Glasgow wants to hear voices from Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and Essex for a new digital archive. Ms Glasgow explained she had always \"thought it was very normal\" to go into the American airbases and \"mingle with the Americans\" while growing up. She would also hear stories from relatives about their own experiences of interacting with the personnel. It was not until she left the area that she realised it was a \"pretty rare experience\". John Ferguson Elma Glasgow is leading the project and wants to hear stories from all aspects of life during the Cold War era Ms Glasgow has been recognised for her work on the Power of Stories exhibition that featured three original costumes from the Black Panther film. It was during this that she realised she could help bring stories to life. \"Telling different aspects of black history in the East of England is incredibly important because I think people have assumptions about the east - like it's all tractors and sugar beet,\" she continued. \"Actually we have an incredible cultural history and a lot of that was created by the Americans who were based here not just during the Cold War, but before that.\" John Ferguson The project has launched with the story of Geno Washington who was stationed in Suffolk in the 1960s The project launched with the story of Geno Washington, who was originally from Indiana and found himself at RAF Woodbridge in the early 1960s, before later becoming a successful soul singer. He said the Americans were welcomed into the area, and England and Ipswich were \"one of my first loves\". \"It was a great place to be because when I was in America they told us England is a luxury assignment out of all the places in Europe. I didn't know what to expect. \"When I got here it felt good.\" Ms Glasgow said Mr Washington had spoken to the team about how Ipswich was \"jumping at the time\" in its pubs and clubs. \"He was really surprised they could mingle with the local people because segregation was still very much in force within the air force as it was back in the USA,\" she said. \"There was a Jamaican joint, he said, and he would get on stage. \"He would lie to people so they would invite him up on stage - he said his auntie was Dinah Washington who at that time was really famous in England.\" The project wants to hear stories from all aspects of life - and people can fill out a contact form online.

The other has a few photos stuck in a bathroom. It's not hard to imagine which one the family of the time was keener to remember. However, as a musical celebrating the man in the bathroom makes clear, sometimes you have to play the long game - or as the show's title says, How to Win Against History. For the bathroom photos depict Henry Cyril Paget, 5th Marquess of Anglesey, a man who bankrupted his family and died young far from home, after a few short years of splashing his aristocratic forebears' cash on extravagant and outrageous self-produced shows in Edwardian Britain, appearing in women's dresses and costumes literally made of diamonds. Now 120 years after his death a play and the film Madfabulous, inspired by his life, is putting him firmly back in the spotlight, but what does the current generation of his family make of the man who was once relegated to a toilet? Alex, 8th Marquess of Anglesey, says Henry is now viewed with affection by himself and other family members, as time and changing attitudes have cast his exploits in a more understanding light. Although Henry married his cousin, their marriage was apparently never consummated and his wife later filed for annulment. Was he gay? No conclusive evidence either way, but it's hard not to imagine he was somewhere on the LGBTQ+ spectrum of sexualities. Marquess of Anglesey Alex, 8th Marquess of Anglesey, is happy to celebrate Henry Cyril's 'rather extraordinary and marvellous life' Alex says he first came to know of Henry through those bathroom photos. \"The one I particularly remember was him dressed up as Boadicea with big Edwardian moustaches. \"[It was] a bit of a giggle. His existence wasn't denied but he wasn't a major part of the family heritage. \"He was viewed as the black sheep of the family, this eccentric, weird bloke who we knew about and thought he sounded quite funny. \"When I was growing up in the 1950s and 60s, homosexuality was still illegal. He wasn't necessarily gay actually, he was probably asexual, but that whole kind of thing of an alternative sexuality was certainly not generally in most circles accepted. \"That personal sexual liberation of the 1960s, and then more recently of course with LGBTQ identities, he has become a bit of an icon, and attitudes towards him have definitely changed.\" Wellcome Collection Henry Cyril converted the chapel at Plas Newydd into the \"Gaiety Theatre\" to use for his performances Alex says because not much is known about Henry - his own diaries and letters were seemingly destroyed by the family after his death and most of the stories about him were told in sensationalist press reports - his life has become an opportunity for creatives to fill in many blanks with their own imaginings. Henry was an only child who was left motherless at a very young age and was raised for the first years of his life in Paris by relatives, where he was exposed to the theatrical world of the period. But then his father reclaimed him and he was sent to live at Plas Newydd on Anglesey, and his life followed the pattern of education at Eton and an affiliation with the military typical of his class. However, on the death of the 4th Marquess in 1898, Henry inherited the title, the lands and the money, and proceeded to live as he chose. He renamed Plas Newydd Anglesey Castle, converted the chapel to a performance space he called the Gaiety Theatre, and put on seemingly spectacular shows with elaborate and jaw-droppingly expensive costumes and props, inviting both notables and the local people in for free to witness his magnificence. He ran through most of a fortune that in today's money has been estimated at about  60m and was bankrupted, leaving a shadow of his inheritance. Estranged from his wife, he moved to Monte Carlo and died aged 29. WellcomeCollection Some of the flamboyant outfits Henry Cyril bedecked himself in 'It's a pity he spent all the money' And that is where Alex's branch of the family comes in. As he acknowledges, it is only because of Henry's lack of issue that he now holds the title of 8th Marquess, as it fell to Henry's cousin, Alex's grandfather, on his death. What does he make of Henry, from the perspective of the 21st Century? While acknowledging the loss of the fortune - \"it's a pity he spent all the money\", he laughs, while clarifying he didn't actually quite spend it all. \"He wasn't totally unique. He was part of a culture, although a minority culture, people like Oscar Wilde in this country and [Marcel] Proust in France, where he initially grew up. \"That early 20th Century artistic, sexual liberation stuff was going on there in a minority world. \"He wasn't unique in that sense or even in the context of the English aristocracy - you know the empire-building, soldierly stuff wasn't the only side of the aristocracy,\" he says, with a nod to another Henry Paget, this time the one on the column, 1st Marquess of Anglesey and veteran of the Battle of Waterloo, who lost his leg fighting alongside the Duke of Wellington. Pointing to Henry's father being a \"playboy who certainly did not take any aristocratic responsibility, noblesse oblige stuff, very seriously at all\", Henry can be viewed perhaps in a grand tradition of eccentric and hedonistic aristocrats, albeit one who stepped further outside the boundaries than was considered acceptable. Pamela Raith Costumes used in the show aim to recreate the extravagance - and sometimes copy the actual items - of those used by Henry Cyril in his plays. It was this sense of exclusion that spoke to How to Win Against History creator Seiriol Davies when they first came across the photos of Henry during a visit to Plas Newydd - which was been owned by the National Trust for half a century - as a child. In the midst of \"marvelling at all the pomp\", the playwright and actor from Anglesey was struck by the contrast between the lionisation of the 1st Marquess and his heirs and \"the little laminated photocopy of some pictures of [Henry] Blu-tacked on the wall next to the toilet. \"It said he was a very silly man who wasted all the family's money doing very silly plays. \"A little bell of proto-queer indignation rang in my tummy, and because I believe in swift and decisive action, decided to make a musical about it 25 years later.\" They describe Henry as \"mesmerising, fabulous, glamorous and totally out of his time, but also kind of lost\". As an only child without a mother, Alex agrees one interpretation of Henry's outlandish behaviour could be as a sort of search for connection. \"Maybe this was one way of creating an identity, which he certainly did. \"I do think he's a fascinating character no doubt about it, and his whole persona does fit in with David Bowie and that sort of thing. There's some truth in those kinds of connections and 'he was the inventor of the selfie' idea, which comes into the film or the musical.\" Seiriol calls their loose interpretation of Henry's life \"a screwball, riot comedy camp-o-rama but it has at its centre someone who doesn't even have his internal life because it's been eradicated. \"In this fiction that we're making about a character which is a bit like Henry in some ways - and this is not trying to be the truth about him - within our story he's constantly trying to find connection, find acceptance; trying to get someone to see him as him.\" Pamela Raith The Bristol Old Vic-produced show attempts to show a character like Henry Cyril desperately searching for connection and to be seen as he is.",

        "content": "Many experts had rigid views of how science should be done and didn't consider it a legitimate experiment. It had been funded by a wealthy individual rather than a government and conducted by self-taught science generalists rather than scientists with PhDs from academic institutions. Rand believes this would be far less controversial today. Meanwhile, because the public saw the project as a \"glass ark\" or a model of a future space colony, the biospherians were seen to be \"cheating\" when one of them was taken to hospital due to a finger severed in a rice-hulling machine, or when they installed the oxygen pump, Rand says. \"I think it's fair to speculate that the events that were perceived by journalists [and the public] as failures might have been seen as normal, valid experimental results if the project took place now,\" she says. The negative media perception   as well as disagreement around how to manage Biosphere 2 after the original experiment ended   created challenges for those overseeing the project, Adams says. In 1996, Ed Bass handed over management of the facility to Columbia University and eventually gifted it to the University of Arizona. Scientists at those institutions saw the unique opportunity that Biosphere 2 provided, says Adams. Ecologists who study how living systems work usually do so by analysing what happens in the aftermath of vicissitudes like heatwaves or drought, McGill says. But in order to predict how climate change, for instance, will alter Earth's ecosystems in the future, they need to recreate future conditions and see how living beings respond. Like a time machine, Biosphere 2 allows them to do just that. From its very first experiment, \"Biosphere 2 was just a really cool and vivid stake in the ground about the need for ecology to be predictive,\" McGill says. Today, Biosphere 2's rainforest is the stage for experiments testing how its real-world counterparts might fare under global warming. One study dialled up the temperature and found the forests to be surprisingly resilient to heat; rather, it's the drought associated with warming that hurt them. More recently, the ecologist Christiane Werner from the University of Freiburg, Germany, and her colleagues exposed the forest to a 70-day drought. They learned how some trees survive by tapping into deep, moist soil layers and that drought-stressed trees release more compounds called monoterpenes, which form airborne particles that could potentially serve as seeds for much-needed rain clouds. Thanks to Biosphere 2, \"you can send a whole grown forest into a drought and then monitor all these processes along the way\", she says.",

The excavation near Willersey, Gloucestershire, has also found what could be remnants of a Roman villa. The dig follows the discovery of two iron Roman cavalry swords during a metal detecting rally near Willersey two years ago. Those \"rare\" swords will go on display at the Corinium Museum, Cirencester, from 2 August, Historic England confirmed.

The City of London Corporation launched Revealing The City's Past, which is a project to reinterpret the statues of slave traders that include former Lord Mayor William Beckford and former MP Sir John Cass. The corporation said the plan \"reflects a commitment to historical accountability\" for its role in the transatlantic trade in enslaved African people. The Beckford and Cass statues now bear information plates condemning the men's role. PA Media A plaque condemning slave traders is attached to a statue of John Cass The plaques feature texts by artist and heritage professional Rachael Minott, alongside poems by John Agard and Courtney Conrad. William Beckford was twice Lord Mayor of London in the late 1700s who accrued wealth from plantations in Jamaica and held African slaves. Sir John Cass was a 17th and 18th-century merchant, MP and philanthropist who also profited from the slave trade. In January 2021, the City Corporation had voted to remove the statues but then decided on a \"retain and explain\" policy that added historical context.

        "title": "Sneh Bhargava: Indira Gandhi's final moments through the eyes of a pioneering woman doctor",
        "content": "A pioneering doctor remembers India leader Indira Gandhi's final moments 28 June 2025 Share Save Cherylann Mollan BBC News, Mumbai Share Save Juggernaut Books Sneh Bhargava was AIIMS Delhi's first and only woman director Not much about Sneh Bhargava's life seems ordinary. In 1984, she became the first woman to helm the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the capital Delhi - one of the country's top medical institutions - and in its almost 70-year history, remains the only woman to have done so. At 90, Dr Bhargava - one of India's pioneering radiologists - began writing her memoir, The Woman Who Ran AIIMS, which was published earlier this month, and at 95, continues to remain an active member in the medical community. From choosing radiology when it was still emerging in 1940s India to becoming one of its most well-known practitioners, Dr Bhargava's legacy is nothing short of extraordinary. Not unlike her first day on the job as director-to-be of AIIMS, which was nothing short of a trial by fire. It was the morning of 31 October 1984, and a meeting was under way at the hospital to confirm her appointment after India's then prime minister Indira Gandhi had selected her for the role. Juggernaut Books Bhargava continued working as a radiologist and professor till the age of 90 Dr Bhargava was not part of the meeting, but was in her office reviewing medical cases for the day. She recalls in her memoir hearing a colleague frantically call out to her, asking her to rush to the casualty ward. There, lying on a gurney was the very woman who had selected Dr Bhargava to head the hospital - Indira Gandhi. Her saffron sari was drenched in blood and she had no pulse. \"At the time, I didn't focus on it being the prime minister who was lying in front of me,\" Dr Bhargava told the BBC. \"My first thoughts were that we had to help her and also protect her from further harm,\" she said. Dr Bhargava was worried that a mob would storm the casualty ward, as a large crowd had already begun gathering outside the hospital. News began to trickle out: Gandhi had been shot by two Sikh bodyguards in revenge for Operation Blue Star, the military raid on Amritsar's Golden Temple in June to flush out militants. Gandhi's assassination sparked one of the deadliest riots India has seen, the beginnings of which Dr Bhargava began hearing about as she hastened to shift the prime minister to one of the building's top floors. There, in the operating theatre, a Sikh doctor fled the room the minute he heard how Gandhi had died. The news of her death had to be kept under wraps until her son, Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as prime minister. \"Until then, our job, for the next four hours, was to keep up the charade that we were trying to save her life, when in fact she was dead when she was brought to AIIMS,\" Dr Bhargava writes. Juggernaut Books Bhargava (second from left) at a picnic with her classmates from Lady Hardinge College, where she did her undergraduate course in medicine She also described the harrowing process of embalming the prime minister's body, which would lie in state in the capital for two days before cremation. \"The embalming chemical, when we injected it into different main arteries, kept oozing out,\" Dr Bhargava writes. A ballistic report would later reveal that over three dozen bullets had punctured Gandhi's body. But this wasn't the only remarkable episode in Dr Bhargava's long and illustrious career at AIIMS. In the book she shares fascinating anecdotes of her interactions with other prominent politicians, including India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. She also recalls Sonia Gandhi bringing her son, a young Rahul to AIIMS after an arrow grazed his head while he was playing. \"Sonia Gandhi told me that she had to bring Rahul to us because Rajiv (her husband) was meeting the King of Jordan and the latter had given him a fancy car as a gift, which her husband was keen to drive,\" she writes in the book. Rajiv Gandhi wanted to drive Rahul to AIIMS himself, without security, as a surprise - but Dr Bhargava firmly stopped him, citing safety concerns. But not every day was as exciting. Dr Bhargava recalls political pressure, including an MP who threatened her for not selecting his son-in-law for a job at AIIMS. On another occasion, two top politicians, including the federal health secretary, tried to handpick the AIIMS dean - though the decision was hers alone. Dr Bhargava says she stood firm against pressure, always prioritising patient care. She worked to establish radiology as a core part of diagnosis and treatment at AIIMS. When Dr Bhargava joined in the 1960s, AIIMS had only basic imaging tools. She trained colleagues to read subtle signs in black-and-white X-rays, always in context with the patient's history. She later pushed for better equipment, helping build one of India's leading radiology departments. Juggernaut Books Bhargava receiving a certificate of recognition in radiology",

The copies, made in 1538-9, were printed on parchment and carefully hand-coloured by Europe's finest artists and was the first authorised edition in English. Thomas Cromwell was a strong supporter of religious reform and these Bibles were commissioned by him as part of the campaign to convince the King. They have gone on display as part of the Treasures exhibition in the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, in what has been called \"a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\". Hidden in Plain Sight is a project that employs a range of technologies, from 3D microscopy to DNA analysis, which show for the first time how ancient books were used and modified. Research has revealed different layers to illustrations with deliberate modifications that were changed due to the political developments of the time. The project has revealed Cromwell had his portrait painted and pasted into the title page of the St John's copy   a move expertly hidden for centuries. The opening title page was further manipulated to gain Henry's support by altering an image of a courtly woman to resemble Jane Seymour, Henry's beloved and recently deceased, consort. National Library of Wales The copies were printed on parchment and carefully hand-coloured by Europe's finest artists Researchers on the project said these discoveries raises more questions about how the Bibles were made, with Dr Harry Spillane adding that technology was revealing more about the books to this day. He said: \"Although these books have been around for 500 years, it's only with new technologies that we have been able to see all of the changes that have been made underneath. \"We can see that bits of paper have been pasted on, or often multiple layers glued on as a more perfect design is completed. \"And seeing them side by side helps people understand how, even 500 years ago, changes are being made to images in ways that build on discussions we are having today about deep fakes and AI. People's faces are changing, images are moving around.\" Dr Harry Spillane says \"more is being revealed\" about the Bibles today Although the text is almost identical in both bibles, the illustrations vary much more. Dr Suzanne Paul from Cambridge University Library said the technology being used enabled specialists to learn more about \"the archaeology of the bibles\". \"We know particular workshops that were doing work for the royals and by analysing the different pigments in the book to other paintings and books from this time we can potentially find out where the bibles were made,\" she added. \"The artists might not have left their physical signature, but they might have left their chemical signature in the book for us to find.\" Henry VIII ordered copies of the Great Bible to be distributed to every parish in England and Wales, which was the catalyst for translating the Bible into Welsh in 1588, known as the William Morgan's Bible. The two Bibles are side-by-side for the first time since they were created",

        "content": "The story behind 'birthplace of lesbian marriage' 22 June 2025 Share Save Jessica Bradley & Hannah Sackville-Bryant BBC News, Yorkshire Share Save Hannah Sackville-Bryant/BBC Holy Trinity Church on Goodramgate, York, is where Anne Lister \"took the sacrament\" with her life partner Ann Walker Tucked away in a secluded street near York Minster, a stone's throw from one of the city's busiest shopping streets, is a church that played a fascinating role in lesbian history. Holy Trinity on Goodramgate, which dates back to the 12th Century, is where diarist and businesswoman Anne Lister \"married\" her partner, heiress Ann Walker, on Easter Sunday in 1834. Although same-sex marriage was not legal at the time, they took the sacrament together at Holy Communion and considered themselves wedded. Sarah Cowling, Churches Conservation Trust volunteer and Blue Badge tour guide, said that as a result, Holy Trinity really became the \"birthplace of lesbian marriage\". Although Lister's family owned the Shibden Hall estate near Halifax, she had a strong association with York, where she attended school and met many of her friends. After a two-year courtship with Walker, daughter of a Halifax landowner, Lister chose to take the sacrament to \"have something as close to a marriage as they could possibly get\", Ms Cowling said. \"In the February, they had pledged themselves to each other, and later on they had exchanged rings and made provisions to each other in their wills,\" she explained. Helena Whitbread, a historian and the editor and decoder of Lister's secret diaries, said she had three criteria for becoming \"married\": exchanging rings; declaring their love; and taking a vow before the altar. Lister wrote in her diary on 27 March 1834 that she and Walker were \"positively engaged\", Ms Whitbread said. Gentleman Jack s York connection Then, on 30 March, the couple attended the Easter Sunday service at Holy Trinity in York - both wearing their wedding rings. Holy Trinity was chosen partly because the Holy Communion did not feature in many Anglican services. The tradition of sharing bread and wine was always part of a marriage ceremony. \"That was their opportunity between now and Christmas time to take Communion together,\" Ms Cowling said. The church was a convenient option as they both had appointments in nearby Minster Yard, and Walker was staying in the village of Heworth. Taking the sacrament was \"momentous\", Ms Cowling said. \"Lister's diaries are the first written record, and so the first clear intent we've got, of any two women deciding they want to live in a marital-style relationship. \"Undoubtedly, women did before Anne, but we have no proof.\" However, Lister's intentions were not completely romantic: she wished to access Walker's considerable family fortune. Meanwhile, Ms Whitbread said it was also a way for Lister to affirm her gender identity. \"Anne needed to acquire the role of 'husband' in a relationship with a woman in order to boost her sense of her masculinity,\" she said. \"Psychologically, marriage is a necessity to Anne as a confirmation to herself that she has a right to marry - that is, to become a husband - a role which would bolster the masculine traits in her character.\" Hannah Sackville-Bryant/BBC Inside the church where the \"marriage\" took place However, Ms Whitbread added that there was evidence Walker did not attach as much value to the ceremony as Lister did. \"Even though they both had their rings on, she didn't seem to give as much importance to it,\" she said. \"It seemed a bit one-sided to me. In Anne's eyes, the ceremony should have sealed the matrimonial pact into which they had entered. \"Anne should have explained to Walker a bit more before going to the church, so Walker was more aware of the significance, but she didn't. \"She knelt at the altar with her thoughts and prayers, then walked out.\" Walker later moved in with Lister and her family at Shibden Hall. Lister died in 1840 while travelling in Georgia with Walker, who died in 1854 having returned to live on her family's Crow Nest estate in Halifax.",

Arthur Bulleid, born and raised in Glastonbury, found the former Iron Age settlement on the Avalon Marshes, and spent 15 years carefully excavating a wealth of artefacts, dated as far back as 250BC. Many are now housed in the Glastonbury Tribunal museum, but one in particular has become a local icon - a bowl. Pauline Plant, a volunteer at the Tribunal, said: \"It's incredibly rare, and incredibly important.\" Pauline Platt is a volunteer at the Tribunal The bowl became a symbol of Glastonbury. Ms Platt said: \"It was beautifully made, and beautifully decorated, and very unusual with the rivets that go half way down, and little triangle. \"When it was first discovered it became very famous, and people were making replicas... including a giant one which was hanging next door.\" The bowl is now behind glass, but Ms Platt said when she held it, she was \"terrified\" of having something so old in her hands. Elsewhere at the Tribunal there are more artefacts from the Lake Village which are historically important, including more pottery and Iron Age currency. But in the back of the museum, out at the Tudor Kitchen, is a log canoe which was initially understood to be Iron Age, but last year was carbon dated to the 7th Century, around Saxon times. Ms Platt said its not in great condition, partly due to its excavation and partly due to \"people taking bits of it for souvenirs\". She said the site is often regarded as a \"secret\". \"People walk past it a hundred times and always say it's never been open, but it has been for a couple of years.\"",

A fun fact: it's not just cities that have twin destinations; heritage railways do, too. I learn this while riding south-western Taiwan's recently restored Alishan Forest Railway, which reopened in 2024 as a tourist train, 118 years after steam locomotives first hauled timber along its tracks. One of the most passionate advocates for its restoration is Michael Reilly, the former British Representative to Taiwan. He's also company secretary for Wales' Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway and the reason why, in 2022, the Alishan Forest's Railway became its twin. The union was cemented by the presentation of a diesel engine, once used in Alishan, now ferrying holidaymakers through the rolling hills of Powys, Wales. With international visitor numbers to Taiwan booming and new routes   including flights from Emirates, timed specifically to suit Taiwan-bound travellers from the UK   It's not hard to see why the Taiwan Railway Administration was so supportive of the endeavour. It's an opportunity to show off the island's less-explored regions, showing visitors that there's more to Taiwan than Taipei's sky-scraping Taipei 101 tower and famous night markets. But this railway is more than just a tourist train   it provides an insight into Taiwan's history, starting with its colonisation by Japan.",

The Norman Cross Camp just south of Peterborough housed about 7,000 French prisoners and inspired the world's largest collection of prisoner craftwork. The historic site, which dates back to 1796, was bought by the Peterborough-based Nene Park Trust who want to introduce visitors to the site in September. Historian Paul Chamberlain, said it could provide a better understanding of a \"lost town\" that had a significant impact on the region more than 200 years ago. Historic England Archive There is no public access to the site, but Nene Park Trust has been developing plans to enable visits while ensuring the land is farmed sympathetically to preserve the archaeological remains The Norman Cross Camp operated from 1797 to 1814 and functioned as a self-contained town with barracks, offices, a hospital, school, market place and banking. It was far from the sea, making it difficult for escapees to return to France, and was away from potential invasion areas, in a fertile part of the country. BBC History: Napoleon, Nelson and the French Threat It closed in August 1814 and two years later the buildings were demolished, and the site sold. The land, which sits off the A1(M) at junction 16 for Yaxley and south Peterborough, was used for arable crops and grazing and is primarily under pasture, but the site still contains the earthworks and buried remains of the camp. Peterborough Museum & Art Gallery Prisoners created items from bone and straw to sell at the camp market and more than 800 of these are at Peterborough Museum & Art Gallery Napoleonic era author and historian, Mr Chamberlain, said: \"Norman Cross Prison Depot is unique in that it is an historic site that continues to tell its story, involving communities, both local and national. \"This acquisition will enable more of the story to be told for future generations and provide us with a better understanding of a lost town that had a significant impact on the region over 200 years ago.\" Luton Culture Trust The acquisition of the site (depicted when it was in use) fulfilled the ambition of long-term resident, Derek Lopez, who died before seeing his vision completed. It was bought by Nene Park Trust with grants from Historic England and The National Lottery Heritage Fund About 1,770 French, Dutch and German prisoners who died during their time at the camp have been memorialised at a nearby Norman Cross Eagle Monument.

Paul Hazelton says he is using old photographs and chalk to recreate the Shell Grotto Margate's east wall. The grotto is a subterranean passageway which is about 100ft (30m) long and the chalk walls are covered with about 4.6 million shells. Mr Hazelton, from Margate, told the BBC it was \"quite a daunting task\" as it was important to preserve the grotto's uniqueness and history. Jadzia Samuel/BBC The Shell Grotto's origins are shrouded in mystery but it continues to fascinate visitors \"When people visit Margate, the Shell Grotto is a must-see attraction,\" Mr Hazelton said. \"It's like a pilgrimage so I feel a great responsibility to restore the damaged wall.\" When the grotto was rediscovered by accident in the 1830s many visitors flocked to see its wonders. During World War Two, the cottage above the grotto was bombed, destroying part of the artwork. Mr Hazelton says he has spent more than 100 hours on the mosaic saying he hopes it will pay homage to the site. Jadzia Samuel/BBC The Shell Grotto walls have about 4.6 million shells, including mussels, whelks, oysters, cockles, limpets and razor shells The Shell Grotto is shrouded in mystery and historians are still trying to figure out its origins and purpose. Manager of the grotto, Nicky Paton, said: \"There are many theories regarding the history of these shells. They range from the Roman times to the 18th Century.\" Other theories suggest they may have been a meeting place of a secret society, or a place of worship. The shells on the walls include mussels, whelks, oysters, cockles, limpets and razor shells. Although the shells have lost their colour due to gas lamps used in the 19th Century, the tunnels continue to capture the imagination and fascination of visitors.

        "content": "Humans have simply not evolved to survive in the incredibly cold temperatures, brutal winds and lack of oxygen that exists there. The thinness of the atmosphere means that mountaineers suffer hypoxia, where their vital organs do not get enough oxygen and bodies begin to break down. As their brains and lungs get starved of oxygen, their heart rate spikes, increasing their risk of a heart attack. The shortage of oxygen to the brain causes it to swell, triggering headaches, nausea and quickly impairing a climber's judgment and ability to make decisions, especially when they are under stress. As their brains swell, mountaineers have been known to experience delirium, talking to people who aren't there, burrowing in the snow or even shedding their clothing. Tenzing and Hillary   along with the others on the expedition   had planned for this slowly acclimating themselves to the harsh conditions in the Himalayas by establishing a series of camps at increasing altitudes, gradually making their way up the mountain through April and May, 1953. This allowed their bodies time to expand their lung capacity and produce more haemoglobin   the protein in red blood cells that helps carry oxygen from the lungs to the other parts of the body   to compensate for the decreasing oxygen as they moved towards Everest's peak. But this acclimatisation was also not without risk for the team as too much haemoglobin thickens the blood. This makes circulation more difficult, which increases the likelihood of a stroke and accumulation of fluid in the lungs. However, it is virtually impossible to acclimatise your body at any altitude above 6,000m (19,700ft) and the vertical rock face they needed to scale that sat 8,790m (28,839ft) above sea level. So, the climbers had brought with them specially designed oxygen apparatus, which would help combat the effects of the altitude's atmosphere. But they were under no illusion about the magnitude of the challenge facing them. Three days earlier the expedition's primary climbing team, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within 100m (328 ft) of the summit. But, exhausted by the climb, beset by malfunctioning oxygen sets and battered by freezing winds, they had been forced to turn back before reaching the top. A team effort In the early hours of 29 May 1953, Tenzing and Hillary began the expedition's second attempt, battling their way through the snow along the exposed ridgeline towards the peak. As they scrambled over icy ridges, the New Zealand mountaineer started having his own doubts about if they could go on, Hillary's son, Peter, told BBC Witness History in 2023. \"One of the things I remember most is his description of moving up the steep snow and ice flanks up towards the south summit. He says he was out in front, cutting these steps, great sheet of snow and ice breaking loose, and just taking off down these steep slopes into the Kangshung Face (eastern-facing side) of Everest dropping down into Tibet. And he said, and I have seen it in his diary as well, he started having some doubts about the conditions, whether it was safe to go on,\" he said. \"I always remember him telling this story with a twinkle in his eye and a wry smile, and he looked down at Tenzing and he said they both smiled at each other and kept on going despite those conditions.\"",

The project was a grand failure   but 50 years on, the idea still won't completely go away. To the west of Russia's Ural Mountains lies a picturesque body of water called Nuclear Lake. It's difficult to access, and visitors have to travel north by boat along the Kolva and Visherka rivers from the small town of Nyrob, where the tsars once exiled their political opponents. The lake itself, which is about 690m (2,300ft) at its widest point, is not linked directly to the dozens of nearby waterways, and the final approach is on foot along a boggy track. To get to its shores, you have to pass rusting metal signs warning you are entering a \"radiation danger zone\" and that drilling and construction are forbidden. Large earth mounds snake around the edge of the lake. \"The water was transparent,\" says Andrei Fadeev, a Russian blogger from the city of Perm, who travelled to Nuclear Lake on a sunny day in the summer of 2024. \"I liked it,\" he says, even though his dosimeter showed spots where radiation levels were higher than usual. \"There wasn't an atmosphere of a threat or something. On the contrary  I think the northern taiga [boreal forest] has just recaptured the place.\" Nuclear Lake was formed on 23 February 1971 when the Soviet Union simultaneously fired three nuclear devices buried 127m (417ft) underground. The yield of each device was 15 kilotonnes (about the same as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945).

Rachel Tobin's play, The Last Free Rave, is touring local venues this August and is based on the Castlemorton rave, which started as a small free festival near Malvern and became the largest illegal rave ever held in the UK. Ms Tobin said she wanted to tell a fictional story, based on tales she has heard over the years, of an interaction between a reveller and a married farming couple. The production will be part of the Malvern Ink & Curtains Festival. The first ever play about the Castlemorton rave Ms Tobin said she had lived in the area for 20 years and had discovered \"so much folklore\" locally about the rave, which started during a bank holiday weekend on 22 May 1992. \"The whole play is set in a farmhouse,\" she said, \"and the rave is happening around the farmhouse. \"So it's only when the doors are open, the windows are open, that you hear the rave going on.\" She said the production also included footage from the time, and interviews with people as the event made news headlines. 'Absolute chaos' Ms Tobin said tales from the rave included stories about things disappearing, fenceposts vanishing, sheep going missing, but added: \"I don't think some of it probably even happened, but it gets a little exaggerated generation to generation.\" \"It was absolute chaos for six days,\" she said. \"The police, of course, were powerless, so they were sitting around on the outskirts trying to just keep everything calm.\" After the rave, injunctions and road blocks were used to prevent a similar event happening again. In 1994, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act was passed, giving police powers to stop vehicles anywhere within five miles (8km) of a rave and turn them away.

        "content": "A surprise dead-of-night attack helped lead to US independence from the British. Now, a series of events are commemorating the region's pivotal role in shaping the nascent nation. In the violet-grey twilight before dawn in May 1775, a skeleton crew of soldiers were asleep inside Fort Ticonderoga, a British-held garrison on the banks of Lake Champlain in New York's Adirondack region, when a series of shouts rang out. Rushing to their posts, the men were stunned by the sight of six dozen American soldiers streaming over the fort's walls, flintlock rifles in hand, demanding surrender. With the British outnumbered and taken off guard, American victory was swift and bloodless. The fort's commander, sergeants, gunners and artillerymen were imprisoned and the invading forces captured 100 cannons and valuable weapons for the Continental Army. The surprise attack was a pivotal moment in the lead-up to the American War of Independence and marked the Continental forces' first offensive victory of the war that led to the United States' founding in 1776. This year, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the conflict that shaped the nation, Fort Ticonderoga is hosting a series of new museum exhibits alongside its regular lineup of historical reenactments, guided tours and boat cruises   all of which provides travellers with a great jumping-off point to explore a region replete in Revolutionary War history.",

        "content": "It's the result of a five-year-long campaign by activists and founders of the Witches of Scotland podcast Zoe Venditozzi and Claire Mitchell, who have now authored a book How to Kill a Witch: A Guide for the Patriarchy, an account of the Scottish witch trials   out this week in the UK, and in the autumn in the US. The book outlines how, as Venditozzi tells the BBC, \"the belief system and social anxiety of the time created a perfect storm to find scapegoats and deal with them harshly\". In 2022 the pair achieved one of their goals when Scotland's then first minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology to the Scots who were persecuted under the law in a \"colossal injustice\". Some female Ministers in the Church of Scotland have since also issued an apology. The subject of the witch trials is currently piquing the imaginations of fiction writers too. Hex by Jenni Fagan tells the tale of \"one of the most turbulent moments in Scotland's history: the North Berwick Witch Trials\". The novel Bright I Burn by Molly Aitken is a fictionalised account of the first woman in Ireland accused of being a witch. And recent historical thriller The Wicked of the Earth by AD Bergin is based around the witch trials in Newcastle, England. In How to Kill a Witch, the authors show how that moment on King James's voyage was the point from which the story unfurled. \"James VI and I [he was the sixth King James of Scotland and the first of England] had a huge impact on the witch trials,\" explains co-author Mitchell, who is also a practicing KC (barrister) specialising in criminal law and human rights. Among \"evidence\" were accounts of supposed witches surfing the sea in sieves and dancing in North Berwick church. \"A few years later James wrote the book Daemonology   a 'how to' guide to find and deal with witches and other spirits\". The book was widely disseminated   and his message spread rapidly. The Witchcraft Act was designed to enforce \"godliness\" in the newly Protestant Scotland, with the law condemning anyone who appeared to be \"conspiring with the devil\".",

The BBC had reported earlier this month that the skeleton had been left inside an unprotected tarpaulin shelter close to the excavation site in western Gujarat state since 2019 because of bureaucratic wrangling. On Thursday, the skeleton was shifted to a local museum, just a few miles away from where it was unearthed. Authorities say that it will be placed on display for the public after administrative procedures are completed. The skeleton being transported from the shed to the museum Mahendra Surela, curator of the Archaeological Experiential Museum in Vadnagar where the skeleton has now been shifted, told the BBC that the skeleton was transported with \"utmost care\" and under the supervision of several experts. He added that officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) - the agency responsible for preservation of archaeological research - will examine the skeleton before taking a decision on where and how the skeleton should be displayed in the museum. It is currently placed next to the reception and is fenced in by a protective barrier. \"It is likely that we may shift it to the second floor, where a photograph of the skeleton is already placed,\" Mr Surela said. Archaeologist Abhijit Ambekar, who discovered the skeleton, said that he was happy that the significant find was getting the attention it deserved.

The Great Baddow Hoard, which was found in 2020, is a \"nationally significant\" find because it is Britain's largest recorded Iron Age gold coin hoard, according to experts. It was declared treasure by a coroner and has been acquired by the Museum of Chelmsford, Essex, after receiving a  250,000 National Lottery Heritage Fund grant. Curator Claire Willetts said it \"could have been intended as a tribute payment to Roman general Julius Caesar\". Fountain Media Museum curator Claire Willetts suggested it may have been buried at a time of upheaval in the wake of Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain The hoard come from a time when Iron Age tribes first began minting their own coins using regional dies (metal stamps) and it was found with fragments of a possible container or vessel. It is the first archaeological evidence of aggression between two neighbouring Iron Age tribes, Trinovantes and Catuvellauni, said the museum's curator, Claire Willetts. \"The hoard's discovery in what is traditionally considered Trinovantian territory at Great Baddow may indicate movement or influence from western tribal groups into the east, potentially aligning with accounts of upheaval during Caesar's second invasion of Britain in 54 BC,\" she said. Previously, the only evidence of this was in Roman sources. Essex finds liaison officer Lori Rogerson described it as \"a nationally significant discovery\". \"In the coming years, visitors seeing the hoard at the Museum of Chelmsford will be in awe at its size and gold content and they'll be led to ask questions such as, 'Who owned such a large stash of precious coins?' and, 'Why was it put in the ground, never to be returned to?'\", she said. Trustees of the British Museum Possible leather fragments and a red glass item were found with coins, such as this Norfolk wolf stater, according to the British Museum Having remained in the earth for more than 2,000 years, a metal detectorist found the collection on private land, but he had not sought permission to detect there. Shane Wood admitted the theft of 22 Staters and one quarter Stater, and failing to notify the coroner of the find under the Treasure Act 1996 at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court in April 2021. As well as fines, he had his metal detector destroyed. Having initially failed to declare the find under the Treasure Act, his actions meant the potential to understand its archaeological context was limited. The British Museum's independent Treasure Valuation Committee recommended Wood should not receive a reward, so only the landowner was rewarded for the find. The law and metal detecting Fountain Media It offers \"a tantalising, exciting, and colourful story of the city's prehistoric past\", said finds liaison officer Lori Rogerson No search can begin until permission has been given by the landowner All finds belong to the landowner Any find in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that is more than 300 years old, made of gold or silver, or found with gold or silver artefacts, could be treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act These must be reported to the appropriate county finds liaison officer Source: Portable Antiquities Scheme Fountain Media She believes visitors to the museum \"will be in awe at its size and gold content\" Jennie Lardge, Chelmsford City Council's cabinet deputy for cultural services, said: \"I hope many of our residents, especially those in Great Baddow, will feel as I do, an immense pride in this outstanding piece of Britain's history uncovered here in Chelmsford.\" The city council, Friends of Chelmsford Museums, Essex Society for Archaeology and History, Essex Heritage Trust, Council for British Archaeology East, and Essex Numismatics Society were among those who also contributed funds so the museum could acquire the find.

        "content": "Anti-aircraft guns and high-voltage power lines The 617 Squadron bombers set off in three waves, each targeting a different dam. Buckley was in the first wave of nine planes led by the squadron's 24-year-old Wing Commander Guy Gibson. As the rear gunner in a bomber piloted by Dave Shannon, Buckley told the BBC that he remembered feeling \"glad that we were on our way\" as the plane took off from the runway. \"We set course for the enemy coast. It was a full moon, it was almost like daylight,\" he said. The dangerous mission required exceptional flying skill and precision navigation. To avoid radar, the Lancasters needed to fly at low altitudes on flight routes that weaved in and out of positions where there were known anti-aircraft guns. At least three planes were shot down when they strayed off their routes, while two others crashed because they were flying low enough to hit high-voltage power lines. WATCH: 'There were many months of doubt and frustration, but the idea worked'. Buckley's Lancaster was one of the ones that made it to the rendezvous over the 2,000ft-long (650m) M hne Dam. Gibson decided to take the bombing run, while the others circled, waiting for their chance. The M hne approach was especially hazardous. Surrounded by tree-covered hills, the aircrew were exposed to flak from gunners in the towers as they dropped low across the surface of the water. When it came to Buckley's bomber's turn, four other Lancasters had already dropped their bombs, and one plane had crashed after being hit by enemy fire and the blast of its own bouncing bomb. But the M hne Dam was still standing. Because the Lancaster's altimeter was not accurate enough, spotlights had been installed at each end of the aircraft to tell the airmen when they were at the right height. \"We circled, we had to be 60ft exactly, we had a spotlight in the nose of the aircraft and a spotlight in the tail and they converged at exactly 60ft,\" said Buckley. \"Number five was [pilot David] Maltby, well, he dropped his weapon successfully. We were just on the run in and Gibson called us off   the dam was gone.\"",

The Victorian-built Moot Hall in Colchester has been closed to the public since early 2023 after structural assessments revealed the fibrous plaster ceiling posed a safety risk. The city council said the restoration had taken almost \"9,500 hours of skilled craftsmanship\" over a five-month period. The hall, on the second floor of the town hall, is renowned for its high ceiling, stained glass windows, and custom-built Norman and Beard organ. The Town Hall was built in 1898 by architect John Belcher but surveys carried out in 2023 uncovered critical issues in the plaster s support system, evidence of water damage and condensation, structural weaknesses, debris build-up, and added loads from fixtures. The ceiling's extensive restoration programme began following a formal application to Historic England, along with comprehensive bat and owl surveys to safeguard protected species. Colchester City Council Moot Hall is on the second floor of the town hall Colchester City Council The hall is a Grade I listed building, meaning it is of exceptional architectural or historic interest Work included tying individual ornate ceiling panels to the roof structure with thousands of metres of stainless-steel wire and creating 56 new plaster panels cast to match the hardboard panels in the central section. Lambswool insulation was also laid in two layers along the ceiling length to maintain traditional building methods and improve energy efficiency. The project was carried out using tower scaffolds and internal ceiling access, \"demanding intense physical effort from the restoration team\", the council said. Its leader, Liberal Democrat David King, said the \"transformation\" was \"a restoration fit for future generations\". He praised the work of those involved and said: \"Their efforts have ensured that the Moot Hall will once again serve as a civic and cultural landmark for our community.\" Elizabeth Hirst, head of Hirst Conservation which carried out the restoration, described the project as \"challenging\" but said it had been \"a privilege\" to work on Moot Hall's ceiling.

The hall is found on Rougham Estate near Bury St Edmunds, but it is off limits to members of the public and can be visited only during guided tours. During its history it has been the scene of huge parties spanning several days, and it was bombed during World War Two. George Agnew, whose family has owned the estate since 1904, said the crumbling walls added to the allure of the site. Mr Agnew's father demolished part of the building several decades ago for safety reasons and almost had the rest of it brought down. \"I was away doing some studying abroad and I came back and he was about to have the rest of it demolished,\" Mr Agnew explained. \"There was a site meeting up here with a demolition people and my brother and I insisted that it wasn't pulled down, which is why it's here now. \"But in the back of my head there's this voice the whole time of my father saying, 'I hope you haven't made a mistake here'.\" Matt Marvel/BBC George Agnew believes Rougham Hall's current state is what has kept people's interest alive If the hall's deteriorating walls could talk, they would share incredible tales of times gone by. In 1940 the hall was bombed by the German Luftwaffe, the reasons for which are still not really known. The bomber initially flew around the house dropping flares before the first bomb fell straight through the middle of the house and exploded. No-one was injured, but Mr Agnew theorised the Germans had perhaps confused the house with another owned by the Rothschild family nearby. \"In a sort of way it saved the history of this building,\" he said. \"I feel it's almost like the shock that saved the building.\" The ruins of Rougham Mr Agnew said the hall was still \"very impressive\" and he was keen to preserve it in its current state. He said minimising the number of people visiting it would help. \"It's not to stop people enjoying it, it's that the building is very delicate and we get a lot of people coming here who shouldn't be,\" he said. \"I'm trying to get the message through to keep everybody safe while enjoying and preserving it for the future.\" Contributed Jane Bennet-Earle has traced the Bennet history back to the early 1600s before her family took over Rougham Hall Jane Bennet-Earle is a descendant of the family that owned Rougham Hall years before Mr Agnew's family. In the late 1700s, Roger Kedington was the owner of the estate and had one legitimate child, a daughter called Jane Judith. When he died in 1818, the estate passed to his daughter's husband   Philip Bennet, who was originally from the Bath area. The hall passed down generations of her family before it was sold in 1893 for  80,000   the equivalent of about  9m in today's money   to the owner of the London Evening Standard, and later it was sold to Mr Agnew's family. The ruins of Rougham Mrs Bennet-Earle is passionate about her family's history and, despite living in Australia, she regularly visits. \"The icing on the cake last visit was George taking us to where the Bennet graves are in the churchyard,\" she said. \"I couldn't find them... they were completely covered. You wouldn't even know there was a grave there. \"I had wanted to find those for 20 years. I found them and there was Party Boy.\" Party Boy was another Philip Bennet, born in 1837 at Rougham Hall who held a three-day party for his 21st birthday. Mrs Bennet-Earle said no expenses were spared, with hundreds of guests invited, and a song was written at the time about it. Matt Marvel/BBC George Agnew plans to grow a wild garden outside Rougham Hall Like Mr Agnew, Mrs Bennet-Earle does not see any point in restoring the hall and she believes its current state is what captures people's interest. \"From the state it's in, to restore that I think would be very, very expensive,\" she said. \"It's beautiful as it is, it attracts people as it is, and it's quite unique. I think it adds to its beauty. \"To leave it as it is is fine by me.\" Follow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

The Battle of Naseby, in Northamptonshire, was not only a turning point in the British Civil Wars, but also led to Britain and Ireland being ruled from Westminster for the first time, said curator Stuart Orme. The forces of Charles I were decisively defeated by Parliament's new uniformed army and the king would be forced to surrender within a year. The map and other objects associated with the battle have gone on display at the Cromwell Museum in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. The Cromwell Museum Oliver Cromwell's military successes meant the Huntingdon-born man would eventually rise to become Lord Protector of England in the 1650s The battle was fought on 14 June 1645. Nearly 25,000 men took part and by midday the king was defeated. Mr Orme said: \"It was every bit as brutal as modern civil wars, including the massacre of about 100 mostly Welsh civilians belonging to the Royalist side by Parliamentary forces in its aftermath.\" The fold-out map belonged to a book published in 1647 which charted the victories of Parliament's New Model Army. The Cromwell Museum Artists rarely illustrated battles in the 17th Century, said curator Stuart Orme, and it is a rare original copy from 1647 Most surviving copies were lost, making it \"one of the few contemporary images of a Civil War battle\", according to Mr Orme. \"The exhibition includes an animated version of the map, including the real human stories of those who took part,\" he continued. They range from Royalist Bridget Rumney, whose mother and sons were massacred by the Parliamentary forces, and Parliamentarian Maj John Francis, who was killed in the battle. The Cromwell Museum The hilt of the carving knife matches that of a Sri Lankan style of sword, which was very fashionable in the 17th Century, said Mr Orme The discovery of the king's private papers, left behind in the rout, revealed he had been in correspondence with European Roman Catholic countries. This compounded the Protestant Parliamentarian leaders' distrust of Charles I and ultimately led to his execution. It was also \"the battle that transformed Britain\", introducing a standing army which was uniformed in red cloth - the original red coats - and still the dress uniform for the British Army, added Mr Orme. \"We call it the English Civil War but this is the biggest misnomer of history,\" he said. \"It's something that affected the whole of the country not just England, with Britain and Ireland ruled from Westminster for the first time in the 1650s.\" Other objects on display include a 17th Century helmet reputed to have been worn by Oliver Cromwell in the battle, but probably used at his 1658 state funeral, and a carving set made by a local farmer from a sword captured at the battle - the hilt for which was carved as far away as Sri Lanka. The Cromwell Museum The helmet was lined in black velvet and Mr Orme said as a result it was probably worn during Oliver Cromwell's state funeral rather than used in battle Follow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

The 6,000-year-old piece of oak, found in Boxford, Berkshire, was only the second wood carving to be discovered from the Mesolithic period in the country. It was found by chance in peat about 1.5m (5ft) below ground as a workshop was being built by landowner Derek Fawcett in 2019. He contacted West Berkshire Council's archaeologists, who passed it onto Historic England, which conserved it and carried out age analysis before it was displayed at West Berkshire Museum in Newbury. Experts could not use dendrochronology - more commonly known as tree-ring dating - to find a match in the wood but were able to take radiocarbon measurements from two single annual tree rings. They found there was a 95% probability that the final ring formed in the wood dates back to 4640 BC to 4605 BC, during the Mesolithic period or the Middle Stone Age. Historic England The timber was preserved in peat at the bottom of a trench that had been dug for foundations for a workshop At that time, people were tending to live a more settled lifestyle and moving away from hunting and gathering. The Berkshire wood is 2,000 years older than Stonehenge and 500 years older than the other known piece of carved Mesolithic timber, which was found near Maerdy in Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales, in 2012. The meanings behind the markings on the wood are not known but they are reminiscent of the decoration seen in early Neolithic pottery. \"We are absolutely delighted to be installing this incredible artefact,\" Marie-Louise Kerr, the museum's curator, said. \"It might not look like very much when you first see it but it's something that was made by the people of West Berkshire 6,000 years ago.\" The wood is now slightly smaller than when it was found after tests and was conserved with a waxy material called polyethylene glycol, followed by freeze-drying. The council said it was working with the Boxford Heritage Centre over the possibility of putting the wood on display there in the future. You can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, , or Instagram.",

        "content": "Left for dead again: Ancient Indian skeleton still waiting for permanent address 5 May 2025 Share Save Cherylann Mollan, BBC News, Mumbai and Roxy Gagdekar Chhara, BBC Gujarati, Vadnagar Share Save Kushal Batunge/BBC The skeleton has been placed inside a makeshift tent for now A 1,000 year-old human skeleton buried sitting cross-legged in India is still without a museum to house it because of bureaucratic wrangling, six years after it was unearthed. Archaeologist Abhijit Ambekar made the significant discovery in 2019, when he spotted what looked like the top of a human skull while excavating in western Gujarat state. As his team dug deeper, they found the well-preserved remains in a pit in what appeared to be a meditative posture. Similar remains have been found at only three other sites in India. But officials are still arguing over who should take charge of the skeleton. It remains in a makeshift shelter   not far from a new museum of local archaeology. Bhakarba Thakor Abhijit Ambekar (right) brushing soil off the skeleton Abhijit Ambekar says the skeleton - found in the town of Vadnagar - is likely to belong to the Solanki period. The Solanki dynasty, also known as the Chaulukya dynasty, ruled over parts of modern-day Gujarat between 940 to 1300 CE. The skeleton's right arm rested on its lap and its left arm lay suspended in the air, as if resting on a stick. \"The skeleton is an extremely valuable find, not just for Vadnagar but for the whole country. It can help us understand how our ancestors lived, and reveal details about the past that are yet unknown,\" says Dr Ambekar, who heads the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) division in Mumbai, and led the team that found the skeleton. That it is yet to find a proper resting place, despite its archaeological significance, appears to come down to red tape. Mr Ambekar says the Gujarat government's plan for all artefacts excavated from Vadnagar was to place them in local museums. He says around 9,000 artefacts, including the skeleton, that were excavated from Vadnagar between 2016 and 2022 by the ASI and had been handed over to the Gujarat government have been placed in local museums - except for the skeleton. However, the state government says the skeleton is still in the possession of the ASI. \"As proper process was not followed, it [the skeleton] was not placed in the museum,\" Pankaj Sharma, director of the state's Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, told the BBC. Yadubir Singh Rawat, director general of the ASI, did not respond to the BBC's questions on the matter. M Thennarasan, principal secretary of the state's Sports, Youth and Cultural Activities Department told the BBC, that authorities were working on shifting the skeleton to a museum as soon as possible. Bhakarba Thakor The skeleton was coated with materials to protect it Excavating the skeleton was a time-consuming process, Mr Ambekar says, adding that it took two months to complete. Various tools were used to carefully brush the soil away and free the skeleton from its ancient grave. It is currently housed in a tarpaulin shelter in Vadnagar, unprotected by security guards and exposed to natural elements. Locals sometimes bring relatives and friends to see the skeleton - a curiosity that has put a spotlight on the town, which is also the birthplace of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. What's interesting is that just a short distance away is the new Archaeological Experiential Museum - inaugurated by India's home minister in January. According to a government press release, the museum has been built at a cost of $35m and is spread across 12,500 sq m. It boasts that it showcases \"Vadnagar's 2,500-year-old history with over 5,000 artefacts, including ceramics, coins, tools and skeletal remains\". While the museum has a massive framed photo of the skeleton, it does not house the actual remains. Vadnagar is a historically significant region in Gujarat and excavations by the ASI have found traces of human settlements dating back to more than 2,000 years ago. Mr Ambekar says that portions of an earthen rampart believed to have been built by the region's first settlers exists even today. Digs have also revealed remnants of ancient Buddhist monasteries and stupas. These findings and others   such as terracotta figurines, coins, shell jewellery and stone and copper plate inscriptions - have helped archaeologists establish seven cultural sequences or phases in the area, starting from around the 2nd Century BCE and dating all the way up to the 19th Century CE. Mr Ambekar says the age of the skeleton he and his team found was estimated based on a DNA analysis of its teeth and a stratigraphic study of the excavation site. Stratigraphy involves studying rock sediments or layers of earth to determine their age. This is then used to establish the chronology of historical events or the approximate age of artefacts. \"The DNA analysis tells us that the skeleton is of local ancestry and belongs to a man in his forties, but more studies need to be done to understand his diet and lifestyle, which will in turn give us a better understanding of the region as it existed 1,000 years ago,\" he says. Bhakarba Thakor A crane was used to transport the wooden box containing the skeleton to its present site It could also shed light on the phenomenon of \"samadhi burials\" - an ancient burial practice among Hindus where revered figures were buried instead of being cremated, Mr Ambekar says. He adds that the skeleton had managed to survive the passage of time because the soil around it had remained undisturbed and displayed characteristics that prevent skeletal decay. Extricating the skeleton from the site and moving it to its current location was not an easy task. First, a block of earth with the skeleton nestled inside was cut out from the soil surrounding it. The skeleton and soil were treated with different chemicals to consolidate their structures. The block of earth was then put into a wooden box filled with wet mud and a crane was used to move the box to its current site. The entire operation took six days to complete, says Mr Ambekar.

Cotswold Archaeology unearthed a lime kiln during work on the Centre Severn site near Tenpin in Barnwood, Gloucester, known to the Romans as Glevum, between September 2020 and February 2021. The structure, measuring 4m (13ft) across and 2m (6.5ft) high, would have been covered in earth and turf and used to make quicklime, a key ingredient in building materials such as mortar and cement. Archaeologists also discovered two Roman buildings, and the grave of a woman in her 40s, radiocarbon dated to AD 226-336 which is during the time of Roman Britain. The lime kiln, made of stone blocks set in clay, is thought to be the first excavated in Gloucestershire. Cotswold Archaeology believes it had a relatively short working life having either collapsed naturally or been dismantled. Earlier surveys at the Centre Severn site suggested extensive Roman remains may lie underground. Later Roman activity cut a ditch through its north-eastern side, further confirming that it was abandoned by the 3rd Century. Cotswold Archaeology The limekiln, found in Barnwood, Gloucester, is several metres tall Paolo Guarino, post excavation assistant manager at Cotswold Archaeology, said it was a significant find. \"The kiln itself is quite rare in Gloucestershire. \"As far as I know, this is the only one that has been fully excavated in the county. \"Roman kilns are well-known but not that widespread.\" Mr Guarino said the kiln may have been part of a larger settlement. The findings from the excavation have allowed the group to build a better picture of how the past landscape may have looked. \"We are able to tell a bit more detail every time we get our hands on it,\" he added.

        "content": "Eighty years after the end of World War Two, blasted trees and rubble forests tell a hidden story of wartime bombardment and Nazi terror. In the early 1950s, Rudolf Schr der, a young gardener, led a group of apprentices through the abandoned plots of bombed houses in post-war Dresden. Their quest: to find tree saplings for planting along the city's streets. Dresden was still ravaged by the firebombing in February 1945 that killed tens of thousands of civilians. But slowly, here and in other cities across Germany, survivors were starting a green recovery. \"We searched the ruins of buildings with gardens for saplings and found lots of them   linden trees, maple, oak. We dug them up, and planted the best ones along the streets,\" recalls Schr der, who was born in 1933, speaking from his home in Dresden. \"It was a hard time, but we were full of hope.\" Saplings were hard to find as so many trees in public parks had been destroyed, and had to be replaced with stock from nurseries outside of the bombed city. It was when those nurseries ran out that Schr der and his friends resorted to the abandoned gardens   where many saplings had sprung up as the plots were left untended. There were enough young trees for some to be taken and replanted along the streets to cheer up the public, and others to be left in place, according to Schr der. Today, some of those rubble-sourced street trees planted by Schr der and his team still stand, for example along the Krenkelstra e street in Dresden, he says.",

An enormous pile of stones is all that remains of the structure built by Neolithic farmers at Boreland in Knockman Wood, north of Newton Stewart.

A video of how the tomb would have looked can be viewed on an interpretation panel at the site or on the Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) website. FLS All the remains of the cairn now is a pile of stones FLS archaeologist Matt Ritchie said: \"This visualisation allows us to imagine what this Clyde Cairn - a type of tomb characteristic of south-west Scotland   would have looked like when it was first built. \"The architecture suggests its use as both a tomb for the dead, where people placed the deceased in the chambers within the cairn, and a space for the living, where people could pay their respects within the forecourt.\" He said archeological studies could only reveal the \"bare bones\" of the cairn's story, leaving \"much to the imagination\". \"They were built by a vibrant ancient society with beliefs, traditions and practices that would seem very strange to us today,\" he said. Marcus Abbott A video allows visitors to see how the cairn might have looked when it was in use Mr Ritchie added that hopefully watching the video and seeing the cairn come to life could answer some questions visitors might have. \"Of the cairns that survive across Scotland, some remain closed, their secrets hidden beneath huge mounds of stone, such as at Boreland in Galloway,\" he said. \"Others bear the ravages of time, their features masked by rubble and collapse, or have been disturbed by treasure-hunters, their chambers ripped open and exposed. \"Many more have simply been lost over time.\"",

For years, nobody has been allowed to peek behind the ornate stone walls and intricate rose window of the Catholic Apostolic Church in Albury. But historian Trevor Brook said the estate was kept in pristine condition to be \"ready for use\" when, in Christianity, Jesus Christ returns to the earth. The church sits as a monument to a religious sect which once reached from Albury out to the UK and the world. \"Nobody, not even locals can visit. It's not to be used for secular activity or to visit or for anything. It is purely maintained for the appropriate time,\" Mr Brook said. \"It's curious and intriguing that you can still do this sort of thing and keep it so closed and secret. \"This is an astonishing thing he has left for us all. The church regard it as a visible memorial to the lord's work by apostles, a place of pilgrimage to recall the past and a stimulus to expectation regarding the future.\" Trevor Brook For years, nobody has been allowed inside the church From the outside, the towers and gothic exterior have earned the church the nickname of \"the cathedral\". Just a few black and white photos exist of the interior and, while none can enter, the building is kept at a constant temperature of 10C to help maintain its condition. The Catholic Apostolic Church was built in 1839 for Henry Drummond, a church sect who believed Victorian society was on the brink of collapse. Drummond, a banker and MP for West Surrey, helped to build up the church which was founded with 12 apostles.

There's a cold wind blowing from the  resund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in Helsing r, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts. This windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds. This year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April); Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take in Rupert Goold's production starring Luke Thallon (from 8 February).

        "content": "Mystery of medieval cemetery near airport runway deepens 23 April 2025 Share Save Rebecca Morelle, Science editor and Alison Francis, Senior science journalist Share Save Kevin Church/BBC The team has so far found 41 skeletons buried in the cemetery A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying. The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts. Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury. Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all the other people who were buried with great care. Kevin Church/BBC The skeleton of the woman found in the ditch is being analysed in the lab \"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project. About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated. So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female. \"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman. \"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\" Kevin Church/BBC Excavating the fragile bones is painstaking work The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features. \"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University. \"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\" Kevin Church/BBC Delicate fragments of imported glass have been found close to the graves Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were. Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead. \"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman. \"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\" The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west. The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal. They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her. Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s. Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful. Kevin Church/BBC Teeth can reveal more about what this medieval community was eating Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis. The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too. Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related. The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth. Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death. \"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population. \"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\" Kevin Church/BBC Half the site has been excavated by so far The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery. Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up. \"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said. \"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\" But for the moment there are still many contradictions that remain unsolved.",

        "content": "Hidden castle reveals swords, spooks and screen stars 20 April 2025 Share Save Federica Bedendo, BBC News, North East and Cumbria and Andrew Carter, BBC Sounds Share Save BBC Cockermouth Castle is visible from a footpath along the River Derwent - but not all of it There is a castle right in the middle of a town popular with visitors and day trippers, yet if you blink you may miss it. Dating to the 12th century, its ruined outer walls make it hard to believe someone actually lives here. But John Max Henry Scawen Wyndham - or Lord Egremont - and his wife Caroline, tell us they spend increasingly more time in their hidden gem on the edge of the Lake District. Recalling the first time she visited the castle, Lady Egremont says: \"It was a rather magical experience coming through the 12th century gatehouse and finding yourself in this courtyard with this quite modest house in the middle of a ruin. \"I thought it was the most charming and romantic place, because you look down from above to the River Derwent which is flowing below. \"It has these beautiful views.\" A house was built within the walls in the early 1800s The house Lady Egremont refers to was built in the early 1800s, but it was Lord Egremont's mother, Pamela, who made it a cosy residence after the death of her husband John in 1972, when she increasingly split her time between Cumbria and London. \"She made it so much nicer,\" says Lord Egremont. \"It was a rather dingy place before then, but she made it partly her home.\" Crosby steals a catch The castle is home to many artefacts and its archives include old maps and documents dating as far back as the 1300s. As simple a task as having a clear-out can reveal some long-forgotten items with a significant history. Lady Egremont recalls one such instance, after the death of her mother-in-law in 2013, when she was clearing a \"cellar-type room\". \"Underneath a pile of horsehair matrasses, that must have been there for 100 years, I found a long wooden box - it clearly hadn't been opened for a long long time, with rusty locks. \"I prised it open and inside there was a sword which General Wyndham, who fought at the battle of Waterloo, had captured from a French soldier.\" Ivor Nicholas An image of Bing Crosby during a trip to Cumbria, captured by local photographer Ivor Nicholas Among the artwork around the property hangs a picture that somewhat stands out from the rest - a photograph of screen legend Bing Crosby. The American singer and actor is portrayed wearing waders and holding a fishing rod and a large salmon. Lord Egremont says: \"He came up here, that was in my father's days. He wrote a little song, I remember, when he was on the riverbanks on the Derwent.\" The song, he added, was about the fish not biting and the struggle to catch one. Nosey ghost The presence of the past is not just felt through old actors and ancient history, according to the couple who split their time between Cockermouth and Sussex. Lord Egremont says: \"Well, there is a story of a ghost and I'm sure I've heard this ghost. \"It's not frightening, I've never been alarmed by it. \"You hear it sometimes in the passage at night. It's got a quite heavy footfall and it sometimes turns the handles of doors to see if anybody's in the room.\" Lord and Lady Egremont believe a ghost walks the corridors of the castle Lady Egremont says she has also witnessed this, and so had her mother-in-law. \"We really think of it as a kindly presence,\" adds Lord Egremont. Cockermouth Castle cannot be opened to the public because of health and safety concerns Once a year, during the Cockermouth Live music festival held at venues around the town, a stage is hosted in the courtyard of the castle, giving visitors a rare glimpse. But due to health and safety concerns, the building cannot be opened to the public. \"The ruins are too precarious for people to walk on,\" says Lord Egremont. \"I quite often very nearly slip on the wet steps myself. \"I'm of a certain age so I have to be quite careful and there is also the question of getting in and out of the ruins. \"It's not a very big doorway and every now and again there is an embarrassment when a person of a certain size gets stuck.\" 'Raging torrent' One real threat to the castle is represented by the River Derwent, which it overlooks from atop a small mound. After Storm Desmond in 2015, when Cockermouth itself went underwater during devastating floods, the castle was \"very nearly lost\", says Lord Egremont. \"The Derwent was like a raging torrent and it rose up right to the foundations and to the banks where the walls rest.\" Storm Desmond threatened the older part of the castle Lorries carried stone sent from a quarry in Barnard Castle to provide the material for the emergency repairs to prop up the structure. Lord Egremont adds: \"We felt absolutely horrified because, to lose it, it would be a great tragedy for my family and the community, because it's such a landmark.\" Follow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.",

        "content": "'I found 11th Century coins months into my career' 20 April 2025 Share Save Alice Cunningham BBC News, Suffolk Share Save BBC Andrew Pegg, from Leiston, Suffolk, retrained as an archaeologist before unearthing a hoard of 11th Century coins near the town A man who found a hoard of 11th Century coins just months into his archaeology career said the discovery was made all the more sweet by being unearthed near his home town. Andrew Pegg, 49, from Leiston, Suffolk, spent 24 years working in the retail industry before he felt he needed a change. He enjoyed metal detecting and heard about an open traineeship to become a qualified archaeologist. After completing this, he then joined an Oxford Cotswold Archaeology excavation at Sizewell C - just outside his home town - where he found 321 silver coins in mint condition. Contributed Mr Pegg's traineeship involved a lot of fieldwork as well as some GPS survey work For years, Mr Pegg had managed a Leiston hardware store, but he said his career there did not offer a lot of \"variety\". In 2022, a friend who worked at Cotswold Archaeology invited him to a community excavation. He enjoyed metal detecting in his spare time in the local area and wondered if the dig could be \"a foot in the door\" to the archaeology world. After this, Mr Pegg heard about an open traineeship to become an archaeologist with Cotswold Archaeology and he \"took the jump\" to apply. He completed it to become a qualified archaeologist and has recently been promoted. \"As long as you've got the interest for it, and you're prepared to put up with the weather conditions sometimes, as long as you've got the passion for it, I think the majority of people are fine and have that capability to progress,\" Mr Pegg said of the work. Oxford Cotswold Archaeology The discovery of the coins featured on the 12th series of BBC show Digging for Britain The first major project Mr Pegg worked on was excavations at Sizewell C, led by a partnership between Oxford Archaeology and Cotswold Archaeology. About nine months after starting, he found the hoard of 11th Century coins, which the team believed could have been the savings pot of a local figure, fearing regime changes following the coronation of Edward the Confessor. The coins date between 1036 and 1044 during the reigns of Harold I, Harthacnut and Edward the Confessor. Mr Pegg said none of the team \"expected anything like that\" to be found at the site and it was an \"incredible\" surprise. \"It's my backyard - I was born in Leiston and I've never lived anywhere else,\" he added. \"I think there was some kind of fate involved in that... to find it where you live, where you grew up, we've never done archaeology on this kind of scale in the immediate area of Leiston before and to find something like that is mind blowing really.\" Oxford Cotswold Archaeology The coins were found in a lead package which was nicknamed \"the pasty\" by the archaeology team because of its shape Mr Pegg is now working on excavations in Wickham Market, Suffolk, and encouraged anyone thinking of a career change into archaeology to take the plunge. \"It's not just the folk out of college and university with their varying degrees, they took me on at 47 - quite late in life - and I had no archaeological background at all,\" he said. \"I know there's a couple of my other colleagues have gone down a similar route so it's not that niche. \"There is quite an open audience as to who can do this job, it's not a closed book by any means. \"You just need to have the interest and passion for it.\" Follow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "content": "The forgotten Indian explorer who uncovered an ancient civilisation 19 April 2025 Share Save Cherylann Mollan BBC News, Mumbai Share Save Alamy Rakhaldas Banerjee is credited with making one of the most important discoveries in world history An Indian archaeologist, whose career was marked by brilliance and controversy, made one of the world's greatest historical discoveries. Yet he remains largely forgotten today. In the early 1900s, Rakhaldas Banerjee (also spelled Banerji) unearthed Mohenjo-daro - meaning \"mound of the dead men\" in the Sindhi language - in present-day Pakistan. It was the largest city of the thriving Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilisation, which stretched from north-east Afghanistan to north-west India during the Bronze Age. Banerjee, an intrepid explorer and talented epigraphist, worked for the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) when the country was under British colonial rule. He spent months travelling to distant corners of the subcontinent, looking for ancient artefacts, ruins and scripts. But while his discovery of Mohenjo-daro was ground-breaking, Banerjee's legacy is clouded by disputes. His independent streak and defiance of colonial protocols often landed him in trouble - tainting his reputation and perhaps even erasing parts of his contribution from global memory. Getty Images The ruins of Mohenjo-daro in Sindh in present-day Pakistan Interestingly, Banerjee's reports on Mohenjo-daro were never published by the ASI. Archaeologist PK Mishra later accused then ASI chief John Marshall of suppressing Banerjee's findings and claiming credit for the discovery himself. \"The world knows Marshall discovered the civilisation's ruins and it is taught in institutions. Banerjee is an insignificant footnote,\" Prof Mishra told the Times of India newspaper. In her book, Finding Forgotten Cities: How the Indus Civilization Was Discovered, historian Nayanjot Lahiri writes that Banerjee \"lacked diplomacy and tact and displayed a high-handedness that ruffled feathers\". Her book also sheds light on the controversies he was embroiled in during his time at the ASI. She notes how once, he attempted to procure inscriptions and images from a museum in north-east India without the approval or knowledge of his boss. Another time, Banerjee attempted to relocate some stone sculptures from a museum in Bengal to the one he was stationed at without the necessary permissions. In another instance, he purchased an antique painting for a sum without consulting his superiors who thought he'd paid more than was necessary. \"Banerjee's many talents seemed to include being always able to rub people the wrong way,\" Lahiri writes. Getty Images An excavation site at Harappa in the Punjab province in present-day Pakistan But Banerjee remains a prominent figure among world historians and scholars in Bengal because of his connection with Mohenjo-daro. He was born in 1885 to a wealthy family in Bengal. The medieval monuments that dotted Baharampur, the city he grew up in, kindled his interest in history and he pursued the subject in college. But he always had an adventurous streak. Once, when he was tasked with writing an essay about the Scythian period of Indian history, he travelled to a museum in a neighbouring state to study first-hand sculptures and scripts from that era. In her book, The Life and Works of Rakhaldas Banerji, author Yama Pande notes how Banerjee joined the ASI as an excavation assistant in 1910 and rose quickly within the ranks to become a superintending archaeologist in western India in 1917. It was in this post that he first set eyes on Mohenjo-daro in Sindh in 1919. In the following years, he conducted a series of excavations at the site that revealed some of the most fascinating finds: ancient Buddhist stupas, coins, seals, pots and microliths. Between 1922 and 1923, he discovered several layers of ruins that held clues about various urban settlements that had emerged in the region, but most importantly, the oldest one that had existed some 5,300 years ago - the Indus Valley Civilisation. At that time, historians had not yet discovered the full scale of the Indus Civilisation which, we now know, covered an expanse of approximately 386,000 sq miles (999,735 sq km) along the Indus river valley. Three seals from Banerjee's excavation bore images and scripts similar to those from Harappa in the Punjab province in present-day Pakistan. This helped establish a link between the two sites, shedding light on the vast reach of the Indus Valley civilisation. Getty Images A seal recovered from Mohenjo-daro",

        "content": "Britain in the 1960s was captivated by the daring of the Great Train Robbery, and the sheer scale of the money stolen. But when the accused men stood trial in April 1964, the judge was determined to send a message that such crimes would not be tolerated. Fourteen years later, several of the convicts talked to the BBC. On 16 April 1964, Robert Welch was one of the 12 men found guilty of a notorious heist in Aylesbury Crown Court. Fourteen years later, in 1978, he was on the BBC's documentary and current affairs programme, Man Alive, and recalled seeing local dignitaries jostle for positions in the courtroom to hear the sentencing. \"This was what they had all come to watch. The climax of the play, the drama,\" Welch said. \"And the medieval setting in which we were sentenced, you know, it was a bit chilling.\" Welch and his fellow convicts had fallen a long way since pulling off one of the most audacious and lucrative thefts the UK had ever seen: the Great Train Robbery. WATCH: The daring heist and huge sum of money captivated the British public. Welch and his co-defendants were part of a band who held up a Royal Mail night train travelling from Glasgow to London. The robbers had made off with  2.6m in used banknotes, a record haul at that time, and the equivalent of over  50m ($65.8m) today. At the time of Welch's trial, police were still hunting for three of the people they suspected had been involved in the crime.",

        "content": "Three of the B-52 crew who managed to eject landed in the Mediterranean several miles off the coast and were rescued by local fishing boats within an hour of the accident. The fourth, the B-52 radar-navigator, ejected through the plane's explosion, which left him badly burned, and was unable to separate himself from his ejection seat. Despite this, he managed to open his parachute and was found alive near the village and taken to hospital. However, this still left the problem of locating the plane's deadly nuclear payload. \"My main concern was to recover those bombs, that was number-one priority,\" Gen Wilson told the BBC in 1968. One of our nuclear bombs is missing \"The first night, the Guardia Civil [the Spanish national police force] had come to the little bar in Palomares, and that was about the only place that had electricity. And they had reported what they considered to be a bomb, so we immediately despatched some of our people to this riverbed which is not far from the centre of town, and, in fact, it was a bomb, so we placed a guard on that. And then the next morning, at first daylight, we started conducting our search, and I believe it was something in the order of 10am or 11am the following morning, we located two other bombs.\" This accounted for three of the nuclear bombs, but there was still one missing. By the next day, trucks filled with US troops had been sent from nearby bases, with the beach in Palomares becoming a base for some 700 US airmen and scientists urgently trying to contain any radioactive contamination and locate the fourth warhead. \"The first thing that you could see as the search really got underway in earnest was Air Force personnel linking up hand-by-hand and 40 or 50 people in a line. They would have designated search areas. There were some people with Geiger counters who started arriving, and so they started marking off the areas which were contaminated,\" said Capt Ramirez in 2011. When US personnel registered an area contaminated with radiation, they would scrape up the first three inches of topsoil and seal it in barrels to be shipped back to the US. Some 1,400 tonnes of irradiated soil ended up being sent to a storage facility in South Carolina.",

British-led French SAS soldiers were dropped into the German-occupied eastern Netherlands on 7 and 8 April 1945, suffering 18% casualties in fierce fighting. The men were tasked with creating mayhem until the First Canadian Army pushed north to meet them and liberate the last part of the country under occupation. RAF Rivenhall expert Chris Bullock said Operation Amherst was the first time parachutists were dropped above cloud cover. Getty Images The French paratroopers were led by the British army's Brig Mike Calvert during the Dutch operation. Here he inspects them as they mark their transfer from British command to the French army The mission utilised an RAF navigation system not previously used with \"live loads\". \"It was called Gee and it's basically a transponder that picks up signals from different transmitters to plot where they are,\" he said. Previously, it had been used only for dropping cargo or for co-ordinating aircraft attacks on specific locations. Mr Bullock said there was \"0% visibility\" due to heavy clouds, so the 702 paratroopers from 3rd and 4th Battalions were dropped from a far greater height than planned. Getty Images British Army XXX Corps troops in February 1945, before the liberation, ferrying Canadian soldiers through Dutch streets flooded by the Germans Mr Bullock, who served with 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment for 25 years, lives near Rivenhall and has been researching its wartime history for more than 10 years. He said: \"The fact is they didn't know how to get that many paratroopers into the aircraft at one time with all their equipment, and the RAF crews were trying to figure it all out on the night.\" The British-planned operation involved 47 aircraft taking off from two other Essex airfields, Great Dunmow and Earls Colne, as well as from Shepherds Grove in Suffolk. Halifax bombers from Earls Colne were large enough to carry Jeeps, which were also dropped into the Netherlands. Getty Images Dutch people celebrated Liberation Day in May 1945, marking the end of five years of occupation The country had been occupied since May 1940, but by this stage of the war parts of the country had been liberated. But the Dutch had suffered through the Hunger Winter as a result of the German decision to stop all food transports to the west of the country   20,000 people died of starvation   as well as exceptionally cold conditions, while many thousands were displaced. \"The objective of Amherst was to disrupt the German rear lines so the Canadian Second Army, advancing from the south, could relive them within 48 hours,\" said Mr Bullock. Some of the highly-experienced British-trained men fought on for up to six days in the northern province of Drenthe before they could be relieved. \"This is why the casualties were exceptionally high   28 were killed, 39 were wounded and 57 were missing in action,\" he said. But their objective was achieved and, less than a month later, Victory in Europe was declared.",

The hike begins early in the morning at Mount Nebo, a sacred mountain 610m above sea level in Jordan. On a clear day, panoramic views of the Dead Sea, Bethlehem and Jerusalem stretch across the horizon. According to the Bible, it is the last place Moses gazed upon before his death. Today, it's the first sight walkers see as they set out on their journey along the Camino de Egeria, a pilgrim route first taken by a 4th-Century nun. The view is \"magical\", says Silvano Mezzenzana, who recently undertook the three-day hike. He recalls standing atop that peak on the Moab plateau, a dry Sun fanning out over the ridges and farmland beneath, noting that it is fascinating both in the morning when the Sun lights up the Palestinian bank and the city of Jericho, and in the afternoon when the sunset draws the silhouettes of the hills of Judah up to Jerusalem. Up there, \"you do not realise that you are on a mountain\", he adds. Beginning on the eastern edge of the Great Rift Valley, the 50km route winds through farmland and rugged hills   a voyage that is far greener than its European equivalent, the 800km Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail undertaken by around 500,000 people each year. Following the January announcement from Jordan and Spain of a merger twinning the Camino de Egeria with the Camino de Santiago to boost their respective cultural heritage, locals hope that the newly-renovated Middle Eastern trail can become a similar phenomenon. The goal is to highlight the significance of the eponymous Egeria, the Spanish nun believed to have travelled by donkey from Jordan through Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Asia Minor to visit the holy places recounted in the Bible. She is thought to be the first woman to make the journey, which pre-dates the famed Camino de Santiago by five centuries. The hike is typically split up into three days (though can be done as quickly as in two, or a leisurely five). The terrain is not particularly challenging, but the distance   of around 17km per day   makes the hike unsuitable for total novices. Last year, wide paths were fixed between the rocky valleys and hills along much of the route, ushering in what the Ministry of Tourism hopes will mark a new era for international interest in the country.",

        "content": "When Henry VIII brought the big guns to town 30 March 2025 Share Save Paul Johnson and Sally Fairfax BBC News Share Save Getty Images Deal Castle in Kent was built for Henry VIII in 1540. Similar fortifications were constructed in Hull at about the same time Today, it is dominated by the bold, modern contours of The Deep aquarium. But step back almost 500 years, and the mouth of the River Hull was overlooked by a very different sort of structure. The South Blockhouse   part of a series of castles and fortifications ordered by Henry VIII   had \"enormously thick\" brick walls and was bristling with cannon. It was built to protect the port from hostile ships making their way up the Humber and into the harbour. The ruins of the defences, which were later known as the Citadel, before being torn down in the 19th Century, now lie under a coach park near The Deep. And the blockhouse has made headlines in recent months due to wrangles over long-running plans to recreate a part of it as a new visitor attraction. Why did Henry VIII bring the big guns to Hull? The topic is being explored as part of the Hidden East Yorkshire Podcast. Last month, planning permission was granted to build wire-mesh structures on the site to give an impression of the scale and shape of the blockhouse. But doubts remain over the viability of the new attraction because of a shortfall in funding. So why is the site so important to the history of Hull? Ken Steedman, a project manager at Humber Field Archaeology, has been investigating the blockhouse for more than 25 years and says the site reinforces Hull's status as an important town during the Tudor era. \"Henry did a lot of his defensive works on the south coast, so this was very much further north than most of the significant other structures. \"He came to Hull on a visit in 1540 and again in 1541. He established that there was a weakness here. \"Hull's medieval walls only surrounded three sides, because the River Hull was the port. \"The only defensive measure they had up to then was a chain across the mouth of the Hull to stop enemy ships coming in.\" Humber Field Archaeology A cannon discovered in the ruins of the blockhouse Henry ordered the construction of two blockhouses and a large castle in the middle, all built of brick. Brick kilns established on the site nearby to produce materials, while stone was taken from Meaux Abbey, near Wawne, and shipped down the river, at a time when Henry was forcibly closing monasteries. It would have been used to build doorways or broken up to form the core of the walls. The South Blockhouse was formed of three \"petalled lobes\", shaped like a club playing card, says Ken. \"We're talking about a wall several metres thick, which would have had gun ports in them for cannon to fire through. \"It had two floors and a roof that would have had a cannon on as well. \"What we see now is just the remains of the ground floor. It still has the surviving floors, several feet lower than the top of the walls as they stand. \"The walls were reduced to the current level during the demolition of the Citadel in the 1860s.\" Humber Field Archaeology Thick walls lie under a coach park and have been excavated on several occasions The site was unearthed during a series of digs, beginning in 1997. For Ken, it was a \"very exciting\" discovery. \"With The Deep being planned and constructed, we knew that the access road would cut across where we thought the blockhouse and some of the Citadel walls would be,\" he says. \"As part of the proposal we did some trial excavations and we found that the survival of the early structure was incredible.\" Protections were put in place to ensure the site did not get built on and during the City of Culture year, the line of the walls was painted on to the car park. \"We had open days and the response from the public was enormous, incredible,\" he adds. Hull City Council Planning permission has been granted for a visitor attraction on the site, but funding has yet to be secured That level of interest has been sustained by projects such as When Cannons Were Roaring, a play performed by actors at the Northern Academy of Performing Arts in Hull, who were commissioned to bring to life the story of how Henry commanded the defences to be built. It is now hoped that a visitor attraction on the site will help educate a new generation of residents and visitors about the history of the city. Ken says the council is exploring options to find funding. He adds: \"We spend so much of our time online and you can look at three-dimensional representations, but actually being on the site, seeing something connected to the past, is far more effective than reading it in a book or seeing it on a screen.\" Listen to more podcasts from the Hidden East Yorkshire series.

        "content": "Archaeologists find 'unprecedented' Iron Age hoard 25 March 2025 Share Save Jessica Bradley BBC News, Yorkshire Share Save Durham University Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University said the size and scale of the hoard is \"exceptional\" Archaeologists have helped uncover one of the \"largest and most important\" Iron Age finds in the UK. The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University. It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago. Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time. Durham University The site was discovered in December 2021 by metal detectorist Peter Heads After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a  120,000 grant from Historic England. Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth. Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\". He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought. \"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said. \"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\" It is thought the objects may have been burnt on a funerary pyre before being buried, though no human remains were found. Durham University A cauldron was found buried upside down with a large stone crushing the centre inwards Analysis: Danny Savage, BBC News In the archaeology labs at Durham University there's a real buzz about the unveiling of the Melsonby Hoard. Curators feel this is the discovery of a lifetime. Hundreds of recovered artefacts are spread out in a climate controlled room on long tables. You have to use your imagination a bit, Iron Age artefacts from 2,000 years ago have rusted or faded and are far from their original glory. Some of them were decorated with coral which has bleached over the centuries. But it's the story they tell that's extraordinary. Iron Age experts now have evidence that people 2,000 years ago had four wheel wagons as well as two wheel chariots. They now have proof that Iron Age residents of northern England had trading connections with the continent and the growing Roman Empire. This will keep experts busy for years. There's also a bit of secrecy too. The exact location of the discovery is not being revealed over concern that rogue treasure hunters will turn up at night and start looking for other artefacts. History is valuable - to different people in different ways. Durham University Experts from Durham University, The British Museum and Historic England were involved in the dig Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape. They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl. Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance. The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage. Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK. \"It sheds new light on Iron Age life in the north and Britain, but it also demonstrates connections with Europe.\" Durham University A copper alloy harness fitting decorated with coral, and held in place with tiny rivets, was among the items discovered The Yorkshire Museum has launched a fundraising campaign to secure the hoard for its collections. Andrew Woods, senior curator at the museum said: \"This Iron Age hoard is an unprecedented find in the north, which will help us to understand more about this remarkable period in our history. \"We have the exciting opportunity to save the hoard for the nation and the people of Yorkshire. \"By acquiring the hoard, we will be able to make it accessible to everyone and, working in partnership with others, we can learn more about this fascinating period, why the hoard was buried, how the objects may have been used and to cast light on to whom it may have belonged.\" A selection of objects from the hoard will be on display at the Yorkshire Museum from 25 March 2025.

        "content": "John Zada The SS Northwestern, a steamship destroyed in a WWII Japanese attack, still rises above the water's surface (Credit: John Zada) Within months of the Dutch Harbor attack, 145,000 US and Canadian soldiers were deployed to defend and retake the occupied Aleutians. They secured the islands with fortresses, artillery and bunkers, such one on Bunker Hill above Dutch Harbor, which is now the setting of a hike with stunning 360-degree views. A larger base overlooking Unalaska Bay and the Bering Sea a few miles away on nearby Mount Ballyhoo, known as Fort Schwatka, once featured 100 buildings and was built to withstand earthquakes and hurricane-force winds. Epic, harrowing battles were fought on bleak and difficult terrain. Thousands died on both sides of the conflict   many from exposure to the islands' harsh weather. By August 1943, the Japanese were expelled from the Aleutians, and over time, the battles that took place here have been largely forgotten. After the Japanese attacks, the US military ordered the mandatory evacuation of the Unangax  from the Aleutians for their safety and to prepare the island for arriving military forces. Residents were given less than a day's notice, allowed one suitcase each and weren't told where they were going or when they would return. In all, 881 Unangax  were expelled from nine villages across the archipelago and were interned at abandoned canneries in the temperate rainforests of south-eastern Alaska for three years. Many had never left their homeland before, let alone seen trees. Around 10% of the camps' population perished due to poor housing and sanitation conditions and limited access to health care. Those who returned to Unalaska in 1945 found their villages either looted or burned down. In the 1980s, the Unangax  sued for ill-treatment and deprivation of their rights in conjunction with Japanese Americans who were also interned during the war. In 1988, a restitution law was passed granting financial compensation and an apology to the Unangax  from both Congress and the President. Today, an etched stone slab Unalaska serves as is a memorial to that dark period. After World War Two, Unalaska became a hub of the US' commercial fishing industry, which still dominates the island today. Dutch Harbor is the US' top commercial fishing port by volume and the main delivery port featured on Discovery Channel's hit reality show, Deadliest Catch. Four hundred vessels from 14 countries make port here each year, catching several hundred million pounds of fish   around 10% of the entire US fishing industry. Halibut, salmon, herring and several varieties of crab are among the species caught in nearby waters.",

The Marlborough Mound is the second-largest Neolithic mound in Europe. Standing at 62ft (19m) and located in the grounds of Marlborough College, Wiltshire, it is rumoured to be the burial place of legendary wizard Merlin. The college has applied for permission to demolish some of its buildings, created in the 20th Century, which partially cut into the west side of the mound and replace them with structures to support the monument. It said the proposed work would provide an opportunity for archaeologists to carry out research. Marlborough College/Marlborough Mound Trust College buildings which partially cut into the mound could be demolished Celebrated throughout the history of the college, which was where Catherine, Princess of Wales, went to school, the mound has been carbon dated to 2,400BC. Only a few miles down the A4 is the ancient monument that beats it in size - Silbury Hill, part of the Avebury World Heritage Site. A 2024 archaeological assessment described the mound as \"nationally important\" and explained it is a prehistoric monument, has part of a medieval castle and also some 17th and 18th Century garden features. Marlborough College/Pete Davies Photography The mound also has a grotto It said that while it is unlikely anything archaeologically significant would be found under the buildings, removing them would enable archaeologists to investigate a cross-section of the mound. In the planning application, it also mentions that the changes would make the monument more \"visually pleasing\". A wall is planned as well, to ensure that the mound does not slip. The application adds: \"The structures will be demolished slowly with an archaeologist presence during the process.\" Marlborough College There are plans for a small pavilion to house information on the Marlborough Mound The college already has permission to convert a garden pavilion in its grounds into a small visitor information facility, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The mound has its own trust - the Marlborough Mound Trust - which the work would be carried out on behalf of. The trust was set up to preserve the monument and tell the public about it. Opportunities to see the mound are limited to certain open days and pre-arrangement as not only is it in a school, there are risks to conservation and the spiral path to the top is not designed for heavy use.

Thousands of women came to the UK to run clubs for the US forces, yet \"we really hadn't delved into their lives and personal stories,\" said historian Hattie Hearn. The Imperial War Museum project began in January with the names of 100 women and has added more than 400 to that list so far. Dr Hearn, from the museum at Duxford, Cambridgeshire, hopes families will contribute memories, photographs and memorabilia \"to preserve this history before it's lost\". Getty Images Clubs were set up in cities like London (above) and in large towns around the UK to offer the Americans \"a place to escape to\", said Dr Hearn \"Their stories have largely been forgotten, so the aim is to bring them to life, to learn more about these women and the impact they had, not only on the morale of the Americans based here, but also on the local British people who came in contact with them,\" she added. \"We particularly hadn't done any research around the lives of the black American women who served with the American Red Cross.\" IWM/Roger Freeman Collection A World War Two innovation was the clubmobile, converted buses which toured the US airfields, and were named after US states The American Red Cross was a civilian organisation set up in the 19th Century which became involved in supporting the welfare of service personnel. During World War One, it was sent to the UK to set up service clubs for US forces and performed the same role during World War Two. East Anglia, with its airfields, was a particular hub, with clubs at Norwich, Ipswich and Sudbury in Suffolk, as well as smaller towns like Royston, Hertfordshire. Dr Hearn, who is the curator of the American Air Museum, said: \"Hundreds of thousands of Americans poured into the region to fly from these airfields - at its peak 500,000 Americans were serving here - and the American Red Cross expanded at an equally fast rate.\" Getty Images These women ran the American Red Cross Club on Great George Street, Bristol - a segregated club for black servicemen only and the first of its kind in Britain US society was divided by racial segregation - black people were denied equal rights under the \"Jim Crow\" laws, which remained in place in the southern states until the 1960s. While the organisation did not have an official policy of segregation, unlike the US forces, in practice \"only black Americans went to black clubs\", said Dr Hearn. \"The American Red Cross employed British women, including Elizabeth Berwick, whose parents were from the Caribbean,\" she said, about one of the first stories unearthed by the project's four volunteers. \"Her marriage to York Batley, a supply sergeant from a segregated Engineer Aviation Battalion, made the news in the US and she is believed to be the first British woman to marry a black American in the UK.\" American military policy was to uphold segregation and forbid the marriages of black Americans and white British women - but as Elizabeth Berwick was black, \"that made the marriage more acceptable\". IWM/Roger Freeman Collection Dr Hearn has yet to find out exactly how many American women came to the UK during the war to work for the organisation Another rediscovered story was that of Hazel Dixon Payne, who was studying for her PhD when she became an early recruit to the American Red Cross. She was the first black woman to travel to Alaska with the organisation, where the Army Corps of Engineers was sent to build the Alcan Highway in 1942, said Dr Hearn. On arrival in London in July 1944, she became a field director, but died on 11 October after minor surgery, \"becoming the first black American Red Cross volunteer to die in overseas service\". \"She was buried in England with full military honours, there was an outpouring of grief at the time and Lady Nancy Astor [the American-born first woman MP] even sent a letter of commendation to Hazel's mother,\" said Dr Hearn. Mrs Dixon Payne's name will now be added to the museum's roll of honour. Getty Images The mobile services were also segregated, with black crews like those of the Massachusetts (above) supporting the Aviation Engineering Battalions A World War Two innovation was the clubmobile service, which were travelling service clubs that visited airfields at least once a week. Dr Hearn said: \"London Green Line buses were initially requisitioned, kitted out with doughnut-making and coffee machines, with lounges in the back, offering what they called a taste of home, and most importantly, offering airmen the chance to talk to American women.\" The crew of Clubmobile Massachusetts were among 43 black women working in Britain with the American Red Cross in early 1943. They visited many of Suffolk's airfields, including RAF Debach, near Woodbridge, where the Aviation Engineering Battalions were building US airbases through until 1944. The Imperial War Museum The project will also look at the impact of the American Red Cross on Britons and their allies, as well as their support for US forces, said Dr Hearn Clarice Brooks was the crew captain, alongside Pericles McDuffie and Camille Jones. Miss Jones later became the director of a club in Basingstoke, Hampshire, but resigned from the organisation after she witnessed a black American soldier being attacked by three white Americans while escorting a British woman home. \"The victim, Lt Jeffers, was charged with assault - Camille said, 'I see us fighting fascists but not fascist principles, for in our midst we continue to harbour doctrines of racial supremacy which belie the cause for which we are fighting',\" said Dr Hearn. She added that the stories revealed so far were \"just the tip of the iceberg\" in a project expected to last into next year. It hopes to attract more volunteers, including from the United States.

The denarii date from the late Roman Republic to the reign of Marcus Aurelius and his wife Faustina, and were found at Barton Bendish, Norfolk. Coin specialist Adrian Marsden said the loss might have been the equivalent of \"a few hundred quid\" to its owner. The hoard is the subject of a treasure inquest and King's Lynn Museum is hoping to acquire it. Andrew Williams/Norfolk County Council Empress Faustina accompanied her husband Marcus Aurelius on campaigns and after her death he ordered she should be deified \"There's 200 years' worth of coins in the hoard, which is what you get with a stable currency,\" Dr Marsden, from the Norfolk Historic Environment Service, said. \"It's similar to the 1960s when you'd still get Victorian pennies in your change, although they were practically worn smooth.\" The earliest coin in the hoard dates from 57BC and is also the most worn. It was made in the Roman Republic which lasted from 509BC, when a monarch was replaced by elected magistrates, until 27BC, when the empire began. Andrew Williams/Norfolk County Council The earliest coin shows Caius Serveilius (top row), while the lower denarii shows the emperor Hadrian, who ordered the building of the wall in northern Britain The rest of the coins show six emperors and two of their wives, with the most recent denarii dating to AD175-6. Dr Marsden said it was impossible to know if the coins were a purse loss or had been deliberately hidden \"which is simply what you do when you haven't got banks\". \"We do know that this part of Norfolk, the area on the fen edge around King's Lynn, was a very prosperous part of Britain - there was a line of villas here and you've got [the county's longest Roman road] the Peddars Way - because the soil is very fertile and it's prime agricultural land,\" he said. \"While it's always very difficult to tie in coins with prices today, because the structure of society was so very different, the loss was probably worth the equivalent of a few hundred quid to its owner.\" Andrew Williams/Norfolk County Council Emperor Vespasian (AD69 to 79) was the last of the emperors in the \"year of four emperors \" and went on to found a new dynasty Follow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

She was about 5ft 6in tall (1.7m). Dating to approximately 343 to 1 BC they are more than 2000 years old, and from the prehistoric period known as the Iron Age.

Curator of archaeology at National Museums NI (NMNI), Niamh Baker, told BBC News NI the discovery of the remains was \"very significant\". \"There was evidence of cut marks on the neck vertebrae,\" she said. Ms Baker said it showed \"that the individual had been intentionally decapitated at the bog\". During the discovery in 2023, no skull was recovered with the remains. \"It was likely that that was taken away at the time, during the Iron Age,\" Ms Baker added. \"Perhaps it is part of a pattern of ritual killings and sacrifice...there is a pattern of that across North-West Europe and Ireland.\" Niamh Baker says marks on the body show evidence of decapitation QUB professor of archaeology Eileen Murphy carried out an assessment of the body. She said the young woman's fate was not untypical of finds from the era. \"As is the case for so many Iron Age bog bodies, the young woman suffered a highly violent death which involved the flow of blood from her throat followed by decapitation,\" she said. \"The head was taken away, but the body was left where it fell only to be discovered by machine workers some 2,000 years later.\" PSNI The ancient remains were discovered on Bellaghy peatland Ms Baker said more research would now be carried out on the remains, to provide more clues about how people lived during the Iron Age. \"We'll hopefully find out information potentially about her diet, potentially about her movement,\" she said. \"That will be able to determine information about who she was, perhaps what population she was part of. \"There's very little evidence that tells us about everyday life during the Iron Age. \"What has survived are high-quality, prestige artefacts and objects that tell us that during this time there was a social elite. Some woven fabric, made of plant material, was found with the body and may go on display in the future. 'Treating remains respectfully' Navan Fort in County Armagh is the best known Iron Age settlement in Northern Ireland. Photos of the remains were released by the PSNI shortly after they were discovered, but they are unlikely to go on public display in the Ulster Museum. That is because, according to NMNI's head of curatorial, Hannah Crowdy, museums have to \"think very carefully\" about the human remains they hold and how to treat them respectfully. \"The nature of death of this individual was that she was decapitated and obviously that means the remains are in a certain condition that might be distressing for people to see,\" she said. \"There has to be a really strong argument for displaying them, we would never want to display them for sensational purposes.\" \"We think we can do a really compelling, really interesting display to help people understand the processes and to tell this young woman's story without showing her remains to the public.\" That could include artist's impressions of how the young woman appeared when she was alive. Hannah Crowdy says consultations are also in place regarding Takabuti being displayed",

        "content": "Last undiscovered tomb of Tutankhamun dynasty found 19 February 2025 Share Save Frances Mao BBC News Share Save Watch: Egyptologists discover the the tomb of King Thutmose II Archaeologists have found the last undiscovered royal tomb of the 18th Egyptian dynasty, which included the famous pharoah Tutankhamun. The uncovering of King Thutmose II's tomb marks the first time a pharoah's tomb has been found by a British-led excavation since Tutankhamun's was found over a century ago. The British-Egyptian team located it in the Western Valleys of the Theban Necropolis near the city of Luxor. Researchers had thought the burial chambers of the 18th dynasty pharaohs were more than 2km away, closer to the Valley of the Kings. New Kingdom Research Foundation The entrance to the tomb of King Thutmose II, who ruled three-and-a-half thousand years ago The crew found it in an area associated with the resting places of royal women, but when they got into the burial chamber they found it to be decorated - the sign of a pharaoh. \"Part of the ceiling was still intact: a blue-painted ceiling with yellow stars on it. And blue-painted ceilings with yellow stars are only found in kings' tombs,\" said the field director of the mission Piers Litherland. He told the BBC's Newshour programme he felt overwhelmed in the moment. \"The emotion of getting into these things is just one of extraordinary bewilderment because when you come across something you're not expecting to find, it's emotionally extremely turbulent really,\" he said. \"And when I came out, my wife was waiting outside and the only thing I could do was burst into tears.\" Mr Litherland, an honourary research associate with the University of Cambridge's archaeology department, said the discovery solved the mystery of where the tombs of early 18th dynasty kings are located. Researchers found Thutmose II's mummified remains two centuries ago but its original burial site had never been located. Alamy The King Thutmose II mummy lies in the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization New Kingdom Research Foundation The location and entry to the royal tomb of King Thutmose II who ruled three-and-a-half thousand years ago Thutmose II, whose reign is believed to have been from about 1493 to 1479 BC, was an ancestor of Tutankhamun. Tutankhamun's tomb was found by British archaeologists in 1922. Thutmose II is best known for being the husband of Queen Hatshepsut, regarded as one of Egypt's greatest pharaohs and one of the few female pharaohs who ruled in her own right. Mr Litherland said the \"large staircase and a very large descending corridor\" of the tomb suggested grandeur. \"It took us a very long time to get through all that,\" he said, noting it was blocked by flood debris and the ceilings had collapsed. \"It was only after crawling through a 10m (32ft) passageway that had a small 40cm gap at the top that we got into the burial chamber.\" There they discovered the blue ceiling and decorations of scenes from the Amduat, a religious text which was reserved for kings. That was another key sign they had found a king's tomb, Mr Litherland said. They set to work clearing the debris - expecting that they would find the crushed remains of a burial underneath. But \"the tomb turned out to be completely empty\", said Mr Litherland. \"Not because it was robbed but because it had been deliberately emptied.\" They then worked out that the tomb had been flooded - \"it had been built underneath a waterfall\" - just a few years after the king's burial and the contents moved to another location in ancient times. It was through sifting through tonnes of limestone in the chamber that they found fragments of alabaster jars, which bore the inscriptions of the names of Thutmose II and Hatshepsut. These fragments of alabaster \"had probably broken when the tomb was being moved,\" said Mr Litherland. \"And thank goodness they actually did break one or two things because that's how we found out whose tomb it was.\" New Kingdom Research Foundation The team, from the New Kingdom Research Foundation and Egypt's Antiquities Ministry, who found the tomb",

        "title": "'He meant a great deal to me and my people': How the assassination of Malcolm X shook the US 60 years ago",
        "content": "US black nationalist leader Malcolm X was assassinated on 21 February 1965, at the age of 39. The BBC reported on the reaction in his adopted home of Harlem, New York, as thousands of people queued to pay their last respects. At a time when black civil rights leaders were preaching peaceful integration, Malcolm X's uncompromising vision of black separatism inspired many people, while terrifying others. He was murdered in February 1965, and a reporter for the BBC's Panorama, Michael Charlton, stated at his funeral that he \"spoke a vengeful message, as forthright and chilled as the winter morning they buried him\". Amid tight security, the many thousands of people who had filed past his body were searched by police as a precaution against bombings. \"To these people, he preached that if the white man didn't answer for the black man's frustration, he must answer for his fury,\" added Charlton. He was internationally famous for his incendiary rhetoric, yet he had been developing a new, more moderate worldview. Asked what the death of Malcolm X meant to him by Panorama, one clearly upset man who was in the queue said: \"It's a blow to every black person in the United States of America.\" A young man described him as a hero, saying: \"He stood out among all black people. He showed the white man where it was at.\" This interviewee was one of several people who feared that more violence would follow. \"Whoever did it, Muslims or whoever did it, there's going to be a whole lot of hurt,\" he predicted. One young woman said: \"I don't believe it. Why would they kill another black man?\" Another woman had no doubt who was responsible: \"The white power structure in America is behind it. They quickly capitalised on it by saying that one of his own kind did it, but they put it up to be done. They know they had more to gain by getting Malcolm X out of the way than they had to let him live.\" WATCH: 'He meant something to me. That's why I'm down here'. Malcolm X was shot dead on stage at a New York ballroom as he prepared to deliver a speech to his Organization of Afro-American Unity. His wife and children were in the audience. Three men convicted of his murder were all members of the Nation of Islam, the political and religious body that, a year earlier, Malcolm X had left amid acrimony. One of the men was caught while attempting to flee, and confessed to the murder, but the other two convictions resulted in a long-running miscarriage of justice campaign. In 2021, a New York state judge agreed, and their convictions were quashed. Both men were later fully exonerated after New York's attorney general found prosecutors had withheld evidence that, in all likelihood, would have cleared them of blame for the murder. Still a controversial figure 60 years after his death, Malcolm X remains to some the ultimate symbol of rage and resistance in the face of oppression. Born Malcolm Little in 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska, he was the son of a Baptist preacher. When Malcolm was six years old, his father was killed in what many believe was a deliberate racist attack by white supremacists, although nobody knows for sure if this was the case. The shock of his father being killed led his mother to have a mental breakdown, and Malcolm and his seven siblings were shipped out to foster homes. He fell into a life of crime, and in 1946 he was jailed for burglary. While in prison, he discovered a love of learning and self-improvement. There, he encountered the ideas of the Nation of Islam, a political and religious body that argued that equality for black Americans could only be achieved through black and white people living in separate states. Upon his release from prison in 1952, he formally changed his name to Malcolm X. It was a firm rejection of the surname that had been given to his family by the people who, generations earlier, had enslaved them. He toured the US, spreading the Nation of Islam's message, and discovered that he had the power and charisma to inspire people with his words. Public speaking was a skill he had learnt, having entered prison as a middle-school dropout who, he admitted, \"didn't know a verb from a house\". He was not afraid to use shock tactics to get his message across, condemning white people as the \"white devil\" for the historic oppression of black people. When US President John F Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, he said it was \"chickens coming home to roost\".",

Several parts of Newhaven Fort, including tunnels leading to gunning positions and the battery observation post, have been made safe to explore. The casemates   vaults within the 154-year-old site   have also been revamped to stop them leaking. The 19th Century fort was closed for 12 months, but has reopened. Collections custodian Francis Pulham said the restoration had \"revitalised\" the fort. \"We have brand new exhibitions in pretty much every casemate and we've even been able to open parts of the fort which have never been open to the public before,\" he said. \"The restoration was pretty vital. There were areas that were no longer accessible due to safety concerns, there was a risk of losing some of our heritage buildings.\" He added: \"It is the most important military structure on the Sussex coast.\" George Carden/BBC In 1940, nine bombs were dropped on Newhaven Fort, with four hitting the target Mr Pulham said the restored battery observation post, which provides a panoramic view, was one of the most important rooms in defending Newhaven. Officers and soldiers used special range finders to look out for enemy ships and aircraft, he said. \"All that information was fed to the four guns above,\" he added. George Carden/BBC The restored battery observation post is now accessible to the public Despite the fortification and artillery used to defend the site, it did not stop the Nazi Luftwaffe successfully hitting Newhaven Fort. On 28 October 1940, nine bombs were dropped on Newhaven Fort, with four hitting the target. One landed within the walls, which created a 20m crater which is still visible, while two landed in the officers' encampment, which is now the customer car park. The four guns facing out towards the sea are also now accessible to the public after being out-of-bounds for four years, Mr Pulham added. They include gun position D, which has an underground passage which the public can walk down to get to the lower area of the fort.",

Teams of volunteers dug up High Tarns Farm in Silloth, Cumbria, in July after crop marks indicated a structure had previously been on the land. Carbon dating of a timber building they discovered suggested it was a \"large hall of the late-Viking age\", archaeologist Mark Graham of Grampus Heritage told volunteers. Mr Graham added the significance of the discovery in shedding light on the early medieval period and social structure in rural Cumbria was \"hard to overstate\". More than 50 volunteers carried out the dig. Mr Graham told BBC Radio Cumbria: \"That excavation [was] totally delivered by community volunteers giving their time every day to come out to the trenches and uncover our shared past.\" Grampus Heritage The area could have been a medieval manor farm, archaeologists said The excavation was carried out in the summer by volunteers In a letter written to volunteers, Mr Graham said load-bearing timbers they had found had a 94% chance of dating back to 990 1040 AD. Similarly, a charcoal production pit and a corn dryer were likely to date back to the late 10th to early 11th Century, he said. \"It seems most likely that the hall is the focus of an early medieval manor farm,\" Mr Graham said. He explained the site appeared similar to high status Viking age farms in Denmark, because it encompassed not only the hall but also the social structure and broader agricultural activity associated with them. Mark Graham Archaeologist Mark Graham said the significance of the discovery was \"hard to overstate\" Mr Graham said it was a remarkable discovery. \"You really do not find much archaeology from that period [the Viking age] in our county,\" he said. \"It's a big gap in our knowledge.\" Grampus led the excavations, which had been funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

        "content": "Beginnings of Roman London discovered in office basement 12 February 2025 Share Save Rebecca Morelle, Science Editor and Alison Francis, Senior Science Journalist Share Save Tony Jolliffe/ BBC The wall is 2,000 years old and was part of Roman London's first basilica A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London. Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made. The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high. The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings. Tony Jolliffe/BBC Archaeologists found the Roman masonry under the concrete floor of the office \"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News. \"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\" Tony Jolliffe/ BBC News The wall is made of limestone from Kent The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped. Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor. On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky. \"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson. Tony Jolliffe/BBC A tile is stamped and the three lines next to it are the finger marks of the tile maker The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high. Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city. The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch. \"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson. \"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\" It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city. But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance. Peter Marsden The basilica sits at the back of the Roman forum, which had an open courtyard The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties. The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public. For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges. \"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot. \"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\" And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building. But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it. \"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\" Woods Bagot An artist's impression of what the public will eventually be able to see",

        "content": "Vladimir Syromiatnikov's bold attempts to light up Siberia with a space mirror captured global attention. The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993. It sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993. But the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell. WATCH: 'On a clear night, it could illuminate an area the size of a football stadium'. Even today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one. Back in 1923, German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth had proposed it in The Rocket into Planetary Space. His self-published book   based on a PhD thesis which Heidelberg University had rejected for seeming too implausible   demonstrated mathematically how a rocket could leave the Earth's orbit. Among the other ideas covered in the publication were the potential effects on the human body of space travel, how satellites could be launched into orbit, and, crucially, the concept of creating a grid of colossal adjustable concave mirrors that could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the Earth. Oberth reasoned that this illumination could help avert disasters   like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912   or assist with the rescue of their survivors. Oberth also speculated that space mirrors could be used to clear shipping lanes by melting icebergs or even to manipulate the Earth's weather patterns.",
