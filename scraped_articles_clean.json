Roderick Nash, emeritus historian at the University of California, is usually credited with inventing the term in 1967 in his book, Wilderness and the American Mind. Often defined as simply the study of human interactions across time with the natural or non-human world, Donald Worster in 1988 subdivided the sub-discipline into the study of ‘nature’ itself, including humans; socio-economic interaction between humans and nature; and the ‘mental interactions’ of humans towards nature, including myths, ideologies, even scientific discourses.",

        "title": "The Rise of Air Conditioning",
        "content": "Politicians and diplomats are heading to Katowice, Poland, in December for the next round of international climate negotiations. This summer s heatwave   an  unambiguous  sign of global warming, according to a recent report   will be in their minds. A major cause of that warming is two centuries of rising consumption of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas). Large-scale coal consumption began during the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century. Oil boomed from the start of the 20th. Use of all fossil fuels then expanded dramatically during the Second World War and the economic boom that followed. This expansion was one of several impacts of economic activity on the natural world that earth systems scientists define collectively as the  great acceleration . This is seen as part of the Anthropocene, a new geological epoch in which the impacts of human activity work on the same scale as great natural forces. The identification in the 1980s of global warming, perhaps the most dangerous such impact, did nothing to slow fossil fuel consumption growth. Today, the quantity of greenhouse gases pumped out by fossil fuel use in three years is about the same as that produced in the whole of the 19th century. Who has been consuming all these fossil fuels? Rather than individual households, it is more accurate to think about technological systems   car-based transport and the urban infrastructure that supports it; electricity networks; industrial systems reliant on carbon-heavy materials such as steel; and agricultural methods that soak up gas-based fertilisers   and the social and economic systems in which they are embedded. Take electric air conditioning (AC) systems, used widely in hot summers. They first appeared in large numbers before the First World War, in the US, which had pioneered the installation of urban electricity networks from the 1880s and led the way in popularising appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and radios. In the 1920s, AC was marketed aggressively, as were electric lighting and motor cars. Manufacturers, anxious to sell to schools, battled furiously against New York state regulators, who argued that fresh air from open windows would be better for pupils  health than conditioned air. Sales of AC units, like other consumer electric goods, soared again in the US in the boom that followed the Second World War. The doubts of homeowners and office managers, many of whom regarded AC as a luxury, were overridden by the construction industry, who were convinced by AC manufacturers to install it as standard. AC made urban growth and industrial production possible in the tropical climate of the US southern states, as the historian Raymond Arsenault showed in his seminal article of 1984,  The End of the Long Hot Summer . In the 1960s, AC was a major cause of the reversal of the trend of out-migration from the South to other parts of the US. By the 1980s, AC, like other energy-guzzling household technologies, was already ubiquitous in US cities and common in other rich countries. Today, such technologies are condemned as wasteful of fossil fuels. An interpretive challenge in researching and discussing the global history of fossil fuel consumption is to explain how   even after the world s governments acknowledged, at the 1992 Rio summit, the need to stop global warming   their use continued to rise. It is a common fallacy that soaring fossil fuel use in the last quarter of a century is largely about first-world consumer technologies, such as AC, being diffused across developing countries. There are small, relatively rich, corners of the global south where these are used, but their contribution to total global fuel consumption is minor. And the fundamental inequalities remain. Canada s per-head energy consumption is estimated at 450 times higher than that of the poorest African countries. US households use four times as much electricity for air conditioning alone as Nigeria s use for everything. But this is not solely about first-world consumers. Final-user technologies develop and spread as part of larger systems. AC, for example, needs a reliable electricity supply, which is beyond the reach not only of 14 per cent of the world s population, who have no electricity, but of a further 25 per cent or so who have limited or erratic supply. Furthermore, AC and other electrical appliances have become a part of life in energy-intensive cities largely built with energy-intensive materials, such as cement and steel. These cities are characterised by badly insulated buildings and energy-wasteful transport systems: these two inefficiencies consume far more fossil fuels than AC systems. During the postwar boom, when fossil fuels were cheap, technologies that used them were scarcely regulated. The 1970s  oil price shocks made for temporary improvement; much of that progress was reversed in the 1980s; the threat of global warming has stimulated little action. From plastics to construction, aviation and car travel, governments allowed (indeed, encouraged) crucial decisions to be made according to companies  profit motives. Japan   where the energy efficiency of new AC systems rose by 68 per cent in the decade to 2005, because regulators required improvements   is the exception that proves the rule, at least in regard to AC. Weak regulation is part of a larger political problem: the ideological conviction that it is market mechanisms that can and must reduce fossil fuel consumption. This belief underpinned both the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which failed to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and the 2015 Paris agreement, with its voluntary   and inadequate   targets. Governments that failed to put money into moving away from fossil fuels nevertheless oversaw hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for those fuels. Technological systems have evolved the way they have because of the social and economic systems in which they are embedded. A move away from fossil fuels requires the wholesale transformation of all these systems. Simon Pirani is the author of Burning Up: A Global History of Fossil Fuel Consumption (Pluto Press, 2018).",

It's a reminder of just how fragile the internet services we rely upon can be. On Monday 20 October 2025, millions of users woke to find their favourite apps, gaming sites, online banking and internet tools were not available. The problem is thought to have been caused by an error with a database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the online retailer's cloud computing division. AWS provides online computing infrastructure for millions of large companies' websites and platforms. The outage affected the hugely popular games Roblox, Fortnite and Pok mon Go, the social media platform Snapchat, productivity tools Slack and Monday.com, along with dozens of banks. It is the latest in a number of high-profile outages to have hit the internet recently. As our infrastructure becomes ever more tangled with the internet, this won't be the last catastrophic online outage either. The history of computing is littered with examples of our digital fragility, and crashes of the past offer a glimpse of what it will feel like on the day the internet turns off. On Friday 19 July, 2024, the world woke up to what many have called the worst digital crisis of all time. A botched software update from cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike crashed some 8.5 million computers, smearing Microsoft's dreaded \"blue screen of death\" across the globe. Airlines cancelled over 46,000 flights in a single day, according to the FlightAware. Hospitals called off surgeries. 911 emergency services faced disruptions in the US. Film Forum, an arthouse cinema in New York, switched to cash payments as its credit card system went down. Microsoft and CrowdStrike issued a solution, but the disruption it caused continued for several days afterwards. It's a reminder, frustrated IT experts said, to never push updates out on a Friday.",

Keith Wade supervised more than 50 digs in the town while working for Suffolk County Council archaeological service for more than 40 years. Ipswich dates back to the 7th Century, was occupied by the Vikings and was burnt down by William the Conqueror. Mr Wade has published a book about the town's 1,400-year history to \"make the early importance of Ipswich more widely known\". Suffolk County Council The 1980s excavation, ahead of the construction of the Buttermarket Shopping Centre, revealed centuries of habitation \"For me, Ipswich has been an outstanding archaeological project,\" he said. \"I was privileged to be in the right place at the right time to excavate in Ipswich for over 40 years.\" His book, titled Gipeswic: The Anglo-Saxon Town of Ipswich, supports Mr Wade's long-held belief Ipswich is the country's oldest town with continuous occupation on the same site. It describes how it began as a landing place for 7th Century European traders and became a permanent town in the early 8th Century. This makes it one of the three earliest English towns - the others being Southampton and London. Suffolk County Council Finds include an early medieval lead brooch, dating back to the 9th Century Mr Wade has been a local archaeologist since 1974 and retired from the county's archaeological service in 2012.

        "content": "Anger as historic Clyde ship towed out to sea and sunk in Hawaii 18 October 2025 Share Save Calum Watson BBC Scotland Share Save Getty Images The Honolulu Harbour Board wanted the ship removed so it could redevelop the harbour A historic Clydebuilt sailing ship has been towed out to sea off the coast of Hawaii and deliberately sunk, prompting outrage from maritime heritage groups. Falls of Clyde, built in 1878, had been moored as a museum ship in Honolulu since the 1960s but had fallen into a poor state of repair. The Honolulu Harbour Board confirmed it had the ship towed into deep water about 25 miles offshore on Wednesday and then scuttled. The news has been met with anger and dismay by campaigners who have spent more than a decade trying to bring the ship back to its birthplace to rebuild it. Falls of Clyde was the first in a series of nine iron-hulled ships, all named after Scottish waterfalls, built in the late 19th Century by the Port Glasgow shipbuilder Russell & Co. The ship spent many years carrying various cargoes to and from the Far East and Australasia before moving to Hawaii. Hawaii Department of Transportation Falls of Clyde was towed out of Honolulu Harbour at dawn and scuttled in deep water In the early 20th Century it had steel tanks fitted and was converted into a tanker to carry paraffin to the islands, where it later became a floating fuel depot before being acquired by a museum in Honolulu. But the ship was badly damaged by a hurricane in the 1980s, the maritime section of the museum closed down and for years it has been left slowly decaying. Enthusiasts in Scotland have spent a decade trying to bring the ship home for restoration, but were unable to reach an agreement with the harbour board which wants to redevelop the quay where it was moored. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said the operation to remove the ship began at dawn on Wednesday and it was sunk about 25 miles south of the harbour. It said the vessel's name, wheel and bell were retained along with other artefacts which will be put on display. 'A day that will go down in infamy' The destruction of the historic ship has been widely criticised by maritime heritage groups both in the UK and the USA. Friends of Falls of Clyde, a group of supporters in Hawaii, described it as \"a day that will go down in infamy\". \"It is almost inconceivable that this situation has been allowed to happen,\" the group posted on social media. The group organised a farewell ceremony with bagpipers on Tuesday after learning that the ship was to be sunk the following morning. The Tall Ship Glenlee, the charity that looks after another Clydebuilt sailing vessel moored beside Glasgow's Riverside Museum, said it was \"deeply saddened\". Falls of Clyde had been one of only six surviving large sailing vessels built on the Clyde, and only two remain in the UK - Glenlee and the Cutty Sark. David O'Neill, from the Scotland based Save Falls of Clyde campaign, said he was \"horrified\" at the behaviour of the authorities in Hawaii but had become resigned to the ship meeting such a fate after years of fruitless negotiation. He first became involved in efforts to rescue the ship in 2015 when someone in Hawaii alerted him to its condition, prompting him to post an appeal on social media saying: \"Old Scottish lady needs a lift home.\" A Norwegian firm which operates heavy lift ships offered to transport Falls of Clyde back to Scotland for free, but the campaign was soon embroiled in a wrangle with the harbour board over insurance costs and other conditions. A 19th Century oil painting of Falls of Clyde when it sailed in the Far East Earlier this year Mr O'Neill said an American firm won a contract to remove the ship from the harbour and it also offered to transport it to Scotland for free. \"They didn't want to sink the ship - they had a conscience and a respect for maritime heritage,\" he said. But the deal between the firm and the harbour board fell through, and the contract went instead to another company which then carried out the scuttling. The Hawaii Department of Transportation (DOT) director Ed Sniffen said it had made the \"difficult but necessary\" decision in a bid to protect the immediate and long-term security of Honolulu Harbour. \"The port is the state's economic lifeline as 85% of goods consumed in Hawaii must be imported and 91% of those goods reach our islands through this critical facility,\" he said. \"Since 2008, the Hawaii DOT afforded ample opportunity to the Friends of Falls of Clyde and other parties interested in restoring, preserving, and/or repatriating the vessel. \"A number of well-intentioned plans and efforts were not fruitful and did not address the risk the deteriorating vessel posed to the port.\" He said that before the ship was sunk the contractor removed materials that may degrade the marine environment, including pollutants and items that could create debris. He added that the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act permit also required consideration of land-based alternatives prior to authorisation of ocean disposal but no land-based disposal options were determined to be feasible.

        "content": "Skeletons found in mass grave are ancient Roman soldiers, study finds Scientists believe the skeletons, which were found completely intact, belong to men who lived 1,700 years ago Now, researchers from several European archaeological institutions have been able to determine not only when the men lived, but also how they may have died. Mursa was conquered by the Romans during the first century BC and became a large settlement that was also an important centre for trade and craft. The male skeletons, all with various injuries, were found \"completely preserved\" during excavations in 2011 at the site of the Roman city of Mursa - modern-day Osijek - in Croatia's far east, a new research paper says. Scientists say seven skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia were most likely Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago. According to the paper, the men in the grave were aged between 36-50 years old, taller-than-average in height, and were \"robust\" individuals. Their diets were mainly vegetarian, but some had also indulged in a little meat and seafood. All showed various healed and un-healed injuries, including those caused by blunt force trauma, and there were puncture wounds on two of their torsos, which the scientists believe were likely caused by arrows or spear tips. All of the men were suffering from some kind of \"pulmonary [affecting the lungs] disease during the final days of their lives\". DNA analysis has also revealed the men had a mix of ancestry and that none appeared to be from the local area. The paper noted that the Roman Empire was a particularly violent era and that Mursa was involved in several conflicts. The researchers believe the men were likely victims of the 'Crisis of the Third Century', most probably the battle of Mursa from 260 CE, when there were \"numerous battles fought between various claimants to the throne\". The paper states that the pit the skeletons were found in would have originally been a water-well - several of which have been discovered in the area. It notes that mass burials and mass graves were \"not a customary way of interring the dead in the Roman Empire\", and were mostly used in extreme situations and mass casualty events. Given the various angles the skeletons now lie, the researchers say they were \"most probably thrown in\" the well before being covered with soil. Mursa has been of archaeological importance for years, with various ancient civilisation sites discovered in the area.",

Producer Robert \"Bumps\" Blackwell said he didn't appreciate Richard until he saw him play at the city's famous Dew Drop Inn. He said: \"That was when I begin to know and understand Richard, because all you've got to do is give Richard an audience, turn the lights on, and the show is on.\" Richard's bandmate and friend Ron Jones recalled in the Arena documentary: \"He jumped on the piano and sang, 'Awop-bop-a loo bop alop-bam-boom!' So they heard it and said, 'Wait a minute, what's that?' It was a hook that they had never heard before, but Richard had been singing that phrase for years on the Chitlin' Circuit.\" Richard's influence spanned generations and genres But if Tutti Frutti was going to be a hit record, its risqu  lyrics needed a major rewrite. Deacon John, former band leader at the Dew Drop Inn, told Arena: \"The lyrics could be interpreted as gay sex. They're not going to play that on the radio!... And everybody knew, this ain't about ice cream! But the primary reaction from the producer's point of view was, 'Hey, this sounds like a hit record.'\" Producer \"Bumps\" Blackwell said: \"I asked him did he have a grudge against making money? He said, 'No.' I said, 'Good.' So we wrote the words,'Tutti frutti, oh rooty,' and a girl named Sue and a girl named Daisy, put Richard on the piano, and in 15 minutes I think we cut two or three cuts, and it's been history ever since.\" The recording may have been unbeatable, but in the US it wasn't the biggest hit version. The man who introduced the delights of Tutti Frutti to the mainstream was Pat Boone, a squeaky-clean square who specialised in taming rock'n'roll for a mostly white audience. If he had known about the original lyrics at the time, he probably would have been appalled. Boone told Arena: \"What I wanted to sing were songs about love and happiness and all that. That was what they played on the radio back then. Rhythm and blues music was called race music. Here I am, a church-going white kid from Nashville. I knew very little of it. But then when I heard a song by Little Richard called Tutti Frutti, I just flat-out loved it and so I thought, 'I'm going to do my version of it.'\" It sold one million records.

The Peebles Hoard, which had lain undisturbed for 3,000 years before it was discovered in 2020, was acquired by National Museums Scotland (NMS) last year. It comprises more than 500 unusual bronze and organic objects and components, many \"without archaeological parallel anywhere in the world\".

Dating from between 1,000 and 800BC, it was allocated to NMS under the Treasure Trove system, with a payment made to the detectorist Mariusz Stepien who found it. NMS said the defining technological characteristic of the Bronze Age was the widespread use and production of bronze - an alloy of copper and tin that is usually a deep golden colour. However, conservation of the Peebles Hoard has revealed rare silver-coloured objects from an era when silver was unknown. Crown Copyright Hundreds of pieces were discovered by a metal detectorist in 2020 Analysis has revealed the colour is the result of high levels of tin on the surface.

Devotees will be allowed to worship the Sacred Tooth Relic today from 12 noon to 5.30 p.m. today (19). The religious observance began yesterday at 2.30 p.m. and concluded at 5:30 p.m., granting thousands the chance to pay homage to the Sacred Relic after a gap of 16 years. Over 100,000 devotees had visited the Sri Dalada Maligawa on the opening day. Many who were unable to worship the Sacred Relic yesterday remained overnight in Kandy in hopes of doing so today. A  Dansala  organized by the Sri Dalada Maligawa for visiting devotees was held last night, with  Diyawadana Nilame  Pradeep Nilanga Dela also in attendance. The  Dansala  served dinner to approximately 35,000 people daily from 7.30 p.m. to 2.00 a.m. A special dining hall capable of accommodating 1,000 people at a time has also been set up. To manage the massive influx of worshippers, three main access routes have been arranged: -From D.S. Senanayake Street to the Sri Dalada Maligawa entrance, -From Rathu Bokkuwa via Sangharaja Mawatha to the main entrance, -From Rathu Bokkuwa via Maligawa Place to the main entrance. Each of these queues had stretched over 4 kilometers by this afternoon (19). In the meantime, special public transport services are in operation for devotees traveling from across the island, including Colombo. Sri Lanka Railways has deployed eight additional daily train services to Kandy, while the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) is running special bus services from several major cities. To ensure public health and safety, the Sri Lanka Public Health Inspectors  Association has deployed nearly 50 public health inspectors daily. Their duties include inspecting food outlets, monitoring garbage disposal, and ensuring adequate drinking water and toilet facilities for devotees. However, authorities noted that some pilgrims had carelessly disposed garbage at various locations in the city. Health officials are urging the public to responsibly dispose of waste in designated areas and help maintain a clean environment.

        "content": "Who is Sri Lanka s new president Anura Kumara Dissanayake? 22 September 2024 Share Save Gavin Butler BBC News Share Save Getty Images Anura Kumara Dissanayake positioned himself as a candidate for change Left-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been elected as Sri Lanka s next president after he won the debt-ridden country s first election since its economy collapsed in 2022. The 55-year-old beat off his nearest rival, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, to emerge as the clear winner after a historic second round of counting, which included second-preference votes. Outgoing president Ranil Wikremesinghe trailed in third. It's a remarkable turnaround for a man who won just 3% of the votes in the 2019 election. Dissanayake, who contested as candidate for the National People's Power (NPP) alliance, has drawn increasing support in recent years for his anti-corruption platform and pro-poor policies   particularly in the wake of the country s worst ever economic crisis, which is still having an impact on millions. He will now inherit governance of a nation that is struggling to emerge from the shadow of that crisis, and a populace that is desperate for change. So who is president-elect Anura Kumara Dissanayake? A former Marxist Dissanayake was born on 24 November, 1968 in Galewela, a Sinhala-majority and multi-religious town in central Sri Lanka. Raised as a member of the lower middle-class, he is state school educated, has a degree in physics, and first entered politics as a student around the time when the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement was signed in 1987: an event that would lead to one of Sri Lanka s bloodiest periods. From 1987 to 1989, the Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP) - a Marxist political party with which Dissanayake would later become closely associated - spearheaded an armed revolt against the Sri Lankan government. The insurrectionist campaign, spurred by discontent among the youth of the rural lower and middle classes, precipitated a conflict marked by raids, assassinations and attacks against both political opponents and civilians which claimed thousands of lives. Dissanayake, who was elected to the JVP s central committee in 1997 and became its leader in 2008, has since apologised for the group s violence during this so-called \"season of terror\". \"A lot of things happened during the armed conflict that should not have happened,\" he said in a 2014 interview with the BBC. \"We are still shocked, and shocked that things happened at our hands that should not have happened. We are always deeply saddened and shocked about that.\" The JVP, which currently has just three seats in parliament, is part of the NPP coalition that Dissanayake now heads. Getty Images Supporters listen to Anura Kumara Dissanayake during a campaign rally on 16 September, 2024 A 'different' leader While campaigning for the presidential election, Dissanayake addressed another violent moment in Sri Lanka s recent history: the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings. On 21 April 2019, a succession of deadly blasts tore through churches and international hotels across the capital Colombo, killing at least 290 people and injuring hundreds more in what quickly became the worst attack in Sri Lanka s history. Five years later, however, investigations into how the co-ordinated attacks happened, and the security failures that led to them, have failed to provide answers. Some have accused the former government, led by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, of obstructing investigations. In a recent interview with BBC Sinhala, Dissanayake promised he would hold an investigation into the matter if elected   suggesting that authorities had avoided doing so because they were afraid of revealing \"their own responsibility\". It s just one of many unfulfilled promises from Sri Lanka s political elite, he added. \"It s not just this investigation,\" he said. \"Politicians who promised to stop corruption have engaged in corruption; those who promised to create a debt-free Sri Lanka have only worsened the debt burden; people who promised to strengthen the law have broken it. \"This is exactly why the people of this country want different leadership. We are the ones who can provide it.\" A candidate for change Dissanayake was viewed as a strong contender in the lead-up to Saturday s election, positioning himself as the candidate for change against a backdrop of simmering nationwide discontent. Former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was driven out of Sri Lanka in 2022 by mass protests sparked by the economic meltdown. Years of under-taxation, weak exports and major policy errors, combined with the Covid-19 pandemic, dried up the country s foreign exchange reserves. Public debt reached more than $83bn and inflation soared to 70%. Getty Images Sri Lanka's 2022 economic crisis saw people queueing for basic necessities. Two years later, many are still struggling Rajapaksa and his government were blamed for the crisis. And though his successor, President Wickremesinghe, introduced economic reforms that brought down inflation and strengthened the Sri Lankan rupee, people continue to feel the pinch. On a deeper level, the 2022 economic crisis and the circumstances surrounding it   including systemic corruption and political impunity   created demand for a different kind of political leadership. Dissanayake has leveraged that demand to his advantage. He has cast himself as a potential disruptor to a status quo which critics say has long rewarded corruption and cronyism among the political elite. Dissanayake has repeatedly said he plans to dissolve parliament after coming to power, in order to have a clean slate and a fresh mandate for his policies   suggesting in a recent interview with BBC Sinhala that he would do this within days of being elected. \"There is no point continuing with a parliament that is not in line with what the people want,\" he said. An advocate for the poor Among Dissanayake s policy pledges are tough anti-corruption measures, bigger welfare schemes and a promise to slash taxes. Tax hikes and welfare cuts were imposed by the current government as part of austerity measures aimed at steering the country s economy back on track   but they also left many people unable to make ends meet. Dissanayake s promise to rein in those measures appears to have galvanised support among voters, in an election where analysts predicted economic concerns would be front of mind. \"The country's soaring inflation, skyrocketing cost-of-living and poverty have left the electorate desperate for solutions to stabilise prices and improve livelihoods,\" Soumya Bhowmick, an associate fellow at India-based think tank the Observer Research Foundation, told the BBC before the election. \"With the country seeking to emerge from its economic collapse, this election serves as a crucial moment for shaping Sri Lanka s recovery trajectory and restoring both domestic and international confidence in its governance.\" Getty Images Dissanayake's pledges to cut taxes and boost welfare proved popular with voters Some onlookers, including investors and market participants, expressed concern that Dissanayake s economic policies could have an impact on fiscal targets and disrupt Sri Lanka s road to recovery. The presidential candidate tempered his messaging during campaign speeches, however, insisting that he was committed to ensuring repayment of Sri Lanka s debt. He also noted that any changes would be imposed in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has provided a buttress for the country s still-embattled economy. Many analysts think the next president's main task is building a stable economy. Athulasiri Samarakoon, senior lecturer in political science and international studies at the Open University of Sri Lanka, told the BBC that \"the most serious challenge is how to restore this economy\", including managing public expenditure and increasing public revenue generation. \"Any future government will have to work with the International Monetary Fund,\" he noted.

Former MP Duminda Silva was sentenced to death along with four others in 2016 for shooting dead a rival politician and three of his supporters in 2011. Mr Silva, who was a political ally of Mr Rajapaksa, is among 94 prisoners to be given a presidential pardon. Rights activists have reacted angrily. \"It shows complete disdain on the part of the executive for the rule of law, for legal process and for public accountability,\" Ambika Satkunanathan, a human rights lawyer based in Colombo told the BBC. Mr Rajapaksa came to power on a Sinhala nationalist campaign in November 2019. He was the powerful defence secretary when his elder brother, Mahinda, was president from 2005 to 2015. Among those released included 16 people from the minority Tamil community accused of links with the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels. The group was vanquished in a bloody civil war that ended in 2009. Some have been held for more than a decade under the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Colombo-based diplomats and rights activists have welcomed the early release of those held under the anti-terrorism law, which activists describe as draconian. The UN and the US have been pressing Sri Lanka for accountability for alleged war crimes committed during the nearly three-decade old war with the Tamil rebels and to release those held under the PTA. The Sri Lankan government has consistently denied war crime accusations. Allow X content? X s cookie policy privacy policy  accept and continue . This article contains content provided by X .

It was one of the few convictions from the civil war era, and the UN said the pardon was \"an affront to victims\".

The two men were both members of the then governing party. The verdict was later upheld by the country's Supreme Court in 2018. \"Sri Lanka has an accountability problem. Even in the few cases where criminal accountability has been achieved, we see the outcomes undermined by this type of pardon,\" Rory Mungoven, Asia-Pacific chief at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights told the BBC. \"It is not just in relation to human rights cases; this relates to the functioning of the criminal justice system for Sri Lanka as a whole. It is a matter of concern for all Sri Lankans when the rule of law and judicial process are undermined in this way.\" When contacted, the Sri Lankan president's office did not comment further on the pardoning of Mr Silva.

I have written to the president (Mr Rajapaksa) saying he's dragging us to hell,\" Ms Premachandra, also a former MP, said. Hirunika Premachandra said it was no longer possible to trust the judicial system While convicted murderers have been pardoned, activists point out that others, like human rights lawyer Hejaz Hizbullah, have been languishing in jail for months. The former director of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Sri Lanka police, Shani Abeysekara, also spent months in jail. Mr Abeysekara was detained for about 10 months facing accusations that include falsely implicating a fellow officer, who was convicted of murder. He also headed the investigation into Duminda Silva's crime that led to his sentencing in 2016 and other alleged rights abuses during the previous Rajapaksa regime. One of the well-known cases he was following was the disappearance of a political cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda, who left home never to return in early 2010. Mr Ekneligoda was a trenchant critic of the Rajapaksas. Mr Hizbullah has been in prison for more than a year under the PTA anti-terrorism law for alleged involvement in Islamic radicalisation. \"This is an absolute lie and we are determined to prove his innocence in court,\" one of his lawyers said. The European Parliament earlier this month passed a resolution expressing concerns over Sri Lanka's human rights violations. The resolution also urged the European Commission to suspend the duty free access to Sri Lankan goods (known as GSP Plus). The suspension of duty free access will hit hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Sri Lankan exports to the EU, particularly ready-to-wear clothes. This will be a huge setback as Sri Lanka is already facing a major economic challenge due to repeated coronavirus lock downs.",

        "title": "Faith in Chains: The Hijacking of Islam by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan",
        "content": "There is a malicious paradox that still haunts humanity s conscience: one that is concealed in religious jargon that reeks of violence and revenge, in the echo of war screams and the shadow of smoke rising from the wreckage of broken lives. There are those who call themselves fighters for Islam, but assault soldiers and civilians, claim innocence and carry deadly weapons as if they were proud and honorable trophies. Organizations like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in the tribal belt of Pakistan serve as an easy example of such a group of people who violate the religious principles they claim to support. The TTP is one of the longest-lasting instances of terrorism in Pakistan that misinterprets Islam to serve a political purpose. The TTP   a group that emerged from the tribal belt following the US takeover of Afghanistan   aimed to impose its own twisted interpretation of Sharia, which not only targeted state institutions but also innocent citizens, schools, polio workers and religious minorities   actions that directly conflict with Islamic teachings. The TTP does not have political grievances or seek regional independence like many other militant groups; instead, it explicitly uses violence as a religious obligation. This makes its misuse of Islamic principles particularly significant and relevant to consider within the context of faith-based radicalization. The TTP s extremist rhetoric employs religious language to justify violence, and it remains crucial to return to the true meaning of Islam to counter these distorted terrorist ideologies. Religion was never the reason The reason behind such extremist groups is rooted in political and psychological systems and stems greatly from being uninformed and depressed. Research into poverty, conflict and development in Pakistan has shown that poverty can lead to radicalization of beliefs. Such research demonstrates that financial and social problems, rather than religious beliefs, create a prime environment for joining an extremist group. When young people are deprived of hope, education and opportunities, they become impressionable and vulnerable. This creates space for terrorists to exploit. Instead of being guided by genuine religious teachings, these youths are fed anger and resentment, dressed up as devotion to God. Through such manipulation, acts of violence are sanctified in their eyes, legitimizing revenge and sacrifice as something sacred. An Iranian study on the resurgence of the TTP shows that this group, which continues to inspire radical extremists today, did so by abandoning all principles of kindness, fairness and moderation established in Islam. They became notorious for their rigidity, rejecting any differences and excluding Muslims from their community for the slightest reasons. The current TTP has persisted in these wrongdoings and only intensified them. Their cruelty is driven by fanaticism, which disregards the mercy at the core of Islam. Authentic Islamic teachings never condone such actions Religion, according to the Holy Qur an (the central religious text of Islam) and the teachings of the founder of Islam, Prophet Muhammad, has nothing to do with violence; it is never linked to fire and bullets. In fact, in Islam, spreading fitnah   discord and strife   is considered among the gravest of evils. In the Qur an s Surah Al-Ma idah, verse 5:32, it is said clearly:  Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land, it is as if he had slain mankind entirely.  If a life is taken, it is as if a whole universe is lost. Islam holds the sanctity of life in the highest regard. But these extremist groups change the meaning of holy words, isolate parts of scripture and mislead people to support their bloodthirsty actions. While pretending to believe, terrorists work to control the community by threatening them. Terrorism only reveals the low moral values of those who commit it. They claim to seek justice, yet in reality, they just cause more destruction and ruin. In Islam, justice is not pursued through violence and guns; instead, its advocates seek justice by using respectful procedures, kindness and honesty. Several Islamic sources (like the Sirah and Hadith collections) recount that when the Prophet Muhammad faced deep persecution in Mecca, through mockery, boycott and attempts on his life, he showed restraint and entrusted justice to God. After the Muslim victory in 630 CE, known as the Conquest of Makkah, he marked his triumph not with revenge but with a general amnesty, forgiving long-standing enemies. He spoke the famous words,  Go, for you are free.  If violence is justified in the name of religion, it becomes even more dangerous because the perpetrators believe their actions carry divine approval. The Qur an, however, repeatedly stresses that peace should be the foremost goal for Muslims. If there is conflict between groups of believers, Surah Al-Hujurat, verse 49:9, advises them to find a solution.  If two groups among the believers should fight, then make a settlement between them. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the command of Allah.  This verse does not promote rebellion or terrorism. It commands one to pursue peace and justice in accordance with moral and rightful conduct. Terrorism rejects human dignity No matter the claims made, terrorism is an inhumane act that betrays the religion it purports to uphold. Supposed martyrdom achieved through killing, taking pleasure in spilling blood or committing suicide attacks are not acts of true faith; they demonstrate a lack of courage. Revenge against innocent individuals holds no honor, and hatred brings only further suffering. True strength lies in self-control, in the capacity to forgive those who deserve retribution and in helping others rather than spreading terror. The actions of groups like the TTP contradict Islamic principles rather than represent them. Every bomb detonated and bullet fired distances people from the message of peace that Islam carries. Jihad, in its true Islamic context, symbolizes  struggle  in the path of Allah, embodying the efforts to lead a virtuous life and to do better, making jihad a holy act. But instead of using the actual spiritual context, TTP has radicalized jihad by sowing chaos, confusion and suffering. Efforts should extend beyond security measures to reclaim the true perception of Islam. Communities, and especially the young, must be guided toward the religion s authentic teachings, which emphasize life over death and faith over fear. They should learn that prayer, compassion, and peace are stronger than violence, even in the face of oppression. Organizations like TTP are fueled by secrecy, lack of knowledge, fear and division. The antidote is light. Light in our minds, light in how we treat others, and the knowledge that Islam is indeed a religion of peace. Choosing mercy over revenge requires real strength; resisting hatred is far more powerful than fire. Fire doesn t match the strength of faith.

The event began in the US in the 1920s, and has been recognised in the UK throughout October since 1987, as a way of sharing, celebrating and understanding the impact of black heritage and culture. \"It's very important to know where we are coming from and where we are going,\" said Glen Crooks, who runs Glen's Kitchen out of St Pauls Learning Centre in Bristol. \"Black history should be taught all the time, not just in a month,\" he added. A free exhibition focusing on 500 years of black music in Britain will take place between 13-31 October at the centre. Glens Kitchen Glen's Kitchen in Bristol was featured on the BBC's Remarkable Places to Eat series Mr Crooks moved to England in 1967 to be with his mother after being raised by his grandmother in Jamaica. He said while growing up he was not taught about campaigners such as Martin Luther King or Paul Bogle. \"We are coming from a long, long way from slavery. As black people we've been through a lot but we still come out strong,\" he said. Elsewhere in Bristol, a pop up exhibition called Bristol Bus Boycott X, which marks 60 years of the Race Relations Act 1965, will be on show at the Vestibules under City Hall until 17 October, before moving to Sparks Bristol, Wills Memorial Building and the M Shed.

Mr Campbell said he became a visual activist after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis by police officer Derek Chauvin. The event five years ago led to nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. Mr Campbell said: \"I remember being angry and upset and asking what am I supposed to do?\" He has since photographed more than 100 protests around the world. Mr Campbell said he believed \"education is key\", commenting that in rural areas \"if there are people willing to learn and understand about sections of society they weren't aware of in the past, that's great\". The photographer will be in conversation on 14 October at the Shoemakers Museum. Meanwhile, the actor and author Paterson Joseph will be at Westlands in Yeovil on 24 October speaking about his book Ten Children Who Changed The World, as part of Yeovil Literary Festival. Here are some more Black History Month events taking place in Somerset. Florence Nyasamo Florence Nyasamo said often there is too much focus on the past during Black History Month Florence Nyasamo, the founder of Lives of Colour in Cheltenham, said the month was important for celebrating the local community. Lives of Colour works with businesses, local authorities and schools advising on diversity initiatives and inclusion training. In 2024's Black History Month, the organisation launched a year-long programme of educational events, including students debating race equity and inclusivity in council decision-making. \"The focus is always in the past, Martin Luther King, Mandela, but what about the spaces we live in?,\" said Ms Nyasamo. \"What contributions are communities making? Because this is what will make this visible and why this conversation is important.\" Having moved to the UK 30 years ago from Kenya, Ms Nyasamo said the proudest moment of her life was when she helped arrange for Gloucestershire County Council to fly the pan African flag outside its office. Also during Black History Month, a new adaptation of William Shakespeare's Richard II will be performed in a Southern African Township theatre style at Swindon Arts Centre on 25 October. The play features an original score of Zimbabwean music and song. Elsewhere in Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire, libraries are promoting literature by black authors during October.

        "title": "'Paintings were suddenly seen as money': The reason art heists exploded in the 1970s",
        "content": "Acclaimed new film The Mastermind, starring Josh O'Connor, tells the story of an art robbery gone wrong. It's inspired by a wave of similar thefts during a decade known for upheaval. In May 1972, two men walked into the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts and hurried out carrying four paintings by Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso and a supposed Rembrandt (now believed to be the work of one of his students), holding a group of visiting high school students at gunpoint and shooting a security guard in the process. With the stolen artworks' worth tallying up to $2m ( 1.5m), the New York Times ranked it among \"the largest art robberies in modern times\". Some say it even inspired a far more famous crime nearby: the 1990 heist at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, in which $500m ( 370m) of art was looted, making it the costliest theft in US history full stop, with the crime remaining unsolved. The Worcester heist was orchestrated by career criminal Florian \"Al\" Monday, but the game was up after the two thieves he hired for the raid boasted about their exploits in their local bar. Within a month, the paintings were safely retrieved from a pig farm in Rhode Island and returned to the gallery. \"Ironically, Monday   before he was an art thief   had a band, and I have the 45 of his record,\" writer-director Kelly Reichardt tells the BBC. Her new film The Mastermind, which is released in the US this weekend, is loosely inspired by the chain of events that followed the Worcester robbery, as well as the wave of art heists that followed over the course of that decade. Mubi New film The Mastermind centres on middle-class art school drop-out turned robber JB (played by Josh O'Connor) (Credit: Mubi) Praised by The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw for locating \"the unglamour in the heist\", Reichardt's thoughtful art crime caper dismantles the usual rules of the glitzy, sensationalised heist movie. Blockbusters have long popularised the idea that there is something classy about this category of crime, particularly when it involves art: think, for example, of the 1999 version of The Thomas Crown Affair, in which Pierce Brosnan plays a very suave billionaire orchestrating a raid on New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.",

        "content": "Project leader and veteran Nessie hunter Adrian Shine told the BBC: \"I think if we were to get a fish on the scale that the contacts would suggest then I don't think anyone would be too dissatisfied, and all those eyewitnesses would get their vindication.\" The mission's success was seen as inconclusive   \"not proven\", as Scots law might say. Sonar expert Darrell Lowrance certainly hedged his bets: \"That doesn't mean there's a monster here, but it doesn't mean also that I suppose that there is not. I wouldn't want to be lynched in northern Scotland.\" Tourists were unfazed. One woman insisted she had \"distinctly\" seen the Monster during her visit. As the BBC's Clive Ferguson concluded: \"If nothing else, Operation Deepscan has proved one thing; you cannot kill a legend with science.\" It went out into the loch, turned round in a swirl and just disappeared   Aldie Mackay The original Nessie legend dates to the 6th Century, when the medieval Irish monk St Columba is said to have encountered a creature in the River Ness, which flows from the loch. The modern monster myth began in 1933 with a rather reluctant eyewitness. One sunny spring day, hotel manager Aldie Mackay spotted something unusual in the water. It wasn't until 50 years later that she chose to give her first radio interview, on the BBC's The World This Weekend. Mackay said that the loch's surface had been calm   \"it looked as if you'd gone over it with an iron\"   when suddenly the thing emerged. \"It was so unusual that you just didn't believe what you were seeing. It just came up; it might have been an elephant, it might have been a whale, it might have been anything. It was big and black and shiny because it was wet. It went out into the loch, turned round in a swirl and just disappeared.\" Having been more than aware of the local monster folklore   \"you read all the stories of kelpies and things\"   she said she laughed to herself that \"this is the beast, but I don't believe it\".",

        "content": "Sixty years ago, anthology series Out of the Unknown premiered on the BBC. It served up serious, one-off sci-fi dramas exploring our relationship with technology, among other things. In a crowded TV landscape, few shows have carved out as distinct a niche as Black Mirror, Netflix's anthology sci-fi series comprised of individual, standalone dramas, all dealing with the dark side of modernity and technological progress. But while it may be strikingly different from anything else out there now, it's certainly not unique within TV history. In fact, you can see its roots all the way back in a classic British sci-fi show celebrating its 60th anniversary this month. Airing on the BBC between 1965 and 1971, and re-released on DVD in 2014 by the British Film Institute, Out of the Unknown was a cultural outlier. While there were various sci-fi shows on British and US TV at the time, they mostly offered escapism, such as Doctor Who (1963-89) and Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's various serials like Stingray (1964-65) and Thunderbirds (1965). Out of the Unknown's aim was more elevated: it set out to tell sci-fi tales that explored serious, adult subjects such as war, politics and technology, and mixed original scripts with adaptations of stories by celebrated authors like John Wyndham, Ray Bradbury and JG Ballard. Like the best sci-fi, it also managed to depict imagined futures while really commenting on the fears and tensions facing the world at the time of its production. BFI/ BBC One of the show's most remarkable episodes, an adaptation of EM Forster's The Machine Stops, foresaw the internet age (Credit: BFI/ BBC) In this respect and others, the parallels with Black Mirror are clear although there is an irony to this comparison. \"I have to confess I haven't seen it!\" Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker tells the BBC. \"The inspiration for Black Mirror really came from Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone, and lots of slightly odd BBC single dramas like [Nigel Kneale's] The Stone Tape and The Year of the Sex Olympics. I'm definitely riffing on work directly connected to [Out of the Unknown], yet I haven't seen it. It's interesting!\"",

        "title": "Going underground at the Colosseum",
        "content": "Rome has many great spectacles below street leve and the latest are the underground chambers and passageways at the Colosseum, due to open to the public from late August 2010. Rome s Colosseum (Piazza del Colosseo) just got even more interesting. The great 80,000-capacity stadium, where the masses used to bay for blood at free spectacles involving gladiators, wild beasts and those unlucky enough to get on the wrong side of the Empire, is due to open its underground passageways to the public from late August 2010. This part of the building was where the afternoon's entertainment used to cower pre-performance. It will be accessible through the back entrance once used by gladiators, with a new glass lift sinking down into the bowels of the building. The architect in charge of the project, Barbara Nazzaro, says that visitors will be able to see where the lions, tigers, bulls, ostriches and gazelles were kept in cells before being hoisted up on 80 rope-slung lifts to the ground floor. This process was a remarkable theatrical device, as the wild beasts used to appear as if out of nowhere onto the stage. Gladiators and scenery were also hoisted up in the same way. The elephants, however, were too heavy to be lifted up, so used to make their grand entrance through the main gates. This is a building that has until now been rather more impressive from the outside, but the opening of the underground sections means that visitors will be able to envisage the entertainments held here from a new, if chilling perspective. The other new section of the building that will be opening shortly is the highest part of the remaining seating, allowing spectacular views across the stadium. Rendering visits even more spookily evocative, the Colosseum is open till midnight on Saturdays from 21 August to the 23 October 2010. Rome has numerous other places where it is possible to explore underground, and perhaps nowhere sums up this multi-layered city more perfectly than St Clemente (Via di San Giovanni in Laterano). This is a 12th-Century church, lined with a shimmering apse mosaic. But it is discovering the staircase down to the next layer of history that makes this Rome's most extraordinary church. The steep staircase down leads to a 4th-Century church, decorated with fading frescoes. Yet something even more mystical and mysterious lies beneath: the next staircase down leads to a Roman house and pagan temple, complete with altar showing Mithras killing a bull. And echoing through the ancient temple is the sound of a river flowing even beneath this layer, running through a Republic-era drain. Rome's other great underground adventure lies out near the Appia Antica, to the southeast of town. Here are the catacombs, where Christians used to bury their dead, in a kind of warren-like after-dead ghetto outside the city walls. The most famous are the Catacombs of San Callisto (Via Appia Antico 110 & 126), the first official cemetery after the Roman Catholic church was founded at the end of the 2nd Century. This spider's web of narrow tunnels, complete with coffin-sized cavities, opens out into dark subterranean churches - a most evocative way to end an underground tour of Rome. The article 'Going underground at the Colosseum' was published in partnership with Lonely Planet.",

        "content": "In the towns along the Golden Ring bells ring out from towering belfries, robed holy men scurry through church doors and historic tales recall mysterious, magical times. A journey around the Golden Ring retraces Russian history back to the beginning. This is the clutch of towns northeast of Moscow where ancient Rus grew into the Russian nation. In many cases, the whitewashed walls of these once-fortified cities still stand and the golden spires and onion domes of their monasteries still puncture the sky. Bells ring out from towering belfries; robed holy men scurry through church doors; historic tales recall mysterious, magical times. Day 1: Vladimir About 175km east from Moscow, your first stop is Vladimir, which was the seat of the throne in the 12th Century. High up on the slope above the Klyazma River sits the solemnly majestic Assumption Cathedral, built to announce Vladimir's claim as capital of Rus. Spend an hour admiring the detailed carving and the 15th Century frescoes painted by Russia's foremost icon painters, before retiring to the quaint and comfortable Monomakh Hotel. Day 2: Suzdal Drive 35km north to the enchanting village of Suzdal. The winding Kamenka River, flower-drenched meadows and dome-spotted skyline make this medieval capital a perfect fairytale setting. Peeking over the Kremlin walls are the star-spangled domes of the village's oldest church, the Nativity of the Virgin Cathedral (AD1220-onwards). A walk along the earthen ramparts reveals a veritable medieval wonderland with magnificent views of three monasteries, two convents and some thirty smaller churches. Afterwards, you can dine at the Kremlin refectory (trapeznaya), which has been serving delicious food for centuries. Day 3: Kostroma Get up early for the 173km drive to the northernmost point on the Golden Ring. Kostroma was founded in 1152, but the historic centre dates to the 18th Century, when the old wooden structures were demolished by fire. Spend the afternoon exploring the 14th Century Monastery of St Ipaty, which poses on the right bank of the Kostroma River. Exhibits are dedicated to the young boyar Mikhail Romanov, who was in exile here when he was elected tsar, thus launching the dynasty. Spend the night at the aptly named Hotel Volga, a Soviet-era establishment offering timeless river views. Day 4: Yaroslavl About 76km west, this is the namesake of Kyivan prince Yaroslav the Wise, who founded the town in 1010. His statue overlooks the town square, opposite the formidable 12th Century Monastery of the Transfiguration of the Saviour. Stroll along the banks of the Volga River and discover the myriad merchant churches, most of which date to the city's 17th Century heyday as a trading centre. Take a break to recover at an outdoor cafe along the quaint cobblestone pedestrian street ulitsa Kirova. Day 5: Rostov-Veliky Drive about 60km south along the road headed back to Moscow. Founded in 862, Rostov \"the Great\" gives the impression of a sleepy village, spread out along the shore of the Lake Nero. From the dusty streets rise the white-washed walls and shiny domes of the Kremlin, a relic of the 12th Century, when Rostov was the seat of the Grand Prince. Climb up into the fortress walls, from where you can also enter the unusual gate-churches. Keep your ears pealed for a bell concert, which the resident monks play from the belfry of the Assumption Cathedral.",

        "content": "The iconic skyscraper has the highest and best views in the city, its history is revelatory and makeovers to the lobby and observatories deserve a fresh look. It is so obvious, so clich  and so visible that visiting the Empire State Building gets, ironically, overlooked. Like the single slice meal, blue Yankee cap and yellow cab, the skyscraper is in the city s DNA, so familiar you feel as if you have been there even if you have never stepped foot on the observation deck. Or maybe you have written it off as an over-priced tourist trap, which is not entirely off-base. But as the gray monolith turns 80 years old on May 1, it is worth giving it a second   or first   try. The Empire State Building inspires the imagination, its views are the highest and best in the city, its history revelatory, and makeovers to the lobby and observatories deserve a fresh look. All you need to do is avoid the headaches and traps of a visit so that nothing detracts from the marvel. Avoiding the lines There are four famously-lengthy lines (tickets, security, elevator up, elevator down) but there are just as many ways to avoid them. You can visit during more predictably crowd-free times, particularly between the 8 am opening and the pre-lunch rush, and after midnight until the 2 am close. For other times, call ahead. I scored a lineless visit on a Wednesday just before sunset by calling 212-736-3100 and asking for the wait time. If the estimate exceeds your patience you can purchase an Express Ticket for $24 extra and get the velvet rope treatment at the front of each line. Or, for only a $2 online fee, you can at least buy and print out the normal ticket in advance and avoid the ticket line, which is often the longest. With those hurdles leapt you are free to enjoy the gleaming lobby, nearly half a block of prime Art Deco design. The illuminated celestial-meets-industrial scene of gold and aluminium leaf spheres and lines, modern by 1930s standards, had been obscured for decades by florescent lights that were modern by '60s standards. Its recreated glory, accomplished by historical architects and artisans, is classic Gotham. It left me feeling woefully underdressed without a fedora and pinstripe suit. The bar The Empire Room, an old-school-styled cocktail lounge of mohair, velvet, ebony and embossed leather that opened last year, extends that retro feel. The vibe is reminiscent of the early '60s-set television show Mad Men, though the soundtrack alternated between appropriate Harry Connick Jr tunes and mood-shattering Sade and Queen remixes. The cocktail menu includes classics such as the Ramon Gin Fizz, Waldorf and Martinique Daisy, all elaborately and proficiently executed. The bar's signature drink is a sweet, bubbly variation on the Empire State Cocktail -- gin, vermouth, Royal Combier Liqueur, lemon juice and raspberry-orange marmalade crowned tableside in a chilled martini glass with Moet & Chandon champagne. As an aside to the bartender shaking mine out, one pearl-necklaced hostess characterized the concoction as \"stupid\". And while it is an admittedly convoluted, fruity concoction Don Draper would not be caught dead sipping, the champagne was a nice addition to the classic recipe. It gave me a fizzy rush that aped the ascent of the building's dizzying height.",

        "content": "Ancient Vijayanagara, a crumbling 16th-century metropolis, is a stark contrast to the decadence of Goa s beach life. Once the hippie paradise of the sixties, Goa s beautiful beaches are now overrun with endless hawkers and techno music. Last year, the Indian state broke its own tourism record. But just beyond the tourist trappings of the tightly packed beachfront development, lie the ruins of the opulent former southern capital of the spice trade. Ancient Vijayanagara, now known as the village of Hampi, is just a day's drive from the Goan chill-out scene. It is a stark contrast to the decadence of beach life. The rice fields and coconut plantations drop away into vast expanses of arid farmland, worked by men dressed in dhoties, driving oxen in their bare feet. Granite boulders litter the landscape, in hues of gold, pink and grey, a rocky backdrop to the sprawling ruins. The entire city was ransacked in the 16th Century, leaving behind one of the most important cultural and religious monuments in the region. This crumbling metropolis was once one of the most beautiful cities in its time. Today it is one of the most impressive ruins. This is why you go to India. Where to start? Most people stay in the area known as Hampi Bazaar, which is situated beside the main temple (Virupaksha), or they venture out to the neighbouring town of Hospet. The scale of Vijayanagara is not to be underestimated (26 square km of ruins), especially in the midday heat, so it is advisable to rent a bike, motorbike or hire a rickshaw driver as you cruise from temple to temple -- although it is possible to walk. The perfect two-day exploration The best way to quickly grasp the magnitude of Hampi is to hike Mantanga hill, preferably at sunrise for the best views. Stone steps are carved into the hillside and while it is the only way to experience the full gestalt of the city, it is still hard to imagine how invading Muslims could have spent six months attacking and pillaging the once thriving capital of 500,000 people. The comparison between what must have been and what exists today is a constant part of the experience in Hampi. From there, head to the main river that cuts through the town, the Tungabhadra, to watch pilgrims and locals bathe down by the ghats. Every morning at around eight, the loveliest thing happens. The temple elephant, Lakshmi, carefully lumbers down the long stairs to the river and blesses the pilgrims with a spray of water before receiving her morning bath. It takes about an hour to scrub her down and she lays on her side, poking her trunk up out of the water and adjusting her ears to allow her handlers better access. To start exploring the ruins, begin with the Ganesha temple, then work counter clockwise to the Krishna temple and the Badava Linga -- an emblem of the Hindu deity Shiva. From there, you can rest from the unrelenting slow bake of southern India in the cool, dark stone of the underground temple. Nearby, the Shiva temple is decorated with pillars carved with images of the deity. Next, you will see the Royal Enclosure, a loop of road with several sets of ruins, and beyond that, the Queen's bath, a faded building with sumptuously curved arches inside, surrounding a now empty bathing pool. In Hampi, the sunset is a spectator sport, attracting decent crowds to admire as the surrounding hills and boulders transform from washed out creams and greys into warm reds and oranges. Hours after the sun sets, the rocks still feel warm. Festivals occur several times throughout the year (January: Mahasankranti, February to March: Sivaratri and Holi, March to April: the celebration of the marriage of Virupaksha and Pampa with a chariot festival, November to December: the betrothal ceremony of Virupaksha and Pampa), and often at night, with drumming and dancing in the street and locals offering pujas in the main temple, Virupaksha. Depending on the time of year, there might be some combination of candle lighting, fireworks, an appearance by the temple elephant, Lakshmi, or a bonfire. While most of the sites are free, three charge for admittance. One ticket gets you into all three, but only within the same day, so it is cheaper to see them all at once. Vithalla is a large temple complex featuring a stunning 100-column hall, a large chariot-shaped shrine and several mandapas. It is shrouded in mystery as it was built after the destruction of the capital, but no one knows under what circumstances. Next is the Lotus Mahal, a symmetrical open-air pavilion which is one of the best preserved sites in Hampi. The gracefully arched building is framed by extensive grounds and a watchtower in the distance. Finally, the elephant stables, 12 chambers that would have fit two elephants each, now stand empty and silent. Before you go Because of the religious significance of the site, there is no alcohol served in Hampi, although it is possible to get it in neighbouring towns or across the river at certain guest houses. Also, when visiting temples, it is important to dress appropriately, which means covering up bare arms, shoulders and legs. And unlike Goa, Hampi is largely a vegetarian-only town, so do not be surprised to see a distinct lack of meat on many menus.",

In the remote countryside of central Vietnam, archaeologists discovered the \"longest monument in Southeast Asia\", a wall that winds through pristine, rain-forested mountains and hill tribe villages, yet still unspoiled by the imminent arrival of busloads of tourists. Find of the century Earlier this year, Vietnam's most important archaeological discovery in a century was announced by Dr Andrew Hardy, head of the Hanoi branch of  cole fran aise d'Extr me-Orient (French School of Asian Studies) and Dr Nguyen Tien Dong, from the Institute of Archaeology (Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences). The rampart stretches 127.4 km from northern Quang Ngai Province, south into the province of Binh Dinh, and is the greatest engineering feat of the Nguyen Dynasty. The Long Wall of Quang Ngai, as it is now known, is made of alternating sections of stone and earth, is believed to have been built in 1819 as a cooperative effort between the Vietnamese and H're ethnic minority. Much like Hadrian's Wall in the United Kingdom, Quang Ngai's wall was also built along an ancient, pre-existing road, and not only provided security but also regulated trade along the route. Most of the wall is still in relatively good condition, attaining heights up 4 metres. Quang Ngai today Until now, Quang Ngai was seldom visited by tourists, apart from stops at the Son My Memorial Museum, site of the infamous wartime My Lai Massacre. The province remained politically sensitive as a result of those tragic events, and as such, travel by outsiders through the countryside was somewhat restricted. Since the initial discovery of the wall in 2005, Quang Ngai has slowly opened up. Several independent travellers have now ventured to see the wall since its existence was announced earlier this year. Quang Ngai City, the provincial capital, is a suitable base from which visitors can reach the wall. Apart from the city's only four-star hotel, Central Hotel, near the river, the city lacks anything approaching luxury accommodation. Dining is mostly street food and local specialties like ram bap (corn spring rolls), ron (tiny river clam soup) and ca bong song tra (Song Tra River mudskipper fish). As no major tour companies have offices in Quang Ngai yet, transportation consists of Mai Linh taxis (one of the few legal and reliable companies) and motorbikes for hire.",

The site of the Civil War's most famous battle, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania has historic events year round, but this month kicks off a five-year commemoration with expanded programs and tours, special observances and the opening of a new museum. From April through October there will be living history encampments at several places around town. \"Kids can walk up and talk to soldiers -- Union and Confederate -- and ask about what they are wearing or what they are cooking for dinner,\" Mr Whitehill said. \"There will be large battle re-enactments and smaller skirmishes in the streets. That's one of the things we do best here.\" In Manassas, Virginia, \"cannons boom and rifles crackle\" too, as the pivotal Battle of First Manassas is recreated in July, but visitors to the area can also watch crafts demonstrations, listen to live music and learn dances of the Civil War era.

Travel back more than 700 years ago to Acre, and sample the delights of a cosmopolitan crusader outpost before it falls to the Mamluks, and get tips on visiting the present day Israeli city. When to go The Mamluk sultan of Egypt and Syria, Baybars Bunduqdari, has agreed a truce with the Christian forces in Outremer. Act now and take advantage of our incredible peacetime offers. The Christians may have lost Jerusalem back in 1244, but Acre has become the crusaders' hip and happening capital. Acre boasts a safe harbour and markets galore, and it's a veritable melting pot of races and religions. You never know who you might meet around the next corner: assassin or merchant, Knight Templar or slave trader. The truce has been agreed for ten years and ten months, but who knows what will happen when it ends, so don't delay - book today! What to take with you A decent pair of shoes are essential if you take the overland route across Christendom, then down through Anatolia and Cilicia - though frankly that's so First Crusade. Besides, all the cities worth looting, such as Constantinople, have already been pillaged by your forefathers, so we highly recommend a sea crossing in this day and age. It's peacetime so you shouldn't need a weapon, but you might find a broadsword comforting if you can afford one - the threat of internecine war is never far away in this multicultural port. Costs and money Another good reason to book now is that your stay will be more economically viable in peacetime. Trade is thriving, with the Italian maritime republics selling arms and timber for siege engines to the Mamluks in Egypt - and the markets are overflowing with produce, meaning a lower risk of profiteering. Don't forget: during the siege of Acre by the crusaders at the end of the 12th century the price of a sack of grain rose to 100 gold pieces and many besiegers had to live on horse entrails and bark. This might be fine if you're French, but since our delicate British stomachs can't even cope with raw fruit, you'd be strongly advised to give this siege cuisine a wide berth. See Take a stroll down the vaulted streets and covered marketplaces in the Pisan and Venetian quarters and marvel at the wares: indigo from Iraq, glass from Egypt, perfume from Syria, or sugar from Acre's own factory. Smell the aromas of a thousand spices, eye the poisons on display, hear the many languages being shouted by traders. If shopping isn't your thing then head outside the walls and wander through the gardens and orchards, or take a day trip to the Springs of the Oxen, where Adam is said to have found the beasts with which to plough the earth.

        "content": "As I watch him go, with his red nylon cape flapping out behind him, he looks more John Cleese than Julius Caesar, and it strikes me that many of our associations with ancient Rome are comic. But walk the path for any distance, and as the wall unfolds in front of you, it reveals a past that was also epic, poignant and strange. I d begun my walk the day before, heading east from Lanercost in Cumbria. It s my plan to walk the 40-mile stretch to Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland over four days. I set off early in the morning as a man called Maurice brings out the honesty box from his shed to set beside his bag of home-grown apples. Munching on one of Maurice s apples as I walk past the first standing remnant of the wall at Hare Hill, I find it hard to reconcile the peaceful atmosphere around me with what I know of the region s history. Ripe sloes and crab apples line the path that runs along green pasture where sheep and cattle graze happily in the soft rain. Hadrian ordered the construction of his wall in 122 AD;  to separate the Romans from the barbarians , his biographer wrote. It stretched in its heyday from coast to coast, with a pair of turrets and a  castle  or small fort every mile, and deep earthworks on either side. Larger forts, some of which predated the wall, garrisoned the troops and housed their dependants. Until antiquarians began to realise the significance of Hadrian s Wall and fought to preserve it in the 19th century, it was pillaged by locals for building material. Along its length, farmhouses that have been built out of Roman masonry still sit next to denuded sections of the wall. All the same, according to Richard Hingley, a Durham archaeologist who s writing a biography of the wall, locals never entirely forgot its importance. It helped define the border between England and Scotland. And as early as the 16th century, local landowners were collecting stones from the wall to display in their gardens. Nowadays, much of the wall is gone; sections of it are no more than dots and dashes of stonework. At the eastern edge of the route, slabs of wall turn up incongruously in Tyneside housing estates. Every now and again, you come upon a stretch that is sufficiently intact to give you a sense of what it must have been like during the centuries when it was Rome s northern frontier. Ruts cut by hundreds of years of wagon wheels can be seen in the stone gateways of forts. Here and there are stones carved by the soldiers to commemorate the completion of their work:  the cohort of Primus Pilus built this  scratched into a stone, or a phallus etched into a limestone block to propitiate a forgotten god.",

        "content": "Linger over an espresso where Kafka, Einstein and V clav Havel gained caffeinated inspiration. There is an old story about Lenin, set in the gilded splendour of a caf  somewhere in Central Europe, sometime in the early 20th Century. A pair of distinguished old gentlemen are discussing affairs of state over steaming cups of coffee and slices of cake.  There s talk of revolution,  says one, moustache quivering.  Any day now, they say.  \"Revolution!\" scoffs the second, cocking his thumb at the next table, where a scrawny young man with a goatee beard and flat cap is scribbling furiously in a notebook. \"And who's going to lead it - him???\" The tale is almost certainly apocryphal. But sitting in Prague's art deco Caf  Imperial, scooping the whipped cream off a v de sk  k va (Viennese coffee), it is an evocative fantasy. The future Soviet leader did visit Prague, in 1912. In fact, it was at the Prague Party Conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, held just around the corner in Hybernsk  street, that his Bolshevik faction broke away from the Mensheviks for good, with untold consequences for humanity. Unfortunately the Imperial was not built until 1914, so there goes the Lenin theory. But with its creamy tiles and Moorish mosaics, it is still a great place to sit and watch the world - and the trams - go by, though the prices are no longer revolutionary. Like many Prague coffee houses, the Caf  Imperial has undergone something of a makeover in recent years. Gone is the dark and dismal interior, the indifferent service, and - a terrible shame this - the legendary doughnut bowl, whose stale contents could once be bought and pelted at fellow patrons for exactly 1,942 Czech crowns (just over 100 dollars), a homage to an incident in the classic 1942 novel Saturnin, a sort of Czech Jeeves and Wooster. The Imperial is one of a handful of the great pre-war caf s - temples to caffeine, creativity and conversation - left in Prague. You wll find two of the most famous on the city's N rodn  street. The first, Caf  Louvre, boasts a beautifully-preserved interactive map in the marbled lobby, displaying the unfeasibly long list of caf s (160!) that served the Czech capital before war, Communism and Starbucks intervened. Each is marked with a little bulb that lights up when you press a button. Most, sadly, are long gone. But the Louvre, with its pastel pink decor and excellent sweet trolley, survives to this day, its genteel ambience unchanged since 1911, when Einstein, then a visiting professor, would pop in for a piece of strudel.",

And you don t have to bring coins   in fact, watch out for speculative money changers. It s better to bring uncoined silver or other goods to barter, because you will want to make your offerings to the gods for good luck   and maybe buy your own private water supply too. Sleep You shouldn t expect 5-star accommodation at any price, unless you happen to be a VIP, an ambassador or someone like that. Do remember there could be as many as 40,000 of you crammed together in a small space at the height of summer   darlings, the smell FUN AND (THE) GAMES But every four years, at the second full moon after the summer solstice, Olympia itself   as well as the athletes of course   really jumps. If you arrive a bit early, you can watch potential competitors in training, hoping to be selected for their chosen events on the big day. The full programme includes sprint and middle distance running, the  heavy  events: boxing, wrestling, all-in fighting; and field events: discus, javelin, doesn t even bear thinking about. So whatever you do, don t forget the aryballos (perfume-fl ask) or sponge. Eat and drink But there will be compensations, believe me, many and various. Lots of temporary stall holders offering sweetmeats and alcoholic beverages, not to mention other more, shall we say, fleshly delights. (When I said  no women allowed , I meant no free Greek citizen women, naturally). See Some of you may have already visited Olympia off-season. To you I say that you are in for a big surprise. Some of the buildings are lovely, no doubt, any year, any time of year   the temple of Hera, for instance (but it so needs a temple to the patron god Zeus to go with it, don t you think?), and there are lots of gorgeous statues to gaze at. But frankly there s not a lot else to do   apart from consult Zeus s oracle, say, or pay your pious respects to the host of other gods and heroes who have their shrines and altars here. Fun and (the) games But every four years, at the second full moon after the summer solstice, Olympia itself   as well as the athletes of course   really jumps. If you arrive a bit early, you can watch potential competitors in training, hoping to be selected for their chosen events on the big day. The full programme includes sprint and middle distance running, the  heavy  events: boxing, wrestling, all-in fighting; and field events: discus, javelin, long-jump. All the competitors are stark naked too   gymnasia are just what they say they are:  stark-naked training-grounds . And on top of all that there are the equestrian events: horseracing, mule-cart racing, chariot-racing. With any luck you might see a spectacular chariot wreck. Of course the equestrian events are only for the rich   who sponsor the teams, the jockeys and the drivers. They don t actually compete in person, but they get lots of kudos anyway. Poor boys can do very well in the running or boxing, mind you   and can then cash in on their success later on. But remember that all that victors at Olympia win is a symbolic prize of a crown of wild olive. You, though, will make heroes of them and you can rub shoulders with them in the huge parade and animal-sacrifice at Zeus s massive ash-altar that mark the festival s central act of communion between gods and men. Getting around When you get home   by mule-cart for some of you, on horseback for the lucky few, but for most on foot   you can worship the victors, literally, as superhuman heroes. That is even (or especially) if they ve got themselves killed, in the all-in fighting or whatever. Errosthe (fare well)! Visiting Olympia today One of the most delightful of Greece s ancient sites, Olympia is today a day trip from Athens. That it is a glorious one rather than a hot, underwhelming slog is to do with two things: the efforts locals and firefighters made in 2007 to save the site from bush fires, and the ruins themselves.",

        "content": "Stonehenge is the most famous of the 1,000 stone circles across Britain. Explore two more historic stone circles in Orkney and Cumbria. Stonehenge is, for many of us, the one place that represents Britain s prehistory. The celebrated stone circle standing proud on Salisbury Plain with its trademark lintel-topped sarsens has been an enduring source of fascination for millennia. The first monument there, a circular ditch and bank, was dug in c2900 BC, and a timber or stone circle erected inside it. Then, much later, in c2400 BC, the first monoliths of local rock were brought in. Over the course of the next several hundred years, stones were put up, taken down, moved around, added to, and then finally re-erected to the shape we see today. Stonehenge is undeniably a stone circle, but it's not a henge, even though it has lent its name to the group of monuments that go under that title. The concept of the 'henge' was introduced by a man called Thomas Kendrick in 1932 and technically, a henge is a circular earthen bank with a ditch inside it and one or more entrances through the bank. At Stonehenge, there is a circular bank, but it is inside a ditch, so these elements are the wrong way round. Nevertheless, stone circles and henges do appear to be connected parts of a tradition that developed in Britain from around 3000 to 2000 BC - in other words, during the later Neolithic period (when agriculture began here) and moving into the earlier Bronze Age (when we see the first use of metals, from about 2400 BC). Stone circles are often positioned within henges, sometimes in replacement for earlier timber circles, so there is a link between the two types of monument, though it's not an absolutely clear one, as Richard Bradley explains: \"Henges and stone circles are separate things that often coalesce. You've got plenty of stone circles that don't have henges, and plenty of henges that don't have stone circles. They each can pursue an independent existence but they are both different expressions of a more basic idea that special places ought to be circular, which seems quite natural to us, but large parts of Europe don't have circular monuments in prehistory.\"",

Walking through a wintry Harbin is like falling through the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland and landing in a fairytale. The 27th Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival in this north-eastern Chinese city is the biggest ever, an incredible demonstration of the same industrial-scale creativity that was on display at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. The riverfront and streets are lined with hundreds of intricate ice sculptures, including a full-size replica of a Disney castle. At night, lit by multi-coloured lasers and lanterns, the effect is magical. This year's festival also sees Harbin reclaim its past, via a frozen re-creation of the St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church. A legacy of the time before World War II when the city was home to 100,000 Russians, the church was destroyed in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. \"For my parents' generation, that sculpture brings back many memories,\" says Zhang Qingying, a local lawyer. More than a million visitors are expected to attend this year's festival, as Harbin establishes itself as China's winter-sports playground. The nearby ski resort of Yabuli, the country's biggest, is being upgraded and extended, a sign of how China's burgeoning middle classes are increasingly taking to the slopes, while rumour has it that Harbin is a frontrunner to host the 2022 Winter Olympics.

        "content": "Not far from Poland s capital are two historical sites, the Wieliczka salt mine and the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum, both of which transport travelers to a different time. Not far, but worlds away from the unending charm of Krak w, are two of Poland s most cherished sites. Both are Unesco heritage listed. Both attract dense crowds each day and both are portals to alternate realms of experience. The Wieliczka salt mine is 10km from Krak w and descends 327m underground. The Auschwitz-Birkenau museum is 40km from Krak w, and descends into one of the darkest crevices of human history. Wieliczka Salt Mine The Wieliczka Salt Mine is an intricate ant-farm of passages, chambers and underground lakes, distributed over nine levels. Enormous cavities dug or discovered by miners and explorers since the 13th Century interlink to form an underground city with bulging grey boulders for clouds and bible-black tunnels for roads. Less than 1% of the mine's 300km is open for public exploration, but this tiny fraction is large enough to include restaurants, chapels and halls that regularly host balls, art exhibitions, music concerts and even soccer tournaments. The three hour journey through the spooky labyrinth of chambers and corridors begins after a dizzying descent down a wooden scaffold of 380 steps tattooed all over with \"I was here\" scratchings. Down here, internal compasses are thrown off-course. As you clamber up and down skewed staircases and along imperceptible gradients, you lose all sense of how far you are trespassing below normal human habitation. The zenith of the salt mine's underground experience is the Chapel of St Kinga, the first glimpse of which shocks reverence into even the most devout atheist. The intricate details of the altarpieces, frescoes, chandeliers and tiled floors in this 54m long, 12m high place of worship are all the more impressive for having been meticulously hand carved entirely from salt over 30 painstaking years.",

These are the stark realities that confront visitors to sites of genocide, torture and atrocity. The horrors of Nazi concentration camps in Poland or the Khmer Rouge s Killing Fields in Cambodia can be taught in history books, but nothing comes close to the feeling of standing in the very place millions of people fell victim to evil. \"There's something about [it] that draws you into their reality in a way that's vivid and personal,\" said Sara Bloomfield, director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. \"And that just doesn't match any other form of learning... These places teach us that the unthinkable is thinkable,\" she said. Preservation efforts in Poland are currently underway to ensure the protection of the decaying Auschwitz-Birkenau site and its victims' memories. This is good news for the country's tourism industry which sees a great deal of business from both foreign and local visitors to the Nazi death camp. Tourism, though, often brings with it some level of commercialization. In locations of atrocities around the world, tourists and tourism companies must ask themselves: when does tourism walk the line between education and exploitation? Youk Chhang was just a child when he was separated from his family and forced into slave labour in the Killing Fields. Although he and his mother survived the Khmer Rhouge's reign, several of their relatives did not. Chhang now runs the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an organization that works to document the terrors of the Khmer Rouge. \"How can we learn from [this] history... so that it cannot be repeated, if we continue to fail to understand that the memory of those who have died cannot be commercialized?\" he said in an email to BBC Travel. Sites of atrocities, he believes, \"should not be sites to attract tourists, but places for them to learn\". Chhang fears that private companies coming into Cambodia are turning the Killing Fields into \"Disneylands\", as he told the Associated Press in 2006. He worries that resorts and casinos built near these sites may profit from the memory of genocide victims.",

        "content": "Follow young Henry VIII s favourite, and notorious, spots around the city. For centuries, King Henry VIII was mainly remembered as an obese Pope-hater with a penchant for executing anything that moved, especially if it was married to him. But the revival of interest in Tudor-era London, inspired by the success of the recent drama series The Tudors, has also transformed Henry s portly image in unexpected ways. He is now a sex symbol. Jonathan Rhys Meyers's young Henry is a suave lothario, prowling the streets of Tudor London in pursuit of his next mistress. And the city itself, portrayed in the series as a seething cesspit of murder, intrigue and passion, more than lives up to its ruler's charisma. While much has inevitably changed since Henry's reign, the outline of Tudor London is still visible within the sprawl of the modern city. The obvious place to start is at the Tower of London (www.hrp.org.uk/toweroflondon), sitting ominously on the edge of today's financial district. Previously used as a royal residence, Henry transformed it into a death-row prison. His second wife, Anne Boleyn, was executed here in 1536. Visitors can see the royal Crown Jewels and graffiti purported to have been scratched into the wall by the nine-day Queen, Lady Jane Grey, beheaded in 1554. Henry's bloodlust was matched only by his love for opulent palaces. The Thames was lined with the turrets of royal residences, from the Palace of Whitehall - whose only remaining section, the Banqueting House, is at the corner of Horse Guards Avenue (hrp.org.uk/banquetinghouse) - to Hampton Court in Richmond (www.hrp.org.uk/hamptoncourtpalace). Here, no less than five Henry VIII impersonators are on hand to show visitors around the King's Apartments, Tudor kitchens and the notoriously tricky maze. The young Henry's favourite Palace, however, was at Greenwich, where he held lavish parties and jaunting contests. The Palace was demolished in the 17th Century, but its remains continue to be found - a section of the tiled floor of the Tudor chapel was discovered in 2006. Artefacts from the Palace are on display at the \"Discover Greenwich\" visitor centre (www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org/discover-greenwich), which also offers the chance to try on a suit of Tudor armour.",

Though privately owned today, the Boulderado maintains much of its 1909 look, with antique furniture and the original cherry wood staircase. The hotel even operates its original Otis elevator, which a staff member must manually operate between floors. Past guests include Robert Frost and Helen Keller. Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong also found rooms here in the 1960s when few Boulder hotels accepted black guests.

But Penrose was no stuffy entrepreneur. A fierce anti-prohibitionist, he invited 55 New York hoteliers out west in 1920 and asked them to bring five bottles of their favorite \"cologne\". Today, you can admire Bottle Alley on the lobby level of the hotel and see the remains of what his conspirators imbibed during Prohibition; some bottles have their original dust. The Broadmoor remains dedicated to indulgence, featuring opulent chandeliers, marbled floors and detailed ceiling and wall murals.

        "content": "Travel back in time with stops in a merchant trading port and a historical Swahili city. Most travellers start exploring the coast from Mombasa. Historically, Portuguese, Indian, Persian and Arab traders used this port as their starting point for accessing East Africa. This jumble of merchants and explorers helped create the ethnic mix of Mombasa s population and the physical chaos of the city s layout. Here, a long stretch of Chinese-built concrete boxes; there, a mosque built by a nostalgic imam from Tunis in the style of his North African home; around the way, a series of souks, alleys and cobblestone walkways thick enough for a donkey to pass through, overhung with canvas to protect Gujarati candy merchants and Digo witch doctors from the white equatorial sun. And dominating the entire city is Fort Jesus, a castle made of coral by colonizing Portuguese. Mombasa can be dangerous to walk around after hours, but when the sun rises we recommend eating a breakfast of maharagwe (beans cooked with coconut) and chapatti bread. The ubiquitous foodstuff on the Kenyan coast is a synthesis of local and foreign ingredients. The adventure of the Kenyan coast is unfortunately matched by the ugliest sort of overdevelopment in the form of full-service Swahili-chic resorts. But smart, sustainable tourism projects exist as well, even in places chok-a-block with large hotels like popular Diani Beach. For example, the Colobus Trust (www.colobustrust.org) resembles a jungle playground, overhanging with vines and ropes, all a set piece and sanctuary for the adorable Angolan Black-and-White Colobus monkey. Further south of Diani, Kaya Kinondo (kaya-kinondo-kenya.com) is the protected kaya, or sacred forest, of the local Digo Mijikenda tribe.

        "content": "From forts to temples, the island s colonial and Buddhist heritage is rich and varied. Think of Sri Lanka and, aside from images of Tamil Tiger strife, it might be hard to picture anything except palm trees, azure seas and sumptuous white sand beaches. And it is true that sinking into the sands of Mirissa or Bentota, you might be tempted to do little more strenuous than ordering a Lion lager for the remainder of your stay. But if you can summon the energy to wrest yourself from its sandy southern reaches, there is more to see than sea on this stellar island, whose architectural heritage is as rich and varied as its boutique hotels  fine dining menus. The obvious first step on a Sri Lanka architectural itinerary is the 17th-century walled Galle Fort, one of seven Unesco World Heritage sites on the island, and set just steps away from those glorious beaches on the south coast. Originally founded in the 16th Century by the Portuguese, work commenced in earnest on the fort in 1663 under Dutch colonial rule, when it became the country's primary port. Its maritime significance seeped away once Sri Lanka was ceded to the British in 1796, but the fort today, comprising 36 seafront hectares, remains part of a living, working city. Admire its architecture simply by wandering the streets, before taking a trip out to examine the 19th-century frescoes at the nearby Kataluwa Purvarama Mahavihara Buddhist temple, nestled in dense forest and originally built in the 13th Century. For stunning views out over both fort and sea, return to complete a full round of the Galle Fort walls at dusk, then replenish with tasty fusion cuisine at the Galle Fort Hotel, once a gem of a merchant's mansion. Travelling upcountry to Kandy, the green hill country heart of Sri Lanka, the architectural legacy moves from colonial to religious, with Buddhist structures in abundance. Step in line with numerous pilgrims in Kandy's Unesco-rated Sacred City to visit the Dalada Maligawa, also known as the Temple of the Tooth and home to the country's most important Buddhist relic - allegedly a tooth of the Buddha. Then, to peruse the city's colonial past (it fell to the British in 1815) ramble the lanes of the British Garrison Cemetery, whose deaths, detailed on carved Victorian headstones and including sun stroke, jungle fever and rampaging elephants, paint a fascinating picture of colonial perils. Slightly farther afield, Sri Lanka's so-called \"cultural triangle\" - comprising the area bounded by Kandy, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa - hosts Sri Lanka's most celebrated archaeological and cultural sites, and four more of its Unesco World Heritage sites. Ponder civilisations long-past at Polonnaruwa, home to the ruins of a 12th-century ruler's elaborate garden city; gape at the remains of the 5th-century city of Sigiriya, built into and atop a massive granite peak. Explore the palaces and monasteries of the Sacred City of Polonnaruwa, and wander the mural-filled cave monastery of Dambulla. And even back on the south coast, hidden behind the heat and horn-honking of Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, you will also find a trove of architectural treasures, many legacies of the country's melting-pot religious heritage. Savour the century old, candy-striped Jami-Ul-Alfa Mosque, explore the 19th-century Kelaniya Raja Mahar Vihara Buddhist temple, visit the Sri Kailawasanathar Swami Devasthanam Hindu temple - the oldest in town - then look in on the shrine of St. Anthony's Church, where devotees stand in line to deposit offerings to its Technicolor shrines. Meanwhile, for something more modern, detour to the Lionel Wendt Centre to examine the contemporary art on display, then, come nightfall, see the light-dressed silhouettes of the Seema Malakaya on Beira Lake, two island pavilions designed in 1985, one filled with bronze Thai Buddhas and the other centred around a sacred bodhi tree.",

For the last 1,200 years, the Unesco World Heritage city of Santiago de Compostela has best been known as a pilgrimage destination for devout Catholics. Last year alone, nearly 500,000 faithful hikers set out along the series of well-trodden trails called \"the Camino\", journeying through the lush wooded hills and river-flecked valleys of Galicia in north-west Spain to reach the city's towering Romanesque cathedral. For years, I'd heard about Santiago's beauty from friends and fellow travellers who had gazed upon its towering church spires and twisting honey-coloured lanes. Yet, one of the great ironies is that many of those who had walked for weeks or even months to get there admitted that once they arrived, they shuffled alongside the masses into the cathedral to see the tomb of St James, slumped into one of the many touristy tapas bars around Rua Franco and then quickly headed home. If they had just taken a few more steps, I'd always wondered, would they have discovered more? I wanted to dig deeper into the city's medieval and more modern heart, but I didn't have the time or energy to trek the demanding trail myself. Fortunately, a high-speed rail route now whisks travellers across the nation to Santiago, giving visitors a blister-free way to explore one of Spain's most stunning   and under-explored   cities.

From the moment the Pilgrims stepped ashore at Plymouth Rock, this area was on the map   both geographically and historically. Today, the towns surrounding Boston include destinations that represent some of the most poignant pieces of the nation s history. The new nation was a seafaring one, amassing great wealth from ship-building, whaling, fishing and maritime trade. These industries were based in towns including Salem and Gloucester, which honor their heydays with national historic parks. Not that the region around Boston is living in the past. Today these satellites of the Hub have lively art scenes, including the world famous Peabody Essex Museum in Salem and the Rocky Neck artist colony in Gloucester. Miles of pristine coastline draw beachcombers and sunbathers (not to mention piping plovers). Hikers and bikers, canoeists and kayakers, bird-watchers and whale-watchers will have myriad opportunities to engage in the active lifestyle. So get on the bus, catch a train, rent a car or saddle up your bike. But by all means, get out of town. A day will allow you to explore Salem, located 20 miles northeast of Boston, at a leisurely pace. Salem burned itself an infamous place in history with the1692 hysteria that put innocent people to death for witchcraft.

You can take in an art tour or concert in spruced-up Mexico City, attend the huge Bicentennial Expo in Guanajuato, or (and this is perhaps the most exciting of all for us history nerds) you can plan a journey along routes that follow in the lives and military campaigns of Mexico's founding heroes and revolutionaries. The official government bicentennial website provides the tools: interactive and downloadable maps and historical information. One of these routes, called La Ruta del la Libertad (\"The Liberty Route\") follows the movements and campaigns of the founder of Mexico's Independence, the balding, unorthodox priest and rebel visionary Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. This itinerary will not only take you along the same journeys as Mexico's most revered hero and his co-rebels, but through its most beloved and historically important heartland towns.

        "title": "Abu Simbel: The great temple of Egypt",
        "content": "The Great Temple of Ramses II was rediscovered two hundred years ago, carved out of a mountain on the Niles  banks. The structure is a shrine to the pharaoh and primeval Egyptian gods. In his day, Ramses II built entire cities, but nothing would have been as awe-inspiring as the Great Temple which was stumbled across in the depths of the Egyptian desert near the border of Nubia, buried under centuries of sand. No temple has such ancient, in-built heart and soul, and none have matched its passionate, modern-day story of discovery and rescue. The Great Temple was first carved out of the mountain on the west bank of the Nile between 1274 and 1244BC, Ramses II's imposing temple was as much dedicated to the deified pharaoh himself as to the primeval Egyptian gods Ra-Horakhty, Amun and Ptah. Over the centuries both the Nile and the desert sands imperceptibly shifted, and this temple was lost to the world until 1813, when it was accidentally rediscovered by the Swiss explorer Jean-Louis Burckhardt. The four colossal statues of the pharaoh fronting the temple were like gigantic sentinels watching over the incoming traffic from the south, undoubtedly designed as a warning to the strength of the pharaoh. When the temple was discovered, nearly 200 years ago, only one of the heads was completely showing above the sand, the next head was broken off and, of the remaining two, only the crowns could be seen. Enough sand was cleared away in 1817 by Giovanni Belzoni for the temple to be entered. However, by the end of the century, plans were afoot to dam the Nile and it looked as though the Great Temple was doomed to be buried again, although on this occasion its coverage was intended to be water. As the plans for the High Dam were drawn up, worldwide attention focused on the many valuable and irreplaceable ancient monuments that would be destroyed by the waters of Lake Nasser. Between 1960 and 1980 the Unesco-sponsored Nubian Rescue Campaign gathered expertise and financing from more than 50 countries, and sent Egyptian and foreign archaeological teams to Nubia. Necropolises were excavated, all portable artefacts and relics were removed to museums and, while some temples disappeared beneath the lake, 14 were salvaged. Ten of them, including the temple complexes of Philae, Kalabsha and Abu Simbel, were dismantled stone by stone and painstakingly rebuilt on higher ground. Four others were donated to the countries that contributed to the rescue effort, including the splendid Temple of Dendur, now reconstructed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Perhaps the greatest achievement of all was the preservation of the temples at Abu Simbel. Ancient magnificence and skill met with equally impressive modern technology as, at a cost of about $40 million, Egyptian, Italian, Swedish, German and French archaeological teams cut the temples up into more than 2,000 huge blocks, weighing from 10 to 40 tonnes each, and reconstructed them inside an artificially built mountain, 210m away from the water and 65m higher than the original site. The temples were carefully oriented to face the original direction, and the landscape of their original environment was re-created on and around the concrete, dome-shaped mountain. The project took just over four years. The temples of Abu Simbel were officially reopened in 1968 while the sacred site they had occupied for more than 3,000 years disappeared beneath Lake Nasser. A plaque to the right of the temple entrance eloquently describes this achievement: \"Through this restoration of the past, we have indeed helped to build the future of mankind.\" In October every year, the first rays of the rising sun reach across the Nile, penetrate the temple and move along the hypostyle hall, through the vestibule and into the sanctuary, where they illuminate the somewhat mutilated figures of Ra-Horakhty, Ramses II and Amun. Ptah is never illuminated. Before the temple was moved, this would occur one day earlier. The article 'Abu Simbel: The great temple of Egypt' was published in partnership with Lonely Planet.",

The Dubai Museum is a must-see attraction in Dubai, not only for the ancient building in which it is housed, but also for its engaging exhibits. The museum's collection vividly charts Dubai's rapid progress from a tiny pre-oil fishing and pearling village - and one of the world's first free-trade ports - through to the Arabian metropolis it is today. A couple of hours spent here before exploring the rest of Dubai really help give a sense of the city's speed of evolution. Housed in the majestic Al-Fahidi Fort, built to defend Dubai Creek around 1787, it is the oldest building in the area. The structure is made from sea rocks and gypsum, and served as both residence to Dubai's rulers and the seat of government until 1971, when it became a museum. Its manageable size and entertaining exhibits give you a quick and comprehensive introduction to Dubai's history, culture and traditions. Apart from the kitsch dioramas and disturbingly lifelike mannequins, highlights include finds from the Al-Qusais archaeological site dating back to between 2500 BC and 500 BC. Visitors enjoy posing with the disconcertingly lifelike mannequins in the museum's whimsical dioramas. Leading the Bedouin's beloved beast of burden seems to be the most popular photo opportunity, but try to resist playing Indiana Jones with the safari-suited archaeologists. The long-suffering guards have given up trying to stop people posing for photos with the kitsch mannequins - so fire away. In the fort's courtyard are several small wooden boats and traditional barasti (palm-leaf) houses, including the primitive Al Kaimah, and the summerhouse Al Areesh with traditional wind-tower (barajeel) \"air conditioning\". Step inside and test it out - you'll really notice the difference if visiting on a balmy day. Within the fort's walls are fascinating weapon displays featuring beautiful old silver khanjars (curved daggers) with camel-bone decoration, and swords inscribed with calligraphy. You will also find exhibits on traditional Emirati dances and musical instruments. Don't miss the shekhlelah, a skirt hung with goat's hooves that makes music when you shake your hips. The real treats are found in the underground museum exhibits beneath the fort, featuring a multimedia presentation on Dubai's extraordinary development through the series of dioramas brought to life by excellent use of audio and hologram-like video projections. The vivid scenes represent life in the souq, Islam, education, social life, architecture, costumes and jewellery, the desert and oasis, water and survival, and the popular \"underwater\" sea exhibition.

        "title": "Helmut Schmidt: Germany s Anglophile Chancellor",
        "content": "On 5 July 1957 the Bundestag voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Treaties of Rome, which are still at the heart of today s European Union. Not all Germany s parliamentarians played along. The young Helmut Schmidt   a brash, chain-smoking Social Democrat from Hamburg   refused to support the Treaties, largely because of British non-participation.  Much as I was convinced of the necessity of European integration , he later reflected,  I then thought   that the EEC could never be successful in the absence of British experience and pragmatism.  At the time, Schmidt   who later became West German chancellor from 1974 to 1982   reflected the views of many continental politicians who looked for British help and leadership in the rebuilding of Europe. Born in 1918 and growing up in the port city of Hamburg, Schmidt had been exposed to British life and culture from an early age: his first trip abroad had been a three-week school exchange to Manchester in July 1932. In the immediate postwar years, Schmidt s political socialisation was decisively furthered by the British regional commissioner in Hamburg, Sir Vaughan Berry, who frequently initiated informal Anglo-German tea parties with politically interested young locals. Such contacts were part of the reason why Schmidt soon acquired a reputation as an unabashed  Atlanticist , who prioritised the Federal Republic s links to the Anglo-American world over Franco-German relations. On the eve of Schmidt s election in May 1974, the British Foreign Office predicted golden times for the British-German relationship, hoping that Schmidt s Germany might align itself more closely with Britain rather than France. Such hopes were misguided. During his eight years in office, Schmidt developed an exceptionally close partnership with the French President Val ry Giscard d Estaing, which resulted in major European initiatives, such as the creation of the European Council and the European Monetary System. Britain, by contrast, often seemed aloof from and dejected by this revitalised Franco-German axis, as Schmidt clashed heavily and repeatedly with his British counterparts, such as Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher, over key issues of EC politics. In later years, he appeared scornful about Britain s supposedly destructive role in the European politics of the 1970s, explaining Wilson s and Thatcher s sceptical attitude towards the EC through a more general British Euroscepticism, allegedly ingrained in British history and culture.  The Queen, the Commonwealth and the special relationship with the US is much more important than Europe , he asserted in one of his last interviews in December 2013, exclaiming that de Gaulle had been  right  in vetoing British membership during the 1960s. What changed? Yet, the real story of the British-German relationship during Schmidt s years in office is more complicated than his clich -laden recollections suggest. At the heart of Schmidt s frequent clashes with his British counterparts was not a seemingly eternal British aversion to all things European, as Schmidt would have it. The history of British-German relations under Schmidt is not one of unilateral obstructionism, but one of mutual misperceptions and misunderstandings, which can be explained by the two countries  different paths towards the European integration process after 1945. Gold Conference of Finance Ministers of the EEC countries: the UK s Denis Healey, West Germany s Helmut Schmidt and the Nethertlands  Wim Duisenberg, by Rob Mieremet, 22 April 1974. Nationaal Archief. Public Domain. Many of the deeper reasons behind the frequent bilateral clashes over Europe in the 1970s can be found in the decades prior to Schmidt s chancellorship. His initial Anglophilia was certainly sincere. In the early 1960s, he even wrote a couple of highly polemical newspaper articles in which he criticised the French and German governments for pushing ahead with the European integration process without British involvement:  Hitler also underestimated England , one headline read. As Schmidt rose through Germany s political ranks in the 1960s, however, he started to approach the European question from a more strategic angle, which made him realise the paramount importance of France to the European project. Much like Konrad Adenauer, West Germany s first chancellor, Schmidt now argued that his country s exposed geostrategic location at the centre of Europe and its unique historical burden made it a strategic necessity to embed its postwar foreign policy firmly into a multilateral European framework, thereby making Germany s political and economic resurgence palatable to its neighbours. The relationship with France, Schmidt came to believe, was the foundation for Germany s postwar rehabilitation. By the mid-1960s, Schmidt had therefore reversed his position on British EC membership almost completely.  Given its particular interests and its resulting tight bonds to France , he wrote at the time of Britain s second EC application in 1967, German simply could not  act as a battering ram and immediately open up the door to the EC for the English by exercising pressure on Paris . But it was a position determined by Schmidt s calculating head rather than his Anglophile heart: the EC was imaginable without Britain; it was unimaginable without France. A difficult role to define The British perspective on postwar European integration was rather different. In the 1950s, British reactions to the various integration initiatives contemplated on the continent had ranged from indifference to hostility: perhaps for them, but definitely not for us. Instead, Britain s postwar strategy was based on consolidating and maintaining the country s global role: not without reason, when roughly half of its trade was still conducted with the Commonwealth. Confronted with the country s postwar decline and facing the realities of a rapidly emerging European trading bloc on the continent, however, Britain s political leaders soon changed their minds and applied twice for EEC membership: under Harold Macmillan in 1961-3 and Harold Wilson in 1967. But these applications were driven largely by negative motivations: if you can t beat them, join them. The subsequent vetoes by de Gaulle added insult to injury, leaving Britain without a progressive European policy for much of the 1960s. When Britain eventually joined the EC in January 1973, it therefore had to define its role in an institutional framework that had already consolidated itself and to accept rules and mechanisms that often seemed ill-suited to Britain s interests and preferences. By the time of Schmidt s election in May 1974, then, British and German attitudes towards the EC had evolved very differently over two decades. For 1970s Germany, EC membership had come to signify the country s postwar political and economic rehabilitation; for Britain, by contrast, it seemed to symbolise the country s postwar decline and transformation into a medium-sized European power. It did not help that Britain joined the EC on the eve of a global economic crisis, with rapidly rising food prices and double-digit inflation dominating much of Britain s first decade inside the EC. Membership was not the economic panacea various governments had portrayed it to be. Helmut Schmidt, 9 July 1982. Nationaal Archief. Public Domain. These factors pointed to future problems for the British-German relationship under Schmidt. He may have wrapped his personal attachment to the European integration process in less idealistic language than most, but he had nonetheless become firmly attached to the EC as the major strategic framework for Germany s postwar rehabilitation. That is why he reacted strongly whenever he felt the EC s cohesion or past achievements were under threat. British leaders, by contrast, lacked a comparably powerful imperative for EC membership. They approached the issue from a much more transactional and, at times, openly antagonistic angle   even if it meant prolonged crises with their European partners. Take Wilson s  renegotiation & referendum  ploy in 1974-5, for example. From Wilson s perspective, it was a clever strategy to appease the formidable anti-EC wing of his Labour Party while, in the long run, ensuring Britain s continuing membership. To Schmidt, however, Wilson s approach seemed like a cynical prioritisation of narrow party political interests at the expense of his European partners. That is why he ganged up with Giscard to ensure that the renegotiations amounted to some cosmetic changes only. Wilson s strategy paid off domestically, as the 1975 referendum result testifies. But the price was a fundamental deterioration of German trust in Britain s commitment to Europe. Margaret Thatcher s resolute attempts to reduce Britain s disproportionately high contributions to the EC budget reveals similar dynamics. For Thatcher, the budget issue was a major obstacle that had to be solved first, if Britain was to play a full and active role inside the EC, whereas Schmidt regarded her single-minded pursuit of the budget question as a fundamental challenge to the EC s principles and foundations. This is why Thatcher s attempts to get Schmidt on her side backfired so dramatically, even though Germany would also probably have gained from any major reform of the EC s financing structures. Schmidt, however, saw Germany s high budget contributions as a short-term economic price for a long-term strategic gain: the EC s political cohesion and stability. It was a logic that worked well from a German perspective; it failed to convince many British observers. Thatcher moves closer The irony is that Thatcher s first years in office saw Britain move closer to Europe than ever before. At the same time that the prime minister was demanding  her money back  in Brussels, she also worked tirelessly behind the scenes to foster joint European positions within the transatlantic alliance against the background of the so-called  second  Cold War. In the major transatlantic crises over NATO s dual-track decision, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Siberian gas pipeline project, Thatcher frequently defended European viewpoints in Washington   much to the dismay of her American counterpart Ronald Reagan. But it was the Iron Lady who usually caught the headlines in Germany and who stands tall as the supreme embodiment of British Euroscepticism, even today. The frequent fights between Schmidt and his British rivals did not therefore signify a more general British aversion to all things European, as Schmidt would suggest so frequently in later years. Indeed, Britain had played a vital and proactive role in the reconstruction of Europe ever since the late 1940s, as its role in the establishment of the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) and NATO testifies. The reason why intra-EC tensions have nonetheless come to dominate perceptions of the British-German relationship after 1945 can again be found in the particular historical context of postwar Europe. For most Germans of Schmidt s generation, the European project exerted a strong emotional pull that stretched far beyond the concrete advantages of a customs union: it offered a unique opportunity to rehabilitate and reinvent postwar Germany within a European framework and to distance itself from the horrors of the recent past. Wilson and Thatcher, by contrast, may have concluded rationally that EC membership was in Britain s national interest, but they lacked any comparative emotive and personal attachment to the European project. The EC therefore remained only one of many possible arenas for European cooperation in 1970s Britain   and not one that suited the country particularly well. For most Germans, however, the EC had by that time become the only framework for European cooperation. Any criticisms of its institutions and policies were almost inevitably interpreted as more general attacks on the very principles of European cooperation and solidarity. This is the big European misunderstanding that lies at the heart of British-German relations under Schmidt. Today s European Union bears rather little resemblance to the EC of the 1970s. Nonetheless, some of the key dynamics tearing Britain and Germany apart in the 1970s can still be witnessed in contemporary debates over  Brexit : Britain is still ill at ease with many of the EU s most basic institutional characteristics and principles, whereas Germany seems anxious to preserve the EU s substance and cohesion, even at significant cost. It is thus tempting to read Schmidt s journey as merely one episode of a much longer history where the European integration process has acquired an importance for Germany which   for various reasons   has never been replicated in Britain. Yet Schmidt s story also shows that these different British and German perspectives were the result of the specific historical context of the immediate postwar decades and that they centred primarily on the concrete mechanisms and dynamics of the European Community in the 1970s. They should not be treated as evidence of an allegedly eternal British Euroscepticism, deeply rooted in British culture and history, contrary to Schmidt s musings in later years.

        "content": "What hath God wrought?  Perhaps it is a coincidence, but in the spring of 1848   four years after Samuel Morse tapped out those first words in code and sent them out into the silence   the dead started tapping out messages to the living too. It happened in upstate New York where the Fox family had recently moved. Their farmhouse was said to be haunted; a spirit was heard knocking in the night. The two youngest daughters, Catherine and Margaretta, both adolescents, discovered that if they asked questions the spirit would knock in reply. It revealed itself to belong to a 31-year-old man. Neighbours came to listen. Someone had the idea of reciting the alphabet to help the spirit speak.  One Tuesday night, at twelve o clock , the girls  mother recalled him revealing, he  was murdered by having its throat cut with a butcher knife . Spiritualism, and with it the ritual of the s ance, was born. It was a  spiritual telegraph , a friend said. The fame of the Fox sisters spread. People came to speak to the spirits of children they had lost, others came for advice on love or on stocks and shares. It seems to have been the girls  older sister Leah Fish   35 and married   who saw the commercial possibilities. On 14 November 1848 the first public demonstration of the sisters  powers took place at the Corinthian Hall in Rochester.  We ... could not but admit the evidence of [our] senses , the local paper reported.  THE GHOST was there.  Spiritualism exploded. By the late 1860s there were some 11 million spiritualists in the US alone. Fame took its toll on the Fox sisters, however. In 1888 Margaretta, widowed and alcoholic, gave an interview to the New York Herald.  Is it all a trick?  the journalist asked.  Absolutely , Margaretta replied.  Spirits, is he not easily fooled?  As a child, she explained, she learned to make the sounds using the joints in her feet. A sense of sadness pervades the interview.  The spirits will not come back , she said of the dead.

        "title": "The Heretic of Cacheu  and  Worlds of Unfreedom  review",
        "content": "The Portuguese pioneered trans-Atlantic slavery, trafficking more people than any other nation and continuing to do so decades after Britain s abolition of the trade in 1807. Yet the country s first, long-promised, memorial to victims of slavery   Angolan artist Kiluanji Kia Henda s  Plantation   Prosperity and Nightmare    only materialised in Lisbon in 2021. As is the case in other countries with a shameful history of involvement with the slave trade, discussions of that history can be contentious.  Those who question the narrative are called  woke  and face arguments such as  it was the British Empire that was racist, not ours , explained historian Pedro Cardim in 2023. The question  what about Portugal?  has likewise been posed by those seeking to decentre Britain s own history of participation in the slave trade. These two books from historians immersed in the lusophone colonial world bookend the beginning and end of Portuguese involvements in the Atlantic slave trade. In The Heretic of Cacheu Toby Green explores the minutiae of everyday interactions among Portuguese slave traders, mixed-heritage middle-women, and African chiefdoms in a town where trans-Atlantic slave-trading was taking off in the early 17th century. In Worlds of Unfreedom, Roquinaldo Ferreira develops a similarly fine-grained account of Portuguese traffickers  relationships with Africans at a time when abolitionism was threatening the economic dominance of all those complicit in that trade. Green s story is centred on the arrest and Inquisitorial trial for heresy of Crispina Peres, a woman of Portuguese and Bainuk descent, who was married to the former captain-general of Cacheu in today s Guinea-Bissau, in the mid-1600s. Like most of the town s elite, Peres both owned domestic slaves and traded captives to the Portuguese  market . The latter were obtained primarily by armed groups known as gampisas in the interior, and by Bijag  islanders who lived on the offshore archipelago and raided mainland communities. Local and more distant African polities   the Bainuk, Pepel, Flouk, Mandinga, Jolof, and Ser er   variously avoided, resisted, or profited from the Atlantic trade networks. One of Green s key insights is how tenuous the boundary was between the different forms of slavery in Cacheu. Societies in West Africa had long practised a domestic form of enslavement for war captives and those born into slavery. These captives survived within the owner s household in relationships of dependency, subject always to their caprice. But the slavery introduced by the Portuguese was different. It entailed the reduction of captives to the status of commodity for export. Green writes that Peres had  a clear understanding of the hatred that underlay her daily interactions  with the enslaved in her household, but exploited their  terrible fear of being sold into Atlantic trafficking . Household slavery in Cacheu was at least preferable to the Middle Passage. The town s social hierarchy rested on free people s attempts to mark their free status and enslaved peoples  efforts to demonstrate their value to local owners and avoid being sold to the traffickers. Green describes life in Cacheu in far more detail than historians of local colonial societies usually manage thanks largely to the Inquisition records of witnesses  interrogation for Peres  trial in Lisbon in 1665. They included some of Peres  own household slaves. One of them, Sabasti o Rodrigues Barraza, claimed that he had denounced Peres because he had been promised his freedom by her accusers. These included two of Peres  major commercial rivals and the main instigator, the disgraced priest Luis Rodrigues, who had himself been arrested by the Inquisition for soliciting women in the confession booth. Together these men conspired to denounce Peres for the  use of African healing and knowledge  which, they knew, would be interpreted in Lisbon as an assault on empire. Her real crime, Green argues, was her challenge to these Portuguese men s dominance of the local slave trading economy. Having spent three years in the Inquisitorial jail, Peres died soon after her return to Cacheu in 1668. Ferreira s account takes place two centuries later and more than 2,000 miles south in Angola, the main source of captives for the by-then illicit slave trade. As the Portuguese historian Jo o Pedro Marques has suggested, the imperial authorities adopted a gradualist approach after British abolition in 1807, partly as a  cautious guarantee  to Portugal s domestic antislavery campaigners, and partly to assuage pressure from abroad. The loss of Brazil as the main source of demand for Portuguese trafficking after 1822 meant that the empire had less to lose from enforcing abolition and more to gain by taking some of the initiative back from Britain. Enforcing abolition of the Atlantic trade also enabled Portugal to retain captive labour within its African colonies. Like the British and French, the Portuguese were intent by the mid-19th century on extracting Africa s raw materials. They learned from the British how to use antislavery initiatives to pursue this new post-slavery project, invading the Kongo kingdom and taking control of the Bembe copper mines in 1856 on the pretext of suppressing slavery before the British could do so. Their  antislavery  military expedition conveniently carried mining equipment. Abolition thus became  a tool for the creation of new forms of unfreedom . As one French official explained, referring to the British practice of forcing Africans  liberated  from slave ships to work elsewhere in its empire,  England herself gives us an example , the only difference being that the  French bought their captives on land and the English seized theirs at sea and forced them to emigrate . The Portuguese justified the removal of African men and women from Angola to work on the coffee plantations of S o Tom  and Pr ncipe by invoking the British example of forcing  apprentices  from Sierra Leone to work on Caribbean sugar plantations. Both authors take great care to emphasise the agency of African people. Ferreira tells the intriguing story of Eufrazina, an enslaved African woman whom the Luanda businesswoman and slave trader Dona Ana Joaquina sent as envoy to negotiate a treaty with the powerful Lunda Kingdom. Anticipating the supply of captives for the Atlantic trade drying up, Joaquina hoped to initiate and monopolise a new trade in wax, ivory, and captives purely for the local market. British officials praised her for leading  the only attempt to give capital a more wholesome direction  by developing sugar production using locally enslaved African labour. But both books are obliged, ultimately, to recognise the limited ability of their African protagonists to challenge a highly militarised and increasingly rich and powerful Europe. At both the beginning and the end of slavery, West Africa s economies were reoriented around European demands, first for the extraction of captives, and then for the exploitation of land and labour in situ. In the meantime, between the 1650s and the 1850s, mixed-race elites had more power in the Portuguese slave-trading entrep ts than one might expect. In 1836, Benguela s Portuguese governor lamented that:  Every time that elections have taken place ... those elected have always been either blacks or mixed-race individuals [pardos], and whites have been excluded.  The resistance that Portugal encountered from these groups as it abolished its slave trade and developed as a territorial colonial power is a key part of the region s history, as Ferreira s book shows. Together these painstakingly researched studies recreate a world in which slavery was a significant but widely disavowed part of everyday life.

This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of a writer who sought to interpret for her own time a form of spirituality which can be especially difficult for a modern Western audience to grasp.

        "title": "El General simo  by Giles Tremlett book review",
        "content": "The bloody victor of the Spanish Civil War continues to evoke controversy. When, in 2011, Spain s Royal Academy of History, under the supervision of a former Franco loyalist, published a dictionary describing Franco as  authoritarian, but not a dictator , the backlash raged for years. The past quarter-century of Spanish public life has been shaped by so-called  memory wars  in which both the intransigent left and right have politicised attempts to identify the mass graves of republican dead and unveil the convenient silence ( pact of oblivion ) which overlay the latter two-thirds of Spain s 20th century. Franco s regime has been presented as authoritarian (Juan Linz), genocidal (Helen Graham), and fascistic in inception (Paul Preston). The regime s apologists presented the personal rule of Western Europe s last dictator as developmentalist, providential, even as an  organic democracy . In this biography, Giles Tremlett describes Franco as  a giant dam, determined to control the flow of Spanish history . However, 50 years after his death in November 1975,  what surprises is not the size of the dam that was opened after he died, but the ideological emptiness that lay behind it . Mediocre, incurious, and obsequious towards his Axis patrons, Franco had none of the charisma of Mussolini or Mao, nor any of the avuncular qualities of the sister regime of Salazar in Portugal. It is faint praise to rate him less fanatically murderous than Adolf Hitler, or less tyrannically ruthless than Joseph Stalin (even though Franco possessed as much internal power as Europe s bloodiest totalitarians). Tremlett s Franco is a cautious, ambitious, and unthinkingly authoritarian man, youthfully brave in Spanish Morocco, callously attritional in middle age leading the rebels to victory in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), and vindictive and shifty in the grey areas of politics thereafter. Unrivalled at dividing and ruling allies and enemies alike, he was also prone to delusions which only his peculiar luck prevented from unravelling his regime at home and abroad. Tremlett explains Franco s formative years without imposing 21st-century psychology on the patriarchal norms and family hypocrisies of 1890s Spain. He was born to a doting mother and a wayward (later estranged) father in Ferrol, a Galician port city where the navy was everything in a Spain where it was nothing. Franco s childhood was forged by the upheavals of the turn of the century. The loss of Spain s major colonies in the war of 1898 fired up a generation of army officers determined to restore national honour in new campaigns to extend Spanish control over the northern part of Morocco. Like so many of his generation, Franco believed in ill-focused national  regeneration    and in the responsibility of the army to achieve it. As a young officer Franco excelled. Despite his social awkwardness, he married into a higher social rank in 1917. His subordinates and officer comrades respected his battlefield bravery and at 31 Franco became Europe s youngest general since Napoleon. The Second Republic (1931-36) alienated his naturally conservative and Catholic instincts. But unlike other leading army plotters (Sanjurjo, Mola, Queipo de Llano, et al.) Franco was politically malleable. He was neither too monarchical, nor too Carlist, nor too fascist, nor too republican: these factors as much as his command of elite troops in Spanish Morocco made him General simo ten weeks into the Civil War. In addition to his clever operations marching on Madrid in October 1936 and his direct diplomacy with Hitler, Franco was a soldier s soldier who divided right-wingers the least. But neither his allies nor his enemies imagined that the five-feet-four-inch Galician would remain in power for half a century. After the victory of 1939 Tremlett takes us into the well-trodden ground of postwar Spain. Believing until incredibly late in the Second World War that an Axis victory was likely, Franco was too slow in reverting from non-belligerent to neutral status. He aggravated his regime s postwar isolation by imposing self-defeating economic autarky and indulging the corruption of his subordinates. Another 50-or-so pages on the post-1939 era would have improved Tremlett s analysis. More could have been made of the ravages of the developmentalist frenzy of the 1940s and 1950s, including hydrology, irrigation, and resettlement schemes. The diplomatic context is largely Eurocentric: not much is made of Franco s unusually good relations with the Arab world, or the integrist links with Latin America. The economic impact of world trade and tourism is better handled. Once liberalisation finally improved the economy after 1959 Franco s regime took the credit, in a similar way to the post-Cold War Chinese Communist Party after the horrors of Maoism. Youth revolt, European cultural norms, and the defection of the Catholic Church all frayed the dictatorship in its final years. But the failure of internal and external opposition to unite, combined with the dreary apoliticism which the regime had drummed into the masses, meant that Franco died a natural death in November 1975   a remarkable achievement for one of Europe s nastiest dictators. Given Franco s remarkable agency throughout his reign, one is given to ponder the  what ifs  implicit in Tremlett s account. What if Franco s stomach wound in 1916 had proved fatal? What if his feet had stayed cold in the army plot of 1936? What if he had joined the Axis in 1940 and suffered Allied invasion as a consequence? Or, even more radically, what if he had dared to break with the Axis in the final weeks of the 1945 campaign in Western Europe and declared war on the Nazis, thereby accruing to his regime something of the cheap economic and geostrategic benefits that the left-authoritarian C rdenas regime of Mexico enjoyed in its symbolic war with Japan? In a biography as agentic as Tremlett s, one is given to wonder about Spanish history s many glaring counterfactuals.

        "title": "Chernobyl Children  by Melanie Arndt review",
        "content": "The explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on 26 April 1986 was an environmental catastrophe. The radioactive fallout contaminated territory that was home to seven million people, including three million children. It also reached Western Europe, causing an international scandal. And still, the Soviet authorities attempted to do what they always did when it came to major accidents: hush it up. For three years the state concealed the truth about the scale of the disaster from its citizens and the world. All this changed because of the children, as Melanie Arndt reveals in her book. Why, many asked, if the radiation levels supposedly posed no danger, were some children from contaminated areas being evacuated to other parts of the country? In the charged political atmosphere of the late 1980s, when glasnost turned from a slogan into actual policy, the authorities yielded to mounting public pressure. In February 1989 two main Belarusian newspapers were the first to print maps showing the extent of the radioactive contamination. Pravda followed suit six weeks later (an unprecedented reversal of the Soviet press hierarchy). The censorship ban on Chernobyl collapsed two months after that. The revelations made clear that the children living in contaminated areas needed urgent help. Initially, all eyes turned to the state, which had long boasted that it provided Soviet children with the happiest childhood in the world. As it turned out, the state could do precious little. With the economy in free fall, it had few resources available to offer the medical care required. Local authorities in Belarus and Ukraine increasingly felt abandoned by Moscow. The regime s failure to protect the children contributed to its spiralling loss of legitimacy. Caught between public anger and its own impotence, the Soviet government openly appealed for international help. In March 1990 Cuba received its first group of 139 children. Only recently itself the recipient of Soviet aid, Cuba covered all the expenses and Fidel Castro personally welcomed the children at the airport. Cuba would go on to host more than 20,000 children over the following two decades. Charity had been a dirty word in Soviet ideology, but the environmental crisis coupled with economic collapse forced a rethink. Numerous initiatives sprang up to fill the vacuum left by the dying regime, paving the way from socialist to civil society. Before that first group arrived in Cuba, a non-state initiative in Belarus had organised the first recuperative trip abroad, sending a group of children from the Belarusian village of Stralichava to India in December 1989. Many more trips to Europe, Canada, and the US would follow. Through her detailed account of this organisation, registered in November 1990 as the Belarusian Charitable Foundation for the Children of Chernobyl, Arndt traces how civil society helped turn  the Soviet Chernobyl children  into the  children of the whole world . The Belarusian Charitable Foundation was just one of several organisations that collectively sent more than one million Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Russian children abroad. While historians have shown how Chernobyl animated anti-Soviet opposition in Ukraine, Arndt s book reminds us how central the trauma has been in Belarus. Around 70 per cent of the radioactive contamination landed there, not least because the authorities in Moscow ordered that the  dirty  clouds be made to rain over Belarus in order to protect Russian and Ukrainian cities. As Arndt argues, civil society cannot exist outside of politics. Suspicious of state authority, the foundation believed that their project would have more than just health benefits for the children it sent abroad. It would help democratise Belarus, where authoritarianism returned after the election of Aliaksandr Lukashenka in 1994. His regime harassed the foundation precisely because it saw its activities in the same political light. In 1997 the KGB investigated it for four months on charges of financial irregularities and funding the opposition. After nearly 25 difficult years, the foundation ended its work in 2014. But politics also shaped the Western response, on which all efforts to help Belarusian children hinged. Civil societies across the Atlantic (Arndt s main focus) were galvanised into action, but their motivations were a tangled knot of personal agendas and politics. These were exciting times, as ordinary Americans suddenly gained an opportunity to pursue citizens  diplomacy with the former  evil empire . Despite the book s title, this is mostly a story about adults: state organisations failing to fulfil their obligations, civil society rising on the ruins of socialism, transnational humanitarian networks forming in the wake of the Cold War. Only in the final chapter do the children take centre stage, alongside their Belarusian chaperones and American hosts. It seems a pity that this essential part of the story is relegated to the finale. It is clear from the interviews and the study by two Belarusian social psychologists on which Arndt relies that the experience burst open the children s horizons. One participant remembers West Germany as  an explosion, a shock, nothing but positive emotions . Perhaps Lukashenka was right to worry. After all, the generation of former Chernobyl children challenged his regime in unprecedented mass protests that swept Belarus in 2020. The regime s botched handling of another health-related disaster, the Covid-19 pandemic, combined with anger over fraudulent elections to produce a perfect storm. But unlike Gorbachev in 1991, Lukashenka survived by resorting to brutal repression, which continues to this day. Another generation of Belarusian children now lives in the shadow of Chernobyl, but there are no transnational humanitarian networks left to offer them respite. State repression has wiped out Belarusian civil society and depleted the medical profession. The regime s collusion in Russia s war on Ukraine has sealed Belarus  isolation from the West.

        "content": "After two decades and an estimated cost of $1bn, the Grand Egyptian Museum opens its doors to the public on Tuesday. After two decades and an estimated cost of $1bn, the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) opened its doors to the public on Tuesday, just a few days after the official opening ceremony on Saturday. Regarded as the world s largest archaeological facility for a single civilisation, the museum is located 2km (1.2 miles) from the pyramids of Giza and 8km (5 miles) from the capital, Cairo. The complex spans nearly 500,000sq metres (5,381,900sq ft) and will house more than 100,000 ancient artefacts from the 30 dynasties of ancient Egypt. Some of the main attractions include the 3,200-year-old, 11.36-metre (37ft) statue of King Ramses II, the complete collection of Tutankhamun s treasures and a 4,500-year-old boat, one of the oldest intact ships in the world, belonging to Khufu, the pharaoh renowned for building the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Grand Egyptian Museum s design The museum has been called the  fourth pyramid  of the Giza Plateau, which is home to three pyramids about 4,500 years old: the Great Pyramid of Giza (built for Pharaoh Khufu), the Pyramid of Khafre (built for Pharaoh Khafre) and the Pyramid of Menkaure (built for Pharaoh Menkaure). Visitors can view the pyramids from inside the museum, which is designed in the shape of a chamfered triangle, echoing the geometry of the pyramids. The museum s north and south walls are aligned with the Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure. The design, created by the Irish architecture firm Heneghan Peng, uses sand-coloured concrete and translucent alabaster stone while the museum s main facade is made of frosted glass panels. The complex was announced in 1992, but construction did not begin until 2005 and was delayed by political turmoil after the 2011 Arab Spring and the COVID-19 pandemic. Some areas of the museum had a soft launch in 2024. The museum complex includes the main building, a conference centre, a courtyard, a Nile Valley park, the Khufu Boat Museum and a conservation centre. A look inside the museum Upon entering the museum, visitors are greeted by the 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II, which weighs about 83 tonnes. Advertisement From 1954 to 2006, the statue stood in Ramses Square in front of Cairo s main train station before being relocated to its new location near the museum. To facilitate the move, the statue was transported upright and in one piece on a specially designed 128-wheel vehicle, covering a distance of 30km (19 miles) and necessitating temporary road closures. Beyond the entrance is the six-storey grand staircase, lined with about 60 artefacts, including statues that honour deities, sarcophagi that hold the deceased, columns showcasing ancient architectural artistry,, and stelae inscribed with significant texts. The museum boasts 12 main permanent exhibition halls, which opened last year and are organised by both era (ranging from prehistory through the Greco-Roman period) and theme (including society, kingship and belief). The Tutankhamun gallery Among the museum s most prominent and largest exhibition spaces is the Tutankhamun Gallery, a 7,500sq-metre (80,000sq-ft) space that features more than 5,000 artefacts unearthed from the tomb of Tutankhamun, the boy king who ascended to the throne at about nine years old and ruled during the Eighteenth Dynasty nearly 3,400 years ago. Despite his brief reign, which ended with his unexpected death at about 18 or 19 years old, Tutankhamun is one of the most famous pharaohs, largely due to the discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922 in the Valley of the Kings on the west side of the Nile opposite the city of Luxor. Visitors can see his golden mask, throne, sarcophagus, chariots and jewellery, all presented to re-create the atmosphere of his royal burial chamber. One of the world s largest museums The Grand Egyptian Museum has about 45,000sq metres (484,000sq ft) of exhibition space, making it the sixth largest museum in the world by display area. The Louvre in Paris tops the list with 72,735sq metres, followed by the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia (66,842sq metres), the National Museum of China in Beijing (65,000sq metres), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City (58,820sq metres) and the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain (47,700sq metres). Tourism is a major source of foreign currency for Egypt. In 2024, a record 15.7 million tourists visited Egypt, and the travel and tourism sector contributed roughly 8 percent of the country s gross domestic product, according to official figures.",

        "title": "Mona Lisa to the Nazis: Robbed often, why latest Louvre theft is different",
        "content": "Experts say jewels stolen in heists from the iconic Parisian museum are harder to recover than stolen paintings, as they can be quickly broken down. The band of robbers who broke into the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning and stole eight Napoleonic pieces of priceless jewellery in a four-minute heist were just the latest in a long line of daring thieves who have targeted the iconic museum. The robbers used a truck-mounted ladder to reach the gilded Galerie d Apollon (Apollo s Gallery) on the second floor before taking an angle grinder to a window to access the French crown jewels. The heist took place at 9:30am (07:30 GMT), half an hour after the museum opened to visitors for the day. The robbers are still at large and the Louvre is currently closed. A ninth item they stole   the crown belonging to Empress Eugenie, Napoleon III s wife   was recovered nearby after it was dropped by the group, the French Ministry of the Interior said. The Louvre was a royal palace for more than two centuries. It opened as a public museum in 1793 during the French Revolution. The revolution had made totems of monarchical history especially vulnerable to looters, and the Louvre, besides giving everyday French people a glimpse of these precious items, sought to protect the legacy they represented, for future generations. That did not completely stop thieves, however. Over time, there have been several attempts to steal valuable items from the Louvre   often successful. 1911: The Mona Lisa is stolen On August 21, 1911, Leonardo da Vinci s Mona Lisa was stolen in what was deemed the  heist of the century . At the time, the Mona Lisa was one of Italian painter da Vinci s lesser-known works and had been on display since 1797. Many now say it was the theft itself that propelled the painting to its modern fame. At the time, the painting was hanging on a wall in a room called the  Salon Carre . Advertisement The heist was carried out by Vincenzo Peruggia, a 29-year-old Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre. He entered the museum completely unchallenged on the evening of August 20, clad in his old museum uniform. Peruggia hid in a storage closet overnight and, in the morning, when the museum was closed and almost empty, emerged from the closet. He simply removed the painting from the wall and wrapped it in a white sheet. As he made to leave the museum, he found the stairwell door to the courtyard locked. But instead of being suspicious, a Louvre plumber helped Peruggia to unlock the door, mistaking him for a colleague. Museum security was rather less robust back then, and paintings would often be removed for maintenance or to be photographed. Hence, no one batted an eye at the absence of the da Vinci painting for more than a day. Concern over its absence was eventually raised by a visiting artist, who came to the Salon Carre to paint. When the Louvre guards could not find the painting, police were alerted. What followed was an extensive manhunt and media frenzy. The police did not initially find many leads. Avant garde poet Guillaume Apollinaire was arrested and questioned due to his links to earlier thefts from the Louvre. Apollinaire, who was cleared of suspicion, pointed to his friend, a young Pablo Picasso, who was also questioned by the police. Picasso was cleared of suspicion in the theft of the Mona Lisa, but in a grand twist, it was revealed he had previously acquired Iberian statue heads which had been stolen from the Louvre. He returned these to the Louvre to avoid any further trouble. Rumours and speculation mounted about the painting s possible whereabouts, with many believing it was smuggled abroad. But, the whole time, the Mona Lisa was actually in Peruggia s one-bedroom apartment in Paris. It was finally recovered in 1913 when Peruggia attempted to sell it to a gallery in Italy. He believed the sale had been successful when an art dealer he was in touch with invited him to Italy for a potential sale to a gallery, and he took the painting with him. Instead of buying the painting, however, the gallery turned Peruggia in. He was arrested in his hotel room in Florence. The Mona Lisa was returned to the Louvre in 1914, and Peruggia was charged with the theft. He said he had been motivated by national pride to steal the painting, claiming the painting had been looted from Italy. The painting was actually completed in France by Da Vinci and sold to the French royal family. 1940s: The Nazis attempt to loot the Louvre In 1940, the Nazis invaded France amid World War II and appeared poised to loot a section of the Louvre. Advertisement However, as a preemptive move, Jacques Jaujard, the director of France s national museums, ordered more than 1,800 cases containing Louvre masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa, to be moved to the French countryside. This prevented a large-scale cultural loss when the Nazis marched into a largely empty museum. However, the Nazis did steal many pieces of Jewish artwork while occupying France. Many of these have been returned to France, and the Louvre began displaying them in 2018 in an attempt to reunite the stolen pieces with their original owners. 1960s to 1990s: More robberies In 1966, five pieces of antique, handmade jewellery were stolen from John F Kennedy International Airport in New York. The jewellery was en route back to Paris from the United States, having been loaned by the Louvre for a museum display in Richmond, Virginia. Detectives later recovered the jewellery in a grocery bag, and three men were arrested for receiving stolen property. In 1990, Pierre Auguste Renoir s Portrait of a Seated Woman was cut from its frame and stolen from the third floor of the Louvre. At the same time, the museum discovered that some small jewellery items were also missing   and may have been for some time.  The disappearance of these objects, which are not of great value and are often seen on the market, is certainly quite old,  the then-director of museums in France said, according to The New York Times. It is unclear whether these items were ever recovered. What s different this time? This week s jewellery heist is distinctive because previous high-profile robberies in the Louvre have largely been of paintings.  A jewellery theft is a very different thing to consider because of the high intrinsic value of the object stolen,  American art historian Noah Charney told Al Jazeera. Paintings have a non-intrinsic value, which is value assigned to them due to their cultural significance, he explained.  A painting doesn t have a high intrinsic value because it s usually made of panel and pigment, and canvas and nothing more. Whereas jewellery has a high intrinsic value because if you break down what was stolen and sell the components, the value is still significant.  With jewels, the cultural heritage value, which provides the majority of its value, is not something that the thieves are likely to take into consideration,  Charney added. Does this make stolen jewels harder to trace? Yes. Collections of jewels can be broken down, recut and sold in a way that does not link them to the intact stolen items, making them almost impossible to trace   yet very valuable. They do not even need to be on the black market if the jewels are recut significantly enough that they are not identifiable.  The only hope that police have, and we understand this from how past cases have played out, is if they offer a reward for the recovery of all the jewels intact that is higher than the value of the component parts of the jewellery,  Charney said. Such a move might buy the police a bit more time to track down the items and catch those responsible as the thieves ponder their next move. Advertisement  Otherwise, I m afraid there s not much hope that these will be recovered and they would likely have been cut down within hours of the theft,  he said.",

        "content": "Beneath William & Mary s Robert M. Gates Hall, archaeologists this summer uncovered a remarkable find: the near-complete 18th-century foundation of the Williamsburg Bray School. The Bray School, one of the oldest known institutions in North America dedicated to the education of enslaved and free Black children, operated on the site from 1760 to 1765. Its foundations were thought to be only partially intact. Researchers also discovered a previously undocumented cellar, layered with centuries of artifacts. The discoveries provide a new portal into the site s past, providing a more complete story of the Williamsburg Bray School, its scholars and their impact. Archaeologists from the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research work at the dig site beneath Gates Hall. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research)  As the United States prepares to mark its 250th anniversary, William & Mary is embracing its role as a steward of the nation s origin stories   and as a catalyst for their expansion,  said W&M President Katherine A. Rowe.  The discovery of this cellar is thrilling,  Rowe added.  The roots of our city and university entwine here. Every layer of history that it reveals gives us new insights into our early republic, from the Williamsburg Bray School through the generations that followed, up through the early 20th century.  Layered with history The foundation and cellar discoveries were first made early this spring by Colonial Williamsburg Foundation (CWF) archaeologists conducting preliminary investigations for the Gates Hall renovation project. The W&M Real Estate Foundation is managing the renovation and expansion on behalf of the W&M Foundation. Since the spring, the W&M Center for Archaeological Research (the Center), under the leadership of Elizabeth J. Monroe and David Lewes, has expanded the excavation and led artifact recovery. The cellar is sizeable: approximately 36 by 18 feet. Two distinct levels are emerging. The Center team has exposed the bottom of the cellar almost eighteen inches higher than the previous depth found by the CWF team.  It looks like the cellar was a partial cellar, and had different floor levels potentially,  said Center Project Archaeologist Tom Higgins.  It s not a brick-lined cellar   it was probably dug soon after the foundations were laid.  In addition to the foundation and cellar, their work is revealing a rich archaeological story that stretches from the 18th century to the mid-20th century: jewelry, slate pencil fragments, sherds of pottery and vases, buttons   the stuff of everyday life, the ephemera of history. 19th and 20th century artifacts recovered from the cellar layers found beneath Gates Hall. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research) Each excavated layer reveals more discoveries. Among the recovered items are fragments of colonoware pottery   handmade ceramics often associated with sites of enslavement and Indigenous communities   as well as sherds of Greek Revival ceramics, glass, and decorative items linked to the women who lived in Brown Hall during the early 1900s. Before it was moved down Prince George Street in 1930, the original Williamsburg Bray School building housed Methodist women attending William & Mary from 1924-1930. These students were among the first generations of women to attend college in the U.S. The significance of these discoveries is amplified by the site s connection to the Williamsburg Bray School. Archaeologists found this sherd of glass containing a depiction of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, war and the arts. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research) A favorite recovery of the team is a sherd of glass depicting Minerva, Roman goddess of wisdom, justice, war and the arts. The Minerva sherd juxtaposes with a piece of late 19th century or early 20th century flatware, painted with a Greek meandros pattern.  We know that the girls at Brown Hall were furnishing their dorms,  Michele L. Brumfield, senior researcher at the Center, said.  So maybe they were bringing in things like this.  The team is careful not to draw too many conclusions from what they are finding   yet.  It s early days,  Monroe added. Once bagged and labeled, artifacts will travel to the lab at the Center for further study. Spaces of engagement Plans are underway to incorporate the archaeological discoveries, as well as photographs and other documents, into a permanent exhibit inside Gates Hall. The exhibit will be co-curated with members of the Williamsburg Bray School Descendant Community and other stakeholders. Their stories   once lost to the recesses of the cellar   will enlighten students and visitors. Other artifacts will be lent to The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, where they will join additional items connected to the site for display at the Colin G. and Nancy N. Campbell Archaeology Center, scheduled to open in 2026. One of the recovered artifacts appears to be a pin with tiny inlaid shells dating to the early 20th-century. (Image courtesy of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research) At Gates Hall, the intention is to outline the foundation of the original Bray School on the floor and, if possible, excavate a portion for display in the exhibit   reminders of the lives lived on the site. The renovation at Gates Hall, made possible by a $30 million gift from an anonymous alumna, represents William & Mary s commitment to addressing 21st-century challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration. The building will house the Global Research Institute, the Institute for Integrative Conservation and the Whole of Government Center of Excellence. Ann Marie Stock, presidential liaison for Strategic Cultural Partnerships, leads these collaborative efforts. She envisions a portal which will shed light on those who traversed the site over centuries:  foragers and farmers, singers and soldiers, clerks and clergy, dancers, drummers, weavers, writers, teachers, learners, and so many others, all belonged to this community through the years.

        "title": "Ancient Artifacts Unearthed in Iraq Shed Light on Hidden History of Mesopotamia",
        "content": "New discoveries by a UCF researcher and her team at the ancient Mesopotamian site of Kurd Qaburstan, including clay tablets with ancient cuneiform writing, a game board and large structural remains, may provide a wealth of knowledge about this Middle Bronze Age city and shed light on the more hidden history of Mesopotamia. The clay tablets are the first of their kind found in the region and are still being interpreted. Early findings indicate they provide a greater insight about the people who lived there and the significantly consequential events they encountered. One of three clay cuneiform tablets discovered at the Middle Bronze Age site of Kurd Qaburstan in northeast Iraq. It was found in a debris-filled corridor in the lower town palace. Early interpretations of this tablet suggests dramatic events and possibly ancient warfare. (Photo courtesy of Tiffany Earley-Spadoni) Tiffany Earley-Spadoni, an associate professor of history at UCF, and a team of researchers have been carefully uncovering culturally significant Middle Bronze Age (1800 BCE) discoveries at Mesopotamian site of Kurd Qaburstan, which is situated in the Erbil region in northeast Iraq. A significant portion of human development and history may be traced back to the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia, in and around present-day Iraq. The study of these new tablets could reveal important details about the city s connections with its neighbors during the Middle Bronze Age and its historical significance. For example, by studying people s names, word choice and writing styles, scholars may better understand literacy in the region and the city s cultural identity, Earley-Spadoni says in her fieldwork summary. Hidden History The Middle Bronze Age in northern Iraq is poorly understood due to limited prior research and the inherent biases of the available historical sources, she says.  We hope to find even more historical records that will help us tell the story of [the city] from the perspective of its own people rather than relying only on accounts written by their enemies,  Earley-Spadoni says.  While we know a great deal about the development of writing in southern Iraq, far less is known about literacy in northern Mesopotamian cities, especially near Erbil where Kurd Qaburstan is located.  Mesopotamia, with its dense network of ancient cities in the fertile plains along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers near the Persian Gulf, is often regarded as the birthplace of urban civilization. These cities, preserved as towering tells, mounds formed by centuries of accumulated cultural debris, have captivated scholars for generations.  We know quite a bit about Mesopotamian cities in the south, and that s considered the traditional heartland of cities,  Earley-Spadoni says.  When people think about where cities first arose, they imagine cities in southern Iraq, like Uruk. We seek to fill in this gap in the scholarship by investigating a large urban site, one of the few that s ever been investigated in northern Iraq.  New Areas Uncovered, New Questions Raised Earley-Spadoni and researchers have been working in two primary areas: the northwest residential neighborhoods and a newly discovered administrative complex identified as a lower town palace, which was theorized to exist based on findings made in 2022. Researchers used technologies such as magnetometry, which allows researchers to peer through the ground to see architectural plans, to help excavate the site. The research is valuable its own right and helps shed light on regional history and worldwide heritage, she says.  The focus of the research is the organization of ancient cities, and it s specifically the organization of Kurd Qaburstan,  Earley-Spadoni says.  You may have heard of King Hammurabi, who erected the famous law code. So, this is about that same time almost 4,000 years ago. We decided that this would be an interesting place to investigate what it was like to be an everyday person at a city during the Middle Bronze Age, which has been an understudied topic. People like to excavate palaces and temples, and very few residential areas have been excavated.  Excavations in the palace revealed monumental architecture, human remains and evidence of destruction, suggesting a significant historical event. The complex, identified through geophysical surveys, is being excavated to establish its characteristics and better understand its function.

(Photo courtesy of Tiffany Earley-Spadoni) In the northwest neighborhoods, exterior courtyards, clay drainpipes, and household refuse were uncovered. Excavated pottery included everyday items such as cups, plates, bowls and storage jars. Some of the pottery was surprisingly well-decorated and carefully made, hinting that private wealth may have been more common than expected, Earley-Spadoni says in her fieldwork summary report. Animal bones found with the pottery suggest that residents enjoyed a varied diet, including domesticated meat and wild game. This level of variety of diet is unexpected for non-elite populations in Mesopotamian cities, based on limited current evidence. These findings may challenge ideas about sharp divisions between elite and non-elite lifestyles in ancient cities. The material culture and dietary practices reflect a community where some people lived relatively well and suggests that further research and analysis is needed to answer lingering questions, Earley-Spadoni says.  We re studying this ancient city to learn very specific things about the ancient inhabitants,  she says.  First, to what degree did they plan their environment, or was it just the result of an organic process? We also want to know how social inequality worked in this ancient city. Were there very poor people and very rich people? Or was there possibly a middle class?  Broken pieces of storage jars marked with a special identifier symbol from the lower town palace. (Photo courtesy of Tiffany-Earley-Spadoni) Encouraging Findings and a Promising Future The city s historical importance could be even greater if it is identified as Qabra, a major regional center referenced in Old Babylonian monuments like the famed Stele of Dadusha, according to Earley-Spadoni. There are many clues that give credence to the theory that Kurd Qaburstan was the prominent city of Qabra that has been referenced in Old Babylonian steles   or ancient monumental slabs. One such clue is that there are ample signs pointing to Kurd Qaburstan serving as a major regional administrative hub, she says.  Kurd Qaburstan is believed to be ancient Qabra, an important regional center mentioned in the records of other city-states,  Earley-Spadoni says.  The presence of writing, monumental architecture, and other administrative artifacts in the lower town palace further supports this identification since the site must have been an important city of its time.  The tablets are still being interpreted but there are some early encouraging findings that help illuminate the greater identity of the people of Kurd Qaburstan and the era they inhabited, she says.  The first of the three tablets was discovered in a trash-filled deposit along with building rubble and human remains,  she says.  Its context suggests dramatic events, possibly evidence of ancient warfare. We hope our work in 2025 will tell us more about this story.  The research and excavation efforts are funded through the U.S. National Science Foundation and in partnership with the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The work occurred from May to July 2024, with previous work conducted from 2013 to 2023 by a team from Johns Hopkins University that included Earley-Spadoni. Tiffany Earley-Spadoni has extensively studied Mesopotamian history and her efforts to excavate the site at Kurd Qaburstan have continued since 2013.

        "title": "Are we at a turning point in world history? | David Motadel",
        "content": "In 1919, at the height of a global crisis that resulted from the turmoil of the Russian Revolution, the devastation of the first world war, and the collapse of Europe s great continental empires, the Irish writer William Butler Yeats penned his famed warning to humanity, mourning the end of the old world:  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.  His words were recently invoked by Joe Biden, addressing the United Nations general assembly. Today, just as then, he warned, the world is facing a critical historical juncture:  I truly believe we are at another inflection point in world history where the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come.  The then president took the opportunity to offer some historical reflections. He recalled the global upheaval of the early 1970s, when he was first elected senator, at the height of the cold war, with wars raging from the Middle East to Vietnam, and a crisis simmering at home:  Back then, we were living through an inflection point, a moment of tension and uncertainty.  Throughout the 20th century, humankind had resolved major watershed crises. Today, with escalating wars from eastern Europe to the Middle East and with deepening divisions in our societies, it was time again, he urged, for concerted action. It was not the first time that Biden had historicized our time as an  inflection point  in world history. It has, in fact, become one of his signature political concepts, invoked in various speeches.  I ve said many times, we are at an inflection point,  he declared in his last foreign policy speech last week.  The post cold-war era is over. A new era has begun.  Many agree. The talk of  inflection points  has been echoed across the global political arena, as world leaders, among them the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, have adopted it to warn about the current geopolitical moment. The world today   marked by the global surge of autocratic powers and anti-democratic forces, the territorial conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Taiwan, the climate crisis, and a new unpredictable industrial revolution fueled by artificial intelligence   appears to be at a historic watershed. It is a moment that historian Adam Tooze dubbed as a  polycrisis . The phenomenon is not new, of course. Throughout history, the world has been rocked by major crises   political turmoil, wars and the downfall of great powers   which appeared earth-shattering at the time. And, routinely, contemporaries have declared them historical  turning points . The most striking of such events in modern history is the French Revolution, which fundamentally challenged the world s old monarchical order.  In two minutes the work of centuries was overturned,  the French revolutionary and writer Louis-S bastien Mercer celebrated in 1789.  Palaces and houses destroyed, churches overturned, their vaults torn asunder.  Even the critics of the revolutionary upheaval did not try to deny its profound historical significance.  The French Revolution is the most astonishing thing that hitherto happened in the world,  the conservative commentator Edmund Burke acknowledged in 1790.  Everything seems out of nature in this strange chaos of levity and ferocity and all sorts of crimes jumbled together.  In his lectures on the philosophy of history, given at the University of Berlin between 1822 and 1831, only a few decades after the storming of the Bastille, GWF Hegel noted that the significance of the French Revolution, with its  external expansion , had been  world historical . The turmoil of the revolutionary era, contemporaries agreed, was a critical historical juncture. Disillusionment followed. The turbulence of 1848 in Europe (and beyond) was also widely considered an inflection point. Revolutionaries across the continent celebrated that it was ushering in a new era of national awakening. Similarly, the years of the first world war were seen by contemporaries as a turning point of humanity. Woodrow Wilson considered it as a struggle that would  make the world safe for democracy ; HG Wells called it  the war to end war . After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Lenin claimed that the time had come for revolutionaries across  all countries and nations throughout the world  to change the course of history. Major mistakes made at that moment, from the ill-fated Versailles treaty to the ill-conceived League of Nations, paved the way for the next catastrophe. The second world war was routinely understood by wartime leaders as an inflection point, the  finest hour , that would be decisive in the triumph of democracy over tyranny. The end of the war, with the creation of the UN, Bretton Woods, Nato, and the European Coal and Steel Community, was hailed as a new era in the west, paving the way to prosperity. Likewise, the fall of the Berlin Wall seemed to spell the  end of history . Francis Fukuyama pondered whether the fundamental transformations of the time, which had engulfed  many regions in the world , would affect  world history . The triumph of liberalism was soon challenged by a global Islamist resurgence, an autocratic China and a revanchist Russia. The attacks of September 11 were seen by many contemporaries as another turning point.  For America, 9/11 was more than a tragedy,  George Bush remarked.  It changed the way we look at the world.  More generally, turning points or inflection points are major events in history that profoundly reshape our lives. One central characteristic of them is their irreversibility, as, afterwards, it seems impossible to return to the status quo ante. Unsurprisingly, political leaders, past and present, have also routinely invoked them, with some urgency, as ways to mobilize support for their cause. This has also allowed them to give their own time (and themselves, as actors or witnesses) historical significance. The major transformations and changes ... in history are always processes which evolve over decades and then become visible through certain events, or turning points Overall, inflection points, past and present, need to be taken seriously. Major moments in history have had irreversible consequences. Yet, we should be cautious not to obsess too much about the events as such. In fact, the fixation on turning points risks overlooking their deeper causes. To understand them, we need to take a sober look at the underlying structural transformations that produce them. In the end,  turning points  are always, at best, merely optical markers on the surface, the  crests of foam that the tides of history carry on their strong backs , as the historian Fernand Braudel put it. The major transformations and changes, the tectonic shifts, in history are always processes which evolve over decades and then become visible through certain events, or turning points. Historians have long studied historical turning points. This has involved questions about the significance or insignificance of certain events. It has also, more importantly, involved criticism of the search for (and the very idea of) turning points, based on the old controversy over the importance of  events  (and sudden changes) versus  structures  (and slow changes over time) in history. Historians have traditionally tended to look at earth-shattering events   wars, crises, revolutions, diplomatic deals   and the deeds of powerful individuals. This research reached its peak in the  great man  history of the 19th-century historicism centered on the German historian Leopold von Ranke. The concentration on great  events  provoked some criticism at the time, voiced by a wide range of scholars, most notably the historian Karl Lamprecht, economist Gustav Schmoller and sociologist Max Weber, who pointed to the importance of deeper social, economic and political transformations in shaping history, and the pitfalls of the idea of turning points. One of the most prominent of the critics was Karl Marx, who in his 1852 essay The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte memorablly declared:  Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past.  The most crushing criticism of the focus on events as turning points in history, however, came from the scholars of the French Annales school, such as Marc Bloch, Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel, who were interested in the deeper material and mental structures below the surface of events. In his 1949 magnum opus The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, Braudel, who coined term  structural history , explored the history of the Mediterranean on three levels: first, the history of the natural environment   geographical and geological conditions   which barely change over time; second, the social, economic and political structures, which slowly evolve, shaped by the natural environment; and third and least importantly, the events caused by human action, shaped by the conditions created by the first two levels. While environmental transformations and changes in social, economic and political structures must be studied over long periods, across generations, centuries, even millennia   the longue dur e   events can be studied within frameworks of days, weeks or years   the courte dur e. Braudel expressed deep mistrust about any fixation on dramatic short-term events   turning points   in conventional history writing. At first sight, he agreed, the past looks like a series of individual events. Yet, great political events and military defeats are actually much less significant on closer look. Sudden historical breaks are almost impossible. A focus on the surface, he warned, obscures the political, economic, social structures that make them possible. Indeed, there are many examples of turning points that turned out to be less momentous when studied as mere expressions of structural transformations. The year 1789 is impossible to understand without taking into account the deeper intellectual transformations, most notably the shifting ideas about society and the state rooted in the Enlightenment, and the profound material changes which led to tensions between nobility, clergy and commoners. Similarly, the moment of 1914 cannot be understood without considering the structures of international affairs, including secret diplomacy, and the rise of nationalism in the long 19th century. The turning point of 1989, likewise, was caused by the deepening economic stagnation of the Soviet Union, generational changes in Eastern Bloc leadership, and global ideological shifts. To understand September 11, we need to be aware of the long history of nativism, Islamism and anti-westernism in the global south. And so on. In all these cases, we need to grasp the underlying conditions if we are to understand the turning points they produced. Histories of great power politics, most notably Paul Kennedy s masterly Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, have long alluded to the deeper natural, economic and military structures that have created war and peace. To be sure, the focus on structures did, in turn, provoke some criticism. Some historians have argued that an idea of history in which individuals are prisoners of structural laws does not leave much room for human agency. Also, we, as humans and readers, prefer narratives involving human agency   stories of heroes and antiheroes   and dramatic events. Looking for (or reading about) deeper structures is far less enjoyable. It is therefore unsurprising that history books on turning points   wars and global crises   continue to rank at the top of our bestseller lists. There are now even books on specific years declared historical turning points by their authors: 1917, 1979 and so on. Some of them do show that the study of turning points can also take into account deeper causes. One of the most striking is Ian Kershaw s Fateful Choices on the inflection points of the second world war, such as Britain s decision to fight Nazi Germany, Hitler s invasion of the Soviet Union and Japan s attack on Pearl Harbor, which carefully addresses the structural conditions and constraints under which wartime leaders operated. Indeed, events and structures are not mutually exclusive. We should, in every case, acknowledge the relevance of both. As historian Reinhart Koselleck once noted:  The processual character of modern history cannot be comprehended other than through the reciprocal explanation of events through structures, and vice versa.  Structural economic, social and political conditions shape events. But on some junctures, events, such a political revolutions or major wars, can profoundly shape structures. The rare occasion when an event gains structural significance constitutes a historical inflection point. Today, world leaders are right to warn that we are facing such a historical inflection point, a global crisis. Yet, to fully understand it, to resolve it, we must not ignore its deeper structural causes, which often reach back to the end of the cold war and beyond. Among them are the resurgence of nationalism, cultural nativism and revanchism, now shaping political cultures around the world; unchecked neoliberal excess and exploitation, creating unsustainable inequalities; and the erosion of a rules-based international order, undermined by both liberal and illiberal powers over the last decades   all fueling wars and dividing societies. Noticing that we are at an inflection point is not enough. To overcome it, we need to tackle these underlying structural problems, which inevitably will be a slow process, not a dramatic deed. History is a long game.",

        "content": "Defendants, Nuremberg Trials US Army (Public Domain) The Nuremberg trials (1945-6), held in N rnberg (Nuremberg), Germany, were a series of trials involving the senior surviving Nazis to hold them accountable for waging war and committing war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Second World War (1939-45). 22 Nazis were tried, with 19 found guilty and sentenced to either death by hanging or lengthy prison terms. The first Nuremberg trials were conducted from November 1945 to October 1946, and then, a second phase, which involved a much larger number of defendants, was conducted from November 1946 to April 1949. The Nuremberg trials were the first in history where the victors in a war sought to make senior figures from the losing side accountable for their actions. The trials were filmed and contributed greatly to our understanding of how WWII was conducted and revealed both the irrefutable evidence for and enormous scale of such atrocities as the Holocaust. The first month of the trials, the initial proceedings only, were hosted in the Supreme Court Building in Berlin, but they moved on 20 November to the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg. The Palace of Justice was selected because it had been the heart of Nazi show trials against enemies of the Third Reich, the city was the home of the Nuremberg Rally, the infamous annual Nazi Party congress, and the complex had the practical advantage of an adjoining prison where the defendants were detained. Remove Ads Advertisement The International Military Tribunal At the close of WWII, the victorious Allies of France, Britain, the United States, and the USSR, as agreed by their respective leaders at a conference in Moscow back in October 1943, jointly formed an International Military Tribunal (IMT) to bring German Nazi war criminals to justice. There were some calls to have judges from neutral nations head the IMT, but the allied leaders were determined to be directly involved in getting their pound of flesh. The idea of the trials was supported by a number of other nations besides the four main powers. The legacy of the Nuremberg trials included raising awareness of the victims of Nazism & establishing a legal framework to prosecute war criminals. The panel that would decide the fate of the defendants brought before the IMT consisted of one judge and one prosecutor from each of the four nations mentioned above. The judging panel was presided over by the British judge Lord Justice Geoffrey Lawrence, described by one American lawyer as \"like God...Hollywood would have cast him\" (MacDonald, 23). The chief Soviet judge was I. T. Nikitchenko, the French lead judge was Henri Donnedieu de Vabres, and the US judge was Francis B. Biddle. The legal proceedings followed the common law practice applied in the United States and Britain. Translators worked in the courtroom, and everyone present had access to a set of headphones. There was a large screen to show the court relevant film clips and statistical information. 250 journalists attended the court sessions, and the whole proceedings were filmed and sound recorded. Remove Ads Advertisement Nuremberg Trials Judges U.S. Army (CC BY-NC-SA) In the closing stages of the war, Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), Joseph Goebbels (1897-1945), and Heinrich Himmler (1900-1945) had all committed suicide, but there remained 24 senior Nazi figures whom the Allies were determined to bring to justice. The group was selected not only for their individual roles but also as representatives of particular Nazi institutions. Before the trials could begin, Robert Ley (1890-1945), head of the German Labour Front, committed suicide, and Gustav Krupp (1870-1950), an industrialist who had used forced labour, was considered too physically frail to stand trial. The 22 remaining defendants faced four charges, as expressed in the Oxford Companion to World War II, they were: Count 1: Contributing to a common plan or conspiracy to wage war Contributing to a common plan or conspiracy to wage war Count 2: Crimes against peace Crimes against peace Count 3: War crimes (e.g. violations of the Geneva Convention such as the abuse and murder of prisoners of war, use of prisoners for labour, destruction of private property, and devastation of property and places with no military justification) War crimes (e.g. violations of the Geneva Convention such as the abuse and murder of prisoners of war, use of prisoners for labour, destruction of private property, and devastation of property and places with no military justification) Count 4: Crimes against humanity (e.g. the murder of civilian populations, use of slave labour, the forced deportation of civilians, and the persecution of specific social, political, religious, and racial groups) Counts 1 and 2 proved problematic to define, and therefore it was difficult to find the defendants either innocent or guilty of them. This is hardly surprising considering the debate amongst historians ever since as to why and how WWII started and how far one should go back exactly in order to discover the causes of WWII, causes which could be attributed in some cases to both the victors and losers. The court essentially considered counts 1 and 2 as involving actions such as breaking international treaties and invading and occupying free countries. Much easier to establish were cases of counts 3 and 4, although even here there was the added complication that the victors had themselves been guilty of what would today be called war crimes, for example, the Allied bombing of Germany, submarine attacks on unarmed vessels, and the Katyn Forest massacre of Polish prisoners of war by USSR forces. Certain facts were taken as given, such as that Hitler had fully intended to start a world war. In addition, such Nazi organisations as the Gestapo (secret police), the SS (Schutzstaffel), and SA (Sturmabteilung) were condemned as criminal organisations. Remove Ads Advertisement Palace of Justice, Nuremberg US Army (Public Domain) The judges not only benefitted from the cross-examination of the defendants but also the testimony of around 360 witnesses (including both victims of and members of the Nazi regime) and a huge quantity of incriminating documents, official and otherwise, including indisputable photographs, sound recordings, and films, such as those taken at concentration and death camps. As noted by Dr Robert Kempner, a lawyer who had fled the Nazi regime: One of the biggest helps to us was the German bureaucratic sense   they kept everything and they even made publications and films and lot of material had been discovered by our Allied search teams. Some of the people like General Governor Frank of Poland was so anxious to show his friend Hitler after the war what he has done that he kept diaries, volumes and volumes and volumes. In fact he had written his own indictment. (Holmes, 593) It is important to note, however, that the documentation for Nuremberg was compiled in order to support the legal case that the defendants were guilty of one or more of the four counts (and not to create a comprehensive reconstruction of past events as, say, a historian would do). There was, too, a degree of negotiation between the various national judges regarding particular defendants   the USSR judge, for example, wanted Rudolf Hess hanged while his fellow judges preferred a prison sentence   but there was a conscious effort on all parties to deliberate with as much fairness as possible given the seriousness of the trials and the world's scrutiny of them. To this end, the defendants were collectively represented by a legal counsel, Otto Kranzenb hler, and permitted individual lawyers to present their defence.

G ring was by far the most charismatic of those on trial, and he eloquently justified his past actions, although, in the process, he did no more than reveal his total lack of conscience for the gravity of them. According to Speer, G ring told him he was convinced the \"victors would undoubtedly kill him but that within fifty years his remains would be laid in a marble sarcophagus and he would be celebrated by the German people as a national hero and martyr\" (Speer, 681). Those who had belonged to the army or navy remained adamant that they should not be on trial at all since they were obeying military orders. Similarly, the civilians believed their actions, no matter how despicable, had been covered by the oath of loyalty they had once been obliged to swear to Hitler. Others pointed out that those in government should not be judged by standards usually applied to private individuals. Another argument of defence was that the victors had no legal right to put the losers on trial in the first place. Some, like Rosenberg and Streicher, were, in any case, completely unrepentant of their past actions. Dr Franz Blaha Giving Evidence at Nuremberg Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The simplistic, brutal thinking, or rather lack of thinking, of SS men like Kaltenbrunner and Frank was self-evident. Frick refused to testify at all during his trial. Speer cleverly tried to distance himself from his simpler and more notorious colleagues, constructing for himself a case that suggested he had merely been sucked into Nazism by Hitler's powerful personality. Indeed, Speer was one of the few to accept his guilt (although he is now known to have lied about his lack of knowledge of the Holocaust), or at least accept his part in what he described as a \"collective responsibility\" (Dear, 808) for the war and its consequences. Finally, Hess seemed on the fringes of lunacy, although he was not clinically diagnosed as insane. Hess annoyed G ring, his immediate neighbour in the dock, with his constant fidgeting and odd bursts of laughter. All in all, the 22 men looked rather pathetic in their civilian suits. Speer noted the effect of the absence of costume: \"For years I had been accustomed to seeing all these defendants in magnificent uniforms, either unapproachable or jovially expansive. The whole scene now seemed unreal; sometimes I imagined I was dreaming\" (678). The public and press were also surprised by how ordinary these arch-criminals looked. The novelist Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966) noted that only Kaltenbrunner looked anything like a criminal. Remove Ads Advertisement Each defendant was tried in turn, and even those who were cockiest at the beginning, such as G ring, were effectively silenced by the overwhelming mass of evidence against them. Indeed, the evidence was often so horrific and so repetitive that some journalists questioned the necessity of presenting it in such a methodical manner. Ultimately, through the course of the trial, the majority of the defendants themselves realised, if they had not done so already, that they had no defence against the charges brought before them. Final Sentences The defendants finally heard their fate on 1 October 1946. G ring committed suicide by swallowing a potassium cyanide pill a few hours before he was to be hanged. G ring's body was cremated, and his ashes were thrown in the ordinary rubbish. Those others who had been sentenced to death were hanged two weeks later on 16 October in the prison at Nuremberg. As a soldier, Keitel asked to be shot, but his request was denied. The bodies of the hanged men were cremated, and their ashes were scattered on the estuary of the Isar River. Those given prison terms at Spandau Prison in Berlin served various lengths of those terms, depending on their health. The last prisoner was Rudolph Hess, who committed suicide at the age of 93. Corpse of Joachim von Ribbentrop US Army (Public Domain) Subsequent Proceedings From November 1946 to April 1949, a further 185 Nazi war criminals faced trials organised by the United States military. These trials, conducted alone by the US authorities, are known as the US Nuremberg Military Tribunals. The majority of the defendants faced charges related to the inhuman treatment of, medical experimentation upon, and murder of civilians in Nazi concentration camps and the exploitation of civilians as labourers in industry. Of these defendants, 131 were found guilty, with 24 receiving the death sentence and the rest given prison terms. There were other post-WWII trials of war criminals, notably the Far East war crime trials, which dealt with Japanese war criminals, and trials in specific countries, particularly in Poland and the USSR. Germany conducted several denazification trials. There were also some reversals of earlier verdicts. Schacht was sentenced to eight years of hard labour (but only served two), while Alfred Jodl was exonerated by a German denazification court in 1953. By 1949, \"the Allies had convicted 5,025 people\" (Hite, 341). Many Nazi war criminals escaped capture, but the search for them went on, and some were ultimately brought to justice, often decades later. Such a figure, one of the chief administrators of the Holocaust, was Adolf Eichmann (1906-1962), apprehended in Argentina in 1960, tried in Israel, and then hanged. The legacy of the Nuremberg trials and those which followed included raising awareness of the victims of Nazism and establishing a framework on which international laws could be agreed upon. These laws could be used to hold leaders responsible for their actions and act as a deterrent to war crimes being committed. The Nuremberg trials provided a precedent, for example, for the trial of war criminals following the conflicts in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.",

        "title": "War of Jenkins' Ear: How One Man's Ear Started a Colonial War Between Empires",
        "content": "Battle of Cartagena de Indias, 1741 Unknown Artist (Copyright) The War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748) was a colonial conflict fought between Great Britain and Spain, primarily in the Caribbean and off the coast of South America. Looking to protect its interests in the West Indies, Britain provoked a war with Spain, one of its biggest colonial rivals, citing the mistreatment of one Captain Robert Jenkins, who was detained   and allegedly mutilated   by Spanish coast guards as they searched his ship for smuggled goods. In 1739, British Vice Admiral Edward Vernon sailed a fleet into the Caribbean, where he won some victories before his eventual defeat at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1741. After that climactic battle, the war fizzled out as the British soon had their hands full with other conflicts, such as the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748) in Europe and King George's War (1744-1748) in North America. Background Since the conclusion of Queen Anne's War (1702-1713), the European colonial powers in North America had enjoyed a relative period of peace. This was largely the work of Sir Robert Walpole, the leading British politician of the day, who became prime minister in 1721. Walpole and his Whig government believed that the British Empire would profit more from avoiding wars, both on the continent and overseas. Without the burdensome cost of military upkeep, Walpole was able to lower taxes while simultaneously working to pay off the national debt, with a sinking fund. Though many celebrated this pacifist policy, it was opposed by the Tories in Parliament, who feared that a non-combative Britain would soon fall behind its rivals, particularly in the Americas. The French, for example, were steadily expanding their influence in the West Indies, growing rich off their sugar plantations there. Should French meddling in the region go unopposed, then France would surely dominate the lucrative West Indies trade, at the expense of Britain's imperial interests. For these reasons, the Tories demanded a show of military force before it was too late. Remove Ads Advertisement Spain's overseas empire was not as powerful as it once was & was viewed by the British as bloated, decadent, & ripe for the taking. But even the hawkish Tories were aware that a direct war with France could lead to a long and costly struggle. Instead, they decided to assert their influence in the West Indies by picking on another target they deemed to be weaker: Spain. For centuries, the Spanish had dominated commerce in the West Indies with a trade network connected by four major ports: Veracruz, Portobelo, Cartagena de Indias, and Havana. But Spain's overseas empire was not as powerful as it once was and was viewed by the British as bloated, decadent, and ripe for the taking. Britain's hostility towards Spain was also fueled by an anti-Catholic, anti-Spanish stereotype called the 'Black Legend', in which Spaniards were painted as cruel and greedy brutes. For these reasons, the Tories clamored for a war with Spain, both to assert British dominance in the West Indies and to send a message to France by beating up its weaker ally. The Spanish, for their part, were not blind to Britain's expansionist desires and spent the period of peace watching the other colonial power with unease. Their suspicions seemed confirmed when, in 1732, the British founded a new colony, Georgia, right on the doorstep of Spanish Florida, increasing tensions on the mainland as well. Amidst all these rising tensions, Britain and Spain continued to trade in the West Indies. However, Spanish ports often imposed high tariffs on their goods, leading to an increase in smuggling. British smugglers would load up on Caribbean goods, particularly sugar, and take them to the Thirteen Colonies, where these luxuries were always in high demand. To crack down on such practices, the Spanish coast guard often patrolled the Caribbean Sea, stopping and searching any British vessel suspected of carrying contraband. Remove Ads Advertisement Map of Spanish Main & West Indies c.1720 Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) On 9 April 1731, a Spanish coast guard ship stopped one such vessel, the Rebecca, which had taken on quantities of sugar in Jamaica and was now bound for London. As the Spanish sailors searched the Rebecca, they detained its crew, including the captain, Robert Jenkins. Jenkins, according to his own disposition and some other accounts, was tied to the ship's mast with a rope around his neck and was hoisted into the air three times. The Spanish captain then sliced Jenkins's left ear with his cutlass, which was then torn off by another Spanish sailor. After threatening to treat King George II of Great Britain (reign 1727-1760) in the same manner, the Spaniards then left the Rebecca, returned to their own ship, and sailed off. The Rebecca continued on to London, where the one-eared Jenkins proceeded to tell his story to all who would listen. The story made some traction and was reported in several newspapers   including the Pennsylvania Gazette, edited by an up-and-coming Benjamin Franklin   but the scandal did not fully break until 1738. That year, Jenkins was granted an audience with the Privy Council and even appeared before King George II himself. According to one   likely apocryphal   version of events, Jenkins presented the king with his severed ear pickled in a jar as proof of his sorrowful mistreatment. Jenkins' tale outraged the British public, seeming to confirm their 'Black Legend' prejudices regarding Spanish cruelty. The Tories gained ground in Parliament, politicizing the incident to paint Walpole's Whig government as weak. In March 1739, Parliament passed a vote formally asking the king to seek redress from Spain, on behalf of both Jenkins and other British merchants who claimed to have been similarly mistreated. After Spain refused Britain's demands for restitution, George II declared war on 15 June 1739, an act that was ratified by Parliament four months later. Remove Ads Advertisement Vernon Arrives in the West Indies Shortly after the declaration of war, on 20 July 1739, British Vice Admiral Edward Vernon set sail for the West Indies with a fleet of Royal Navy warships. He arrived at Antigua in early October and immediately set about disrupting Spanish trade in the region. At the end of the month, he dispatched three ships under Captain Thomas Waterhouse to attack the Spanish port of La Guira in present-day Venezuela and to burn all the Spanish ships in the harbor. Aware that he could not simply blast his way into the port, Waterhouse decided to use deception to gain entry and ordered his vessels to hoist the Spanish flag. The Spaniards, however, had long been expecting an attack and were not fooled by the ruse. As soon as Waterhouse's three ships came within range of their port guns, the Spanish opened fire. The British ships took heavy damage and were forced to withdraw, limping back to Jamaica for repairs. Despite this setback, Vernon was undeterred. On 20 November, he sailed to Portobelo (in present-day Panama) with six ships of the line and captured it in under 24 hours. The British occupied Portobelo for three weeks, destroying its fortifications and seizing the two 20-gun coast guard ships in its harbor as prizes. Capture of Portobelo Samuel Scott (Public Domain) The victory at Portobelo was lauded across the British Empire; the capture of a major Spanish port was seen as a great success. Vernon was promoted to admiral, and the Walpole government was pressured into providing additional resources for the war effort. In the spring of 1740, Vernon looked to keep the momentum going by attacking another of the major Spanish ports, Cartagena de Indias, in present-day Colombia. Cartagena, if captured, would be an even more impressive prize than Portobelo. The city itself was heavily fortified and home to over 10,000 people. Its harbor, considered by some observers to be among the finest in the world, was where the Spanish galleons came to take on great quantities of gold and silver from the mines of Peru. Its capture, therefore, would greatly weaken Spain's hold on the West Indies trade. On 13 March 1740, Vernon arrived outside Cartagena with several ships of the line, 3 bomb vessels, 2 fire ships, and multiple transports carrying infantry. After spending a few days reconnoitering the position of the nearest Spanish fleet, Vernon ordered his bomb ships to begin bombarding the city. The Spanish, who had set up a temporary shore battery, returned fire and were able to prevent transport vessels carrying 400 British soldiers from landing. Vernon, finding the city's defenses stronger than anticipated, soon withdrew. His plans frustrated by the guns of Cartagena, Vernon sought to regain his mojo with another easy victory. On 22 March, he attacked the fortress of San Lorenzo on the Chagres River in Panama. His bomb ships pounded the fortress into submission, and the British admiral accepted the Spanish commander's surrender two days later. Like they had done at Portobelo, the British spent the next few weeks destroying San Lorenzo's fortifications and seizing guns, boats, and anything else of military value. Emboldened by this success, Vernon returned to Cartagena de Indias on 3 May, only to find that the Spanish had not been idle in his absence. A new viceroy, Sebasti n de Eslava y Lazaga, had arrived from Spain along with hundreds of seasoned reinforcements, boosting the port city's garrison to somewhere between 3 to 4,000 men (the defenders included 600 Indigenous archers). Having anticipated Vernon's coming, the Spanish arrayed six of their own ships of the line in the harbor to oppose him. This unexpected readiness gave Vernon pause. Rather than roll the dice on a battle and risk throwing away his earlier gains, he decided to once again withdraw to more thoroughly prepare for an attack. He would spend the next half year building an expedition force, one of the largest that a European power had yet deployed in the Americas. Remove Ads Advertisement Battle of Cartagena de Indias As many as 18,000 men died during the 67 days Vernon spent outside Cartagena's walls, most of them from disease. By the end of the year, Vernon had organized a military expedition worthy of Cartagena de Indias' strong defenses. He had put together a fleet of 124 ships, including 29 ships of the line, 22 frigates, several bomb ships, fire ships, and hospital ships, and over 80 transport vessels. The army component of the expedition consisted of 12,000 men, including two regiments of British regular infantry as well as 6,000 royal marines. This number also included four battalions of colonial troops   3,600 men in total   who had been raised in the Thirteen Colonies. Under the competent leadership of Governor Alexander Spotswood of Virginia, these colonial soldiers were set to rendezvous with Vernon's fleet in Jamaica before the entire force completed its journey to Cartagena. But no sooner had Vernon laid out his grand plans than dire complications arose. In June 1740, Governor Spotswood died in Annapolis, depriving the colonial battalions of their leader. Six months later, Lord Cathcart, who had been slotted to serve as commander-in-chief of the expedition's land forces, also fell ill and died while crossing the Atlantic from London. To make matters worse, as the expedition gathered in Jamaica, the ships' crews and the soldiers aboard the transports began to suffer from diseases like scurvy, typhus, and dysentery. By January 1741, sickness had already killed 500 men and incapacitated 1,500 more. After forcing 300 enslaved Africans into service to replace his dead sailors, Vernon raised anchor, and his formidable fleet set sail for Cartagena de Indias. The Spaniards, meanwhile, were readying themselves to meet this threat. In charge of the city's defense was Admiral Blas de Lezo, a man who was already a veritable legend on the high seas; having lost an arm, a leg, and an eye in previous battles, he was known as Patapalo, or 'Pegleg', and Mediohombre, or 'Half-man' (at least, he was referred to as such in later sources; there is scant evidence he was known by these nicknames in his own lifetime). Aware that he was heavily outnumbered, de Lezo hoped to hold out long enough to wear the British down through attrition, betting that, unused to the tropical diseases, their numbers would quickly dwindle. On 13 March 1741, the British expedition arrived outside Cartagena. With Lord Cathcart dead, there was no central army commander, and Vernon often found himself bickering with the army officers. Still, the British commanders agreed that any attack from the ocean would be impossible, as Cartagena's walls were too strong. Instead, they would have to gain entry through a narrow, deep-water channel called Boca Chica and assault the city's outer defenses from there. This channel, however, was well-defended by two bastions: Fort San Jose on one side and Fort San Luis on the other. Blas de Lezo Unknown Artist (CC BY) For the next several weeks, Vernon directed all his firepower on Fort San Luis. Eventually, the British made a breach in its walls and landed their infantry and royal marines in preparation for an assault. On 5 April, the British attacked Fort San Luis by both land and sea. But when the British regulars poured in through the breach, they found the Spanish defenders gone; de Lezo had pulled his men back to the inner fortification of Castillo San Felipe de Barajas the previous night. Though the British had seized control of the city's outer fortifications, it had taken them a month to do so   with more men falling sick and dying every day, they were running out of time. In his desperation to conclude the siege, Vernon drew up a plan for a risky frontal assault on Castillo San Felipe. In the early morning hours of 20 April, 2,000 British and colonial soldiers under Colonel John Grant attempted to storm the fort with ladders. They ran right into the waiting muskets of 1,000 Spanish soldiers, who de Lezo had entrenched below the walls of the fort proper. Repeated volleys of the Spanish muskets stopped the British assault in its tracks, a situation made worse when Cartagena's cannons began to open fire. Once the British began to waver, the Spanish leapt from their trenches and drove them back with a spirited bayonet charge. Remove Ads Advertisement By the time the battle was over, the British had lost 600 men, including Colonel Grant, who was killed. Vernon saw the writing on the wall and realized he had neither the time nor the men for another attack. On 9 May, he lifted the siege and returned to Jamaica. As many as 18,000 of his men died during the 67 days he spent outside Cartagena's walls, most of them from disease. The Spanish lost less than 2,000. Of the colonial troops who had served under Vernon, barely 300 survived to return to the Thirteen Colonies. One of these was Lawrence Washington, the elder half-brother of George Washington, future first president of the United States. Lawrence had been sufficiently impressed with his commanding admiral to name his property in Virginia 'Mount Vernon' in his honor. Vernon himself had reached the zenith of his military career. After lackluster success in 1742, he was recalled to Britain. The Walpole government, too, could not survive the disaster of the Cartagena expedition, and Walpole resigned as prime minister in 1742. Thus, the Spanish victory at Cartagena marked the most important moment of the war, not only thwarting Britain's expansionist ambitions but also shaking up its government. Edward Vernon Thomas Gainsborough (Public Domain) War in Florida & Georgia As Vernon was grappling with the Spaniards in the West Indies, warfare also broke out in North America, between the British colony of Georgia and Spanish Florida. Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1739, Major General James Oglethorpe, the founder of Georgia, was instructed by King George II to  annoy the subjects of Spain in the best manner  (quoted by APUSH). Heeding this royal decree, Oglethorpe led 200 men into Florida in December, seizing forts Picolata and San Francisco de Pupo, both situated west of St. Augustine. In May 1740, Oglethorpe returned to Florida with 1,200 men, including Georgia militia and Indigenous allies from the Creek, Chickasaw, and Uchee nations. They laid siege to St. Augustine itself, but due to logistical difficulties, they were forced to lift the siege in July. Oglethorpe returned to Georgia, where he built a fort on the Frederica River in preparation for the inevitable Spanish counterattack. Such an attack would manifest in the spring of 1742 when Manuel de Montiano, governor of Florida, led 4,000 men into Georgia. On 18 July 1742, the Spanish were advancing along the road to Fort Frederica when they encountered a contingent of Georgia rangers and Native American warriors. Taken by surprise, the Spanish were soon driven back. Oglethorpe took advantage of this small victory by leading the rest of his men out of the fort in pursuit of the retreating Spanish. That same day, he caught up with them, and the two forces clashed at the Battle of Bloody Marsh. Familiar with the terrain, Oglethorpe's Georgia militia and Native American warriors took cover in the dense vegetation, giving them clear shots at the Spanish troops who remained out in the open. When his men started running low on ammunition, Montiano ordered a retreat and ultimately withdrew back into Florida. In March 1743, Oglethorpe led yet another raid into Florida with the goal of capturing St. Augustine. However, he once again met with failure and retreated back into Georgia. This marked the end of the fighting along the Georgia-Florida border for the remainder of the war. End of War By and large, Vernon's failed assault on Cartagena de Indias marked the end of the war. Shortly after that, the War of Jenkins' Ear   as the conflict would come to be called   would be overshadowed by other wars breaking out all over the world. In Europe, Britain had been drawn into the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740, and in 1744, it would face off with France in North America in King George's War. Though Britain and Spain remained at war, the subsequent battles were more associated with these other conflicts, except for minor privateer actions in the West Indies. It was not until 1748 that the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended all these wars. The treaty stipulated that the situation in the West Indies return to the way it had been before the war, and that British smuggling in the region cease. Thus, the War of Jenkins' Ear was effectively a Spanish victory.",

Written at a time when Spanish authorities had been and still were actively undermining Aztec culture and beliefs, the Florentine Codex represents an attempt to document and preserve a past and people being systematically censored. It is the product of many minds in collaboration, written in two different languages by numerous scribes and illuminated by a number of artists employing a uniquely syncretic style of illustration, all of which comes together to create a multifaceted depiction of the culture, language, and history of Aztec civilization immediately following the fall of the empire. Remove Ads Advertisement Contents The Florentine Codex was completed sometime between the fall of 1575 and the spring of 1577 after nearly 30 years in the making. Composed of 12 illuminated books with a total of 2,446 pages and 2,472 illustrations, it is widely attributed to a Franciscan friar known as Fray Bernardino de Sahag n (1499-1590). Though the modern title of the codex comes from the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, where it is housed today, scholars do not know what the original title was at the time of its completion. Sahag n himself referred to the text variously in his native Spanish as doze libros ( \"twelve books\"), obra (\"work\"), and, perhaps most expansively, Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva Espa a (\"General History of the Things of New Spain\"). While the codex certainly contains history, its scope is greater than even that title might suggest. The contents of the Florentine Codex are summarized below: Book 1: Prologue and the Gods Book 2: Ceremonies of the Aztec Calendar Book 3: Origin of the Gods and Mythology Book 4: Astrology and Divinatory Practices Book 5: Omens Book 6: Rhetoric and Moral Philosophy Book 7: Natural Philosophy and Celestial Phenomena (Sun, Moon, and Stars) Book 8: Lords of Tenochtitlan, Tlaltelolco, Tetzcoco, and Huexotla, Education and Customs of These Lords Book 9: Merchants, Craftsmen, and Artisans Book 10: The People, Occupations, and Anatomy Book 11: Earthly Things, Natural History Book 12: Conquest of Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco from the Indigenous Perspective The folios of this impressive work include text in two languages: Spanish, the language of the intended audience of the codex, and Nahuatl, the language of the Indigenous peoples of Mexico. While the text is bilingual, neither language represents a translation of the other. Instead, the texts exist in parallel, the Spanish frequently interpreting, abbreviating, adding to, or omitting information from the content of the Indigenous language. For this reason, modern scholars have stressed the need to read the two texts in conjunction rather than one on behalf of the other: Though the entries can be read side by side, their meanings are not always in harmony. There is an ebb and flow in the presence of the Spanish and Nahuatl texts; sometimes there is less written in one language than the other, sometimes one is absent from a folio altogether, and even when they are both present, readers might find inconsistencies in their tone, meaning, or content. Remove Ads Advertisement The images in the Florentine Codex integrate artistic elements from native traditions with the conventions of European traditional styles. Alongside the two languages, the Florentine Codex is punctuated with illustrations. The images in the codex include both decorations and compositions; many are painted in vivid color, while others are rendered only in ink outline, but all of them were illustrated by native artists over the course of years. In the 16th century, images were efficient and impactful ways of conveying information across linguistic and ideological barriers and became a common means of communicating messages in the early colonial world. Painted cloths, wall art, prints, banners, and other means of pictorial expression became tools for religious, political, and social communication, especially in the early days when only a few individuals could translate between Nahuatl and Spanish, much less the other languages spoken in Mesoamerica at the time. The images in the Florentine Codex represent an entirely separate mode of communication, and one with which both cultures would have been intimately familiar, though in different ways. In the Nahuatl language, Indigenous painter-writers were known as tlacuiloque (singular tlacuilo), and were heirs to an artistic tradition that stretched back centuries before the European colonization of the Americas. Created by such skilled artisans, the images in the Florentine Codex are stylistic adaptations, integrating artistic elements from native traditions with the format and conventions of the European traditional styles, particularly the convention that favored formal isolation of subjects within the layout of the page. While the presentation of the images is generally more European in style, there are several examples of Aztec artistic conventions in the Florentine Codex. These include the use of curling symbols called \"speech scrolls\" to indicate a speaking individual in a static image, and the practice of depicting seashells on the edges of tendrils of water. Both of these stylistic elements appear in the image of Chalchiuhtlicue from the Codex Borbonicus, which was created by Aztec priests and preserves many pre-Hispanic modes of pictorial representation. Remove Ads Advertisement Chalchiuhtlicue Unknown Artist (Public Domain) While the texts address audiences in the languages of two cultures, the images of the Florentine Codex represent the clearest examples of the cultural syncretism at play in 16th-century Mexico: Such a work could have been produced only in Mesoamerica, where the introduction of the Roman alphabet and European art style made sense to people who had been writing and painting with ink and natural colors for centuries. It is among the rare first manuscripts to represent indigenous cultures that involved indigenous people. (Peterson & Terraciano, 13) Sahag n's Collaborators While Fray Bernardino de Sahag n is considered the author of the Florentine Codex, it was actually a product of a substantial collaborative effort and featured the contributions of people from Mexico's Indigenous communities as its primary content. That being said, the codex would have been impossible without Sahag n, whose role included writing, coordinating, editing, and translating, in addition to proposing the actual idea of and advocating for the project itself. Considering the extensive subject matter and sheer volume of scribal and artistic labor involved, one man, even one as ambitious as Sahag n, could not have accomplished the ambition of this project alone. Sahag n was a teacher and missionary absolutely dedicated to the conversion of the native people of Mexico to Catholic Christianity. He believed that in order to accomplish his goal, he had to understand the belief systems, culture, and language that had preceded the colonial influence of Spain. After all, missionaries could not ideologically eclipse a religion they could not recognize and could not convey Christianity without sharing a common language with their prospective converts. But Sahag n and his peers in the church had come to Mexico after the conquest and had little to no knowledge of Aztec civilization. In order to accomplish his ultimate evangelical aim, Sahag n had to rely on information from those he sought to convert. Remove Ads Advertisement Aztec Musicians Madman2001 (Public Domain) Beyond just content, Sahag n needed help with the recording process. The nearly 2,500-page Florentine Codex was drafted multiple times over the course of three decades through the concerted efforts of a number of steady-handed and literate men. These men were intellectuals, born in Mexico to Indigenous parents and then educated at colleges sponsored and staffed by the Spanish church. They, like Sahag n himself, were fluent in Nahuatl, Spanish, and Latin, and were instrumental in the creation of the codex, a process that occurred largely in the later years of Sahag n's life, when age rendered the friar incapable of writing anything himself with his own trembling hands. Though he was certainly the author of the prologues and parts of the Spanish text, those sections represent less than half of the content of the Florentine Codex. Creating the Codex From 1559 to 1565, Sahag n and his collaborators collected what would become the Florentine Codex in conversation with elders in the settlements of Tepepulco and Tlatelolco. During his time in Tepepulco, Sahag n worked with local authorities to assemble a group of approximately twelve elders. These elders had all lived through the cataclysmic arrival of Hern n Cort s and his forces and could offer their knowledge of the pre-Hispanic Aztec culture to Sahag n's project. After the friar and his team of scribal scholars recorded their spoken testimony, the elders offered images representing what they had said. As mentioned above, Aztec tlacuiloque had kept history and culture in pictorial records long before the advent of the Roman alphabet in Mexico. After three years in Tepepulco, Sahag n and his nascent codex were transferred to Tlatelolco, where he once again presented his intentions and requested leaders from among the native peoples. With about ten more elders, all of whom were capable and knowledgeable in Nahuatl and the preconquest customs of the Aztecs, Sahag n and his team proceeded to expand on, clarify, and revise the work. Remove Ads Advertisement Map of the Aztec Empire, c. 1427 1521 Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) When the friar concluded his interviews in Tlatelolco around 1565, his collaboration had produced what is known today as the C dices Matritenses or Madrid Codices, an early draft of the Florentine Codex. Like its later iteration, the Madrid Codices are written in Spanish and Nahuatl, but unlike the Florentine Codex, the 1565 draft is not illustrated and includes three columns of text. The left columns, written in Spanish, encompass Sahag n's notes on the same subjects addressed in the central columns, all of which were written in Nahuatl on specific topics. The columns furthest to the right, which do not appear in the Florentine Codex, articulated Sahag n's lexical notes on the Nahuatl language. The friar had planned to include the third column in the Florentine Codex as well, but a lack of time and support, in Sahag n's own estimation, prevented his culminating work from being the linguistic resource he had intended it to be. At this point, Sahag n describes editing, dividing the content into twelve books and sorting the text into specific chapters and paragraphs. He writes: The Mexicans corrected and added many things to the twelve books as they were being copied anew, in such a way that the first sieve through which my works were strained was that of Tepepulco; the second, that of Tlatelolco; the third, that of Mexico. (Book 2, folios 1v-2r, translated by Garc a Garagarza) Among the hands and minds that sieved his works, the friar mentions a few by name. Though it does not represent a complete list of his Indigenous collaborators, Sahag n mentions Mart n Jacobita, who was director of the colegio of Tlatelolco, Antonio Valeriano, who was a native of Azcapotzalco, and two natives of Cuauhtitlan named Alonso Vegerano and Pedro de San Buenaventura, all of whom were experts in Latin, Spanish, and Nahuatl. In his list of scribes, he includes Diego de Grado and Bonifacio Maximiliano, both natives of Tlatelolco, and Mateo Severino from Xochimilco. Peterson and Terraciano assert that there were many other unnamed collaborators from the communities surrounding Lake Texcoco that contributed to the final product. Sahag n ultimately delivered a book containing far more than was necessary to convert the native population to Christianity. He created a vehicle through which Nahuatl authors and artists of the 16th century can still be heard and seen today. Aztec Agriculture Peter Isotalo (Public Domain) Sahag n's Goals In his prologue to Book 1, Sahag n articulates multiple aims for the practical use of the Florentine Codex. The first of his goals naturally centers on his role in converting the native population. Likening the work of missionaries to physicians tasked with diagnosing and treating illnesses, he claims that as physicians care for the body, priests and confessors are meant to minister to the souls of those whom they aim to convert to Christianity. In order to accomplish that task, he asserts that it was necessary to record accurate accounts of the language and beliefs of the Indigenous peoples of Mexico before the Spanish conquest. These linguistic and anthropological endeavors become the other stated goals of the codex. Sahag n makes it clear that one of his goals is to demonstrate the worth of the peoples who had suffered devastation at the hands of Cort s. The presence of so much Nahuatl language in the codex represents the scope of Sahag n's dedication to this goal. By 1540, well before initiating the project that would become the Florentine Codex, he had already authored a number of sermons in Nahuatl, enough to be delivered at all of the saints' days and Sundays of the year. He had tailored these to the Indigenous people, both the nobility and the lower classes, not just in their language but according to the aptitude he recognized in them at the time. As he learned more, the friar would find that their capacity not only exceeded his expectations but evoked in him a profound respect for their way of life, which would inform and enhance his convictions in his anthropological aim. While it is not clear exactly when this sentiment formed for Sahag n, he makes it clear that one of his goals is to demonstrate the worth of the peoples who had suffered devastation at the hands of Cort s and his forces. Early in the Florentine Codex, Sahag n quotes an Old Testament prophecy attributed to Jeremiah, asserting the similarities between the prophetic portents and the fate of the Indigenous peoples in the conquest of Mexico: Love History?

This people shall destroy you, and your women and children, and everything that you possess; and they shall destroy all your towns and buildings.\" This, to the letter, has happened to these Indians at the hands of the Spaniards. They were so utterly trampled upon and destroyed, with all of their things, that no resemblance was left of what they were before. (Book 1, folio vir, translated by Garagarza) Sahag n further laments that the native peoples are perceived as barbarians despite the fact that their styles of governing, as he puts it, are \"far ahead of many other nations that presume to be highly civilized\" (Book 1, folio vir, translated by Garagarza). Atlalli Aztec Irrigation The Florentine Codex (CC BY-NC-ND) Sahag n continues his praise of the Indigenous people particularly their educational systems, rhetoric, and achievements in arts, sciences, and technologies throughout the rest of the Florentine Codex and even compares the cultures of Mesoamerica to Troy, Rome, Carthage, and Venice, emphasizing their similarities to those highly esteemed civilizations of Europe. While he qualifies all of this praise with a notion of Mesoamerica being a place apart from the influence of God, where the devil has enjoyed prosperity, he nonetheless situates the native peoples of the Americas as kin to the Spanish and as mutual descendants of Adam. Suppression of the Codex In writing to his Spanish audience, whose perspectives likely would have been influenced by biased accounts from the conquistadors, Sahag n went far to assert the worth of the culture and heritage of Mexico's Indigenous population. In some ways, he went much further than would have been comfortable to his fellow Spaniards: For Spanish officials, particularly ecclesiastical authorities, words in native tongues were inherently suspect and images potentially idolatrous; translation itself might camouflage heretical ideas and harbor dangerous political meanings. (Peterson & Terraciano, 14) Almost certainly aware of this idolatrous potential, Sahag n still championed a text largely written in Mexico's native tongue and richly illustrated by Indigenous artists. Even when King Phillip II of Spain (reign 1556-1598) ordered the confiscation of all manuscripts involving Indigenous history and religion in 1577, Sahag n may have withheld a copy of his codex, in defiance of the Crown, and offered to copy and send it again to be sure it was received. The codex was sent to Europe in the year of the decree, was acquired by the Medici family in 1587, and disappeared from the historical record for nearly two centuries. The codex was rediscovered in 1793, but was not actually studied until 1879, and was inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2015.",

        "content": "Bodo was a early 9th-century Frankish farmer. He and his family hailed from a manor owned by the monastery of St.-Germain-des-Pr s near Paris and worked as its tenants. He ploughed the farmlands while his wife, Ermentrude, took care of their household. Their lives give us a lively image of what daily life was like as peasants living in a manor in the Carolingian world of the early Middle Ages. Manors formed the very basic economic and social structure of early medieval Europe. A land estate owned by a feudal lord, not only was the manor the heart of agricultural production, it was also a centre for local political, social, and cultural activities. The monastery of St.-Germain-des-Pr s kept a detailed list of the names of the tenants and other people doing business with them of this period, called the Polyptych. Remove Ads Advertisement Detail of March from Les Tr s Riches Heures Mark Cartwright (CC BY-NC-SA) To manage their large estate, the then abbot of the monastery, Irminon (c. 820s), compiled this list, and the text is now preserved in a 9th-century manuscript in Paris (Biblioth que nationale de France, Ms Latin 12832). Along with Bodo were 10,000 other names located in 25 different villages, detailing their names, occupations, and most importantly, the sort of obligations (rent and labour) owed to the monastery. It was from this fiscal data that we can track and reconstruct the life of Bodo and his wife as well as their three unnamed children. Social Status & Experience Before discovering details of their daily lives, it is important to first note the social status of Bodo and his family, as this was very important in determining what was expected of them. Bodo and his family were not slaves and thus enjoyed a degree of freedom, but it is also true that the state of being enslaved and free was not binary in the Middle Ages, and often, it is more precise to talk about the degree of (un)freeness or freedom a person enjoyed under various circumstances. Remove Ads Advertisement it is crucial to note the state of being enslaved and free was not binary Christianity formally forbids slavery, but in actual practice it was more about how free and (un)free was one's experience in social, economic and political spaces since the breaking down of the western parts of the Roman Empire. In the old Romanland that now belonged to the various Germanic tribes and the kingdoms they established, there were coloni, free framers only in a sense that they were not subjected to anyone s servitude, but they were, nevertheless, bounded by and depended on their lands and thus had little mobility. Then we have serfs, who were attached to and depended on the estates of their owners. While a serf could not be sold as a person, they were sometimes exchanged during a land transaction. Other than the land labour, serfs also had to perform other household work for their owners. Lastly, there were free peasants who owned the land and were responsible for their own gains and losses. As freemen, they did not owe any rent or labour and could even provide paid work to feudal rulers. Their independence, however, was fragile, as any crop failure or any unfortunate circumstances like the population plundering from other lords could lead to them being subjected to a feudal ruler and becoming coloni or even serfs. Polyptych of Irminon, folio 2r Biblioth que nationale de France. D partement des Manuscrits (Public Domain) Bodo and his family were attached to the monastery and had a variety of obligations to it. This was what the Polyptych of Irminon recorded. They lived in one of the villages with other peasants of similar status. We know some of Bodo's neighbours  names: Frambert, Ermoin, and Ragenold, and they all had their own family. The circle of peasant farmers and workers was likely the most common social relationship Bodo could forge. He might meet the estate manager from time to time, and even the people from the monastery itself. But the monastery was a closed community, and outside visits were a rarity. Only a traveling merchant might visit the monastery on occasions, although even a royal visit was not impossible, and for someone like Bodo, the sight of a great king or noble marching on the road, perhaps with a newly received gift from a distant Caliph such as an elephant, could be the view, talk, and memory of a lifetime. Remove Ads Advertisement Daily Routine Bodo and Ermentrude had busy days throughout the year, and only on rare occasions and important festivals or religious holidays could they find some rest and enjoy a break from the many obligations they had. Bodo had to wake up early and go to the farm of the monks with the other peasants, as this was their main labour. They had to bring their own tools for ploughing and certain gifts (eggs, vegetable etc) to bribe the steward there for an easy day. The obligations Bodo shared were divided into the following: Field work, which was a fixed amount of labour on the land, Corv e, meaning unfixed ploughing when needed, and lastly, military service, in the form of paying money or supplying livestock to the soldiers. There was, too, public service, that is, participating in the maintenance of the village infrastructure whenever needed. Any day could be a trial of hardship for Bodo, and the work must often have seemed endless from morning to evening, as one early medieval writer imagined:  Oh sir, I work very hard. I go out in the dawning, driving the oxen to the field and I yoke them to the plough every day I must plough a fall acre or more, after having yoked the oxen and fastened the share and coulter to the plough  Yes, indeed it is very hard work!' (Aelfric, Colloquium, in The Welding of the Race, 449-1066, p95) The Feudal Society in Medieval Europe Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) Ermentrude also had a busy life. She had to work in the workshop with other women, spinning, dyeing, and sewing garments as well as making other daily accessories. Carolingian kings, in their legislation, provided a very detailed list of what was expected of a peasant woman s daily labour: For our women s work, they are to give at the proper time the materials, that is linen, wool, woad, vermillion, madder, wool combs, teasels, soap, grease, vessels, and other objects which are necessary. And let out women s quarters be well look after, furnished with houses and rooms with stoves and cellars, and let them be surrounded by a good hedge, and let the doors be strong, so that the women can do out work properly. (Charlemagne s capitulary, De Villis, c.45) After fulfilling her part of the tenant s obligations, Ermentrude then needed to go to the small family farm and work on it. This included looking after the livestock and watering the vegetables. Only after all these tasks had been completed could she return to her own household to look after the children, prepare meals for them, clean the house, and make new clothes for the family for the winter to come. Remove Ads Advertisement When Bodo returned at the end of the working day, the family would immediately eat supper and then go to bed, for a day s labour was physically exhausting for both adults, and opportunities for rest did not come too often during the working day. Nor would they have much by way of evening entertainment, for after sunset, darkness shrouded the entire house. Sleep was what both men and women who worked tirelessly on the farmlands, workshops, and household needed, for tomorrow would be no different than today or yesterday. February, Les Tres Riches Heures Limbourg Brothers (Public Domain) The Medieval Agricultural Revolution There was a substantial decline in agricultural intensity across the post-Roman West which can be measured by the decrease in buildings, trade networks, and the quality of the agricultural production, both primary like grain and secondary such as coins or pottery. However, by the later first millennium, at least in northwestern Europe, some major trends that had slowly taken place allowed a recovery, if not intensification, of agricultural production. First, instead of the Two-field System, farmers began to adopt the Three-field System. The Two-field System meant farmland was divided into two sections, with crops growing on one half of it while the other half was left ploughed and harrowed but not sowed. Under the new pratice, one third of the land would be sown with winter crops and one third summer ones, allowing greater food production through a more fertile land. As a result, food surpluses became increasingly common and there was a stable growth of population that saw the number of households almost doubled. More farmlands were cultivated and trade beyond the local community started to appear. There was also a small and localized urbanization, as either the villages located in the pre-existing key trading route or recently brought into the commercial network experienced a fair degree of population and infrastructural growth. Remove Ads Advertisement What did all this mean for peasants like Bodo? For once, they would have another way out of the very land that provided their life but also tied them to it. All of Bodo and Ermentrude s three children would have a better chance of surviving the world and more opportunities to explore it. This was not to paint a better picture in general, because by all accounts peasants like Bodo were still very much subjected to economic, social, and political oppression from the powerful. But in some ways that would be eventually transformative of the entire medieval European world, peasants firsthand experienced the benefits of the changes in land production, and their lives became somewhat improved. Conclusion The story of Bodo was reconstructed from the manorial record of the monastery of St.-Germain-des-Pr s. Other than being an important spiritual centre, the monastery also operated as the economic hub of the newly formed Carolingian Empire. Keeping a detailed and accurate record of tenants like Bodo was essential for the purposes of taxation, military service, land transactions, and other forms of economic exchange between the peasants, the monastery, and the court. Regarding the kings and emperors, whose luxurious lifestyle had to be sustained by the labour of the peasants, much has been written on them. Yet 99 percent of medieval people were just like Bodo, or Ermentrude and their three unnamed children, whose destinies were closely tied to the fortune of the land in early medieval Europe, and all we have on them, and on their world, is the Polyptych. While this was but a glimpse into their lives, the Polyptych makes possible to see the working of an early medieval manor, and the people who spent their entire life in it with very little possibilty of ever experiencing the greater outside world.",

Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The Trenches of WWI Despite Germany's hopes that its prepared Schlieffen Plan would win a swift victory over France and its allies, the First World War settled down on the Western Front to a static one of trench warfare. Other fronts developed in Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers poured into these fronts from all sides involved in the conflict, many amongst them keen for action and eager to do their patriotic duty. The public was equally enthusiastic in the early days of the war. One French infantry officer recalls the scene as his train carrying troops to the front set off from Paris: Remove Ads Advertisement  without any signal, the train slowly steamed out of the station. At that moment, quite spontaneously, like a smouldering fire suddenly erupting into roaring flames, an immense clamour arose as the Marseillaise burst from a thousand throats. All the men were standing at the train's windows, waving their k pis. From the track, quais and the neighbouring trains, the crowds waved back Crowds waved back at every station, behind every barrier, and at every window along the road. Cries of 'Vive la France! Vive l'arm e' could be heard everywhere, while people waved handkerchiefs and hats. The women were throwing kissed and heaped flowers on our convoy. The young men were shouting: \"Au revoir! A bient t\" [Goodbye. See you soon!]. (Keegan, 72) A similar zeal for battle was seen across the world and, undeniably, there quickly built up a pressure from peers and society to 'join up and do one's bit', as here recalled by one New Zealand soldier: University classes emptied sports fixtures were abandoned. To be left behind was unthinkable. If your mate was going, then somehow you had to get away too. (Keegan, 242) Sentry Post, Western Front 1918 T.K.Aitkin - Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Canadian soldier Victor Wheeler recalls the impact on local French farmers as war descended on them by chance in October 1914: Remove Ads Advertisement With pick and shovel we dug trenches through beautiful fields of grain, fully realising what damage we were doing to the farmers' hopes of reaping small harvests that would enable them to stem hunger during the coming winter. The patriarch with his ox-drawn plough, the matronly gleaner, and the young woman gathering grass and leaves, stood arms akimbo, wordlessly, helplessly, hopelessly watching. The depressing effect on the morale of the men   to many of whom raising grain on the Western prairie also meant their livelihood   could not be easily dismissed. (Yorke, 28) The reality of trench warfare soon set in. Ernst J nger, a German soldier, gives the following description of the trench he lived and fought in: To rest in, there are dugouts, which have evolved by now from rudimentary holes in the ground to proper enclosed living quarters, with beamed ceilings and plank-cladded walls. The dugouts are about six feet [1.8 m] high, and at a depth where there floors are roughly level with the bottom of the trench outside. In effect, there is a layer of earth on top of them thick enough to enable them to survive oblique hits. In heavy fire, though, they are death-traps The whole thing should be pictured as a huge, ostensibly inert installation, a secret hive of industry and watchfulness, where, within a few seconds of an alarm being sounded, every man is at his post. But one shouldn't have too romantic an idea of the atmosphere, there is a certain prevailing torpor that proximity to the earth seems to engender. (J nger, 40-41) Machine guns and artillery shells caused total carnage amongst infantry troops unimaginatively deployed again and again by their generals to cross the no man's land between rival trench systems. A German soldier, F. L. Cassell, recalls: Remove Ads Advertisement  the shout of the sentry, 'They are coming' Helmet, belt and rifle and up the steps in the trench a headless body. The sentry had lost his life to a last shell there they come, the khaki-yellows, they are not twenty metres in front of our trench They advance slowly fully equipped machine-gun fire tears holes in their ranks. (Keegan, 295) Medical Officer, British Trenches, 1918 T.K.Aitkin - Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) In those trenches between Allied and Turkish troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula, a similar story is recorded by British soldier Vere Hamsworth in a letter home: We spent four days in the front-line trench. We had only a few casualties. We were put there just after a big attack which had partially failed and the ground between our trench and the Turks were strewn with bodies. It strikes me that they will be there for a long time. In this the body and face turn quite black in less than 24 hours and the smell is terrific. The flies   which are everywhere   also add to the general discomfort. (Williams, 37) New weapons used in the trenches, like poison gas shells, caused bewilderment, dismay, and terrible deaths, as here recalled by British soldier Walter Clarke: You didn't know, they were only just shells. But what happened, these shells when they burst they'd drop all on the floor, liquid. And in the morning the mist, there's always a mist there every morning, that was coming into the air and you were breathing it all in. Nobody knew until one or two chaps started being sick and a lot of the fellows were laying about going blind and sores all over their eyes. And then they realised what it was. (Imperial War Museums) The seriously wounded were taken to military hospitals behind the lines, often staffed by volunteer nurses. Britisher Daisy Spickett was one such nurse, and here she explains why she joined the medical services: Remove Ads Advertisement I always had in mind that I wanted to nurse and as soon as I heard of any talk of forming Red Cross Hospitals I began to make enquiries. I heard also that there was a likelihood of the War Office wanting volunteers for military hospitals, and that was what I decided I wanted. It seemed to me the only hope of getting right into the middle of everything, getting abroad and doing whatever was going, and the idea of the Army attracted me   being in the Army. But it seemed to me the thing I wanted more than anything else and that was how I put my name down for military hospitals and got my posting in July 1915. (IWM) Christmas Truce, Illustrated London News Arthur Cadwgan Michael (Public Domain) Even amongst the horrors of the trenches, there were brief respites, the most remarkable being the Christmas truce of 1914, when several separate groups of soldiers along the Western Front met and exchanged gifts with the enemy. Elsewhere, messages of goodwill were simply shouted across no man's land, as here recorded by Lieutenant Edward Hulse:  there were wafted towards us from the trenches opposite the sounds of singing and merry-making, and occasionally the guttural tones of a German were to be heard shouting out lustily, 'A happy Christmas to you Englishmen!' (Lawson-Jones, 91) Trench life, endured for over four years for the lucky ones, came to be seen as an unchanging past, present, and future. Daily life in the trenches was recorded with a sort of disdainful nostalgia in popular songs such as this one written by the Australian soldier and poet Tom Skeyhill: I've a little wet home in the tench; Which the rain-storms continually drench; Blue sky overhead, Mud and clay for a bed, And a stone that we use for a bench. Bully beef and hard biscuits we chew; Shells crackle and scare, But no place can compare With my little wet home in the trench. Remove Ads Advertisement (Yorke, 46) WWI U-Boat & Crew Imperial War Musuems (CC BY-NC-SA) At Sea & in the Air WWI, of course, involved battles at sea and in the air. Alfred Fright, then still a teenager, recalls the greatest time of stress was waiting for any action to happen, as it inevitably would, sooner or later: Whilst you was waiting for it you was absolutely dead scared, dead scared. But once it started it was fine and you seemed to lose it all. But up until that point, as I say, you was dead scared. And I know I've stood on the bridge sometimes and cried with being scared. And also I've stood on the bridge   cos we used to have to do lookouts, you see, that was our job mostly, boys. Course the ship sways that much you go three times that much up at the top mast head you see. And I've stood up there with these glasses to my eyes, froze to death and crying. That's the sort of life it was in them days. (IWM) British officer S. Pawley remembers a battle when he served on board HMS Glasgow: We formed into battle line ahead with the Otranto on our port side at some distance and steamed north. It was not very long before smoke appeared on the horizon and we soon discovered this smoke came from two German heavy cruisers. And we were able to recognise Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. We were not long in closing on the enemy and soon the battle commenced. The Good Hope opened fire, a ranging shot, which fell short and then the battle became general. I was standing on the upper deck at the time; the sea was very rough under a leaden sky. At times the waves came clean overboard, came clean in over. We were hit in several places. One of our mess decks was flooded; the captain's cabin was wrecked; the signalman's arm was blown off in the foretop; holes were knocked in the coal bunkers and we were in a generally poor condition. (IWM) Aircraft became an important means of observation on the enemy and were used as bombers of strategic targets like supply dumps, bridges, and railway lines. Life in the air was glamorous but precarious, as here recalled by Royal Air Corps pilot Frederick Powell: Well I think, not only 40 Squadron, but every RFC Squadron, the centre of the squadron seemed to be in the bar. That may offend a lot of people in these days, but it is perfectly true. And when you think of these boys, with the tensions they lived through, through the day, and they came in, in the evening, and then asked about their best friend, 'Where's he? I miss old George'. 'Oh, he bought it this afternoon'. 'Oh, heavens'. Now the gloom would come into a mess; the morale would die and the reaction immediately was, 'Well, come on chaps, what're you going to have?' That was the sort of spirit that kept going. I still think that it played a magnificent part in keeping up the morale of our troops generally. (IWM) Woman Working in a WWI Ammunitions Factory George P. Lewis - Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Civilians in WWI As millions of men on all sides left their homes to fight, women were encouraged to replace the lost workers, particularly in vital industries like arms manufacturing and agriculture. Working in factories could be dangerous work, as here explained by one visitor to a German ammunition factory: The working conditions were like what they must have been under early capitalism. There was always 'something wrong'. Especially during the night shift. Never a night passed without one or more of the women collapsing at their machines from exhaustion, hunger, illness On many days in winter there would be no heating  (Strachan, 157) Civilian workers could become casualties of unexpected events, such as this explosion in a British weapons factory, recalled by Ethel M. Bilbrough: No news came that night, but next day we heard that it was the most awful explosion of its kind ever known, as a munitions factory in East London at Silverton had caught fire somehow (Ah! How?) and the fire spread until it reached all the explosives and then the whole place was hurled up into the air, and four streets were demolished, and the dead and the dying and the injured lay amongst the ruins, so that when a relief party arrived they hardly knew where to begin. Over 100 people were killed, and more than 400 injured and disabled. (Williams, 53). The Zeppelin bombing raids of WWI involved terrifying new machines that could attack anywhere in the dead of night. Civilians were now brought into the realm of war, no matter how distant the front lines were. David Kirkwood describes a Zeppelin attack on Edinburgh in April 1916: Suddenly a terrifying explosion occurred. Windows rattled, the ground quivered, pictures swung. We all gasped. I ran to the window and saw Vesuvius in eruption. I opened the window. A great flash greeted me from the castle and then, above the roaring, I heard the most dreadful screeching and shouting. (Williams, 41) WWI Zeppelin Leaving its Hangar Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Remembrance The First World War ended in 1918, but for many, the effects would last a lifetime. Injuries, shocking memories, personal losses, and the difficulties of reintegrating into civilian life haunted many. Shell shock, the physical and psychological effects of shell fire, was one such lingering effect of this new and terrible modern warfare, as explained by British soldier Bertram Steward: Love History?

The strain of continual bombardment   continual, not just one bomb and then a quarter of an hour and another one but continual bombardment all the time pounding and pounding away. Now I think that's what people didn't understand, they heard of people having shell shock but what happened was everybody had shell shock who went through that sort of thing. It manifested itself in different ways. One of my friends who went out there, when he came back after the war he was accustomed to shut himself up in his home or in his garden and he wouldn't come out at all and nobody could get him to. He finished up   he was a great athlete, a good boy at school   he finished up in a lunatic asylum and died only within a year or two of the finish of the war. (IWM) For those who survived, the act of remembrance each 11 November helped keep memories of the lost alive and recognise the great sacrifices made. Many poems were written for the fallen, but one of the most enduring is 'For the Fallen' by Laurence Binyon, who himself served as a medical orderly in France:",

        "title": "1918 Flu Pandemic: The Deadliest Pandemic in History",
        "content": "Fort Porter Flu Patient US War Department (Public Domain) The Spanish flu (so-named because the Spanish press openly reported on the outbreak while other World War I belligerents suppressed the news) broke out in March 1918 at Camp Funston, an army camp in Kansas, and struck young, healthy adults with greater ferocity than any other demographic group. Occurring in three waves (March-September 1918, September-December 1918, Spring-Summer 1919) and affecting nearly 500 million people worldwide, the death toll reached 50-100 million people. The conditions of the First World War, poor hygiene, overcrowded hospitals, poor eating habits, and the general lack of knowledge and treatment for viral infections all contributed to its lethality. Origin & Spread The pandemic started in Haskell County, Kansas. Known both for its cattle and hog herds, it was also the flyway for 17 migratory bird flocks. It seems most likely that the birds infected the hogs, and the hogs infected humans. In January-February 1918, Dr. Loring Miner reported the initial cases to the United States Public Health Service. As carriers of the virus, recruits reported for military duty at Camp Funston spread the disease to others in the camp during March-April 1918. Remove Ads Advertisement In younger & stronger people, the immune system responded more intensely, causing the build-up of fluids in the lungs. In this early, springtime phase of the outbreak, despite the hundreds of cases, there were very few deaths. In April, soldiers from Camp Funston began the journey to France, while others were dispatched to other US military installations. The bases, transport trains and ships, and frontlines were crowded and unsanitary, creating ideal conditions for the spread of an airborne, infectious disease. At the peak of the pandemic in October-November 1918, the mortality rate amongst soldiers on the Western Front reached 2%, while reports from India indicated a mortality rate of 10%. The third phase of the pandemic in 1919 was worsened by soldiers returning from the war through ports and military bases along the coast. These types of occurrences became familiar in port cities all around the world. Remove Ads Advertisement The Virus The virus that struck the world in 1918-1919 was the H1N1 influenza A variant. The virus originated in wild waterfowl, which transferred to hogs and pigs, then evolved to be transmitted to humans. Carried through the air from person to person, the virus overwhelmed the immune system by quickly replicating and infecting the upper respiratory system. In younger and stronger people, the immune system responded more intensely, causing severe inflammation and the build-up of fluids in the lungs. With the body weakened, the influenza infection most often led to secondary infections, especially pneumonia. Upon exposure to the influenza virus, symptoms occurred within 2-3 days. The patient suffered from fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, headaches, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting. Unique to the 1918 pandemic was the presence of a bluish tint to the skin (turning to purple near death), known as heliotrope cyanosis. This condition led to the lungs filling with fluid, causing the patient to suffocate. Death usually occurred within 3-5 days of the onset of the illness. The mortality rate was highest amongst the poor, soldiers, health workers, and people working in occupations characterized by crowded working conditions. Remove Ads Advertisement Contributing Conditions In major urban areas, crowded buildings and workplaces and the increasing number of people provided the virus with an abundance of hosts. The overcrowding was often accompanied by poor sanitation, poor water quality, insufficient food supply, and poor personal hygiene. The war zones suffered from extreme overcrowding of soldiers and support personnel at the various military installations. The close living conditions at the camps, the conditions of trench warfare on WWI's Western Front, and troop ships helped the spread of the disease. Furthermore, poor sanitation, lack of proper nourishment, soldiers suffering from a variety of war wounds, and the low to non-existent natural immunity of the soldiers who had no previous exposure to the flu affected the spread. It was no wonder that the most affected demographic during the pandemic, especially in the fall of 1918, was the 20-40-year-olds, particularly soldiers and sailors. The Interior of a Hospital Tent John Singer Sargent (CC BY-NC) Medical science would not make the distinction between bacteria and viruses until the 1930s, and it would not be until 2005 that the 1918 flu virus genome was finally mapped. Quinine treatments, especially in Italy, used in malaria hospital wards, seemed to show some effectiveness as few patients developed the flu, although opponents to the treatment argued the lack of scientific data to support quinine treatments, and malaria patients did get the flu. Aspirin was tried, but too often the doses administered were too high, leading to a build-up of fluids in the lungs and ultimately to death. Remove Ads Advertisement Another medicinal approach was mass vaccination. In England and the United States, doctors used a variety of vaccines, sometimes in combination with each other. The results of the vaccination campaigns were mixed. In 1918, the available vaccines were meant for bacterial infections, which caused some flu patients to become even sicker, while patients receiving a bacterial vaccine for pneumonia seemed to avoid death more successfully. Antibiotics were not available in 1918 to address secondary bacterial infections; the first antibiotic was only introduced after the discovery of penicillin in 1928. Public Health Measures Lacking any effective medical responses to the outbreak, communities relied on public gathering bans, including closures of private businesses, distancing, and masking. Closures included cinemas, theaters, and saloons/bars, however, it was not unusual for saloons to completely ignore orders. Public health officials filed lawsuits to compel businesses to comply, but court rulings were mixed. In some cases, courts ruled that the closure orders of health authorities did not apply, while other courts allowed the closures for a limited time only, as long as the epidemic was present in the community. As the pandemic dragged on, financial losses and job losses for businesses lessened their cooperation with officials. All the restrictions & limitations of conducting business & consumption were cast in patriotic terms. The pandemic did not produce an economic crisis, although late 1918 and early 1919 experienced a mild recession due to the scaling back of war production. The flu most affected leisure and entertainment workplaces, but in 1918-1919, people had little money to spend on those activities. The war had already taught consumers the need to restrict their spending, so the addition of a pandemic had a negligible effect on consumption. Most people labored in industries or agriculture, and illness among workers particularly hurt coal, steel, textile, and copper producers. In some cases, those industries were unable to fill government orders necessary for the war effort. All the restrictions and limitations of conducting business and consumption were cast in patriotic terms, not only to combat the pandemic but to free up scarce resources for the war effort. Remove Ads Advertisement Public establishments were no less affected, especially schools and churches. Again, the record was mixed in regards to both the cooperation of local authorities and the effectiveness in combating the outbreak. Some clergy openly defied closure orders, while some congregations simply met in other places rather than their usual church buildings. Precautions Against Influenza G. L. Angeny (Public Domain) Recognized by doctors and other medical personnel as the only form of protection from the virus, masking ordinances were enacted in many places. Since the pandemic broke out during the war, public health campaigns encouraged people to wear a mask as a sign of their patriotic duty, but resistance to mask-wearing was high. Public Responses Public responses varied from place to place, largely at the state or city level. There was recognition that many of the responses would be costly in social, economic, and legal terms. People engaged in behaviors rooted in the idea that cleanliness would be an effective preventative against the illness. Face masks, disinfection, and frequent hand- and food washing were encouraged. There were attempts to sanitize public buildings and public transportation. Products in the cleanliness campaign included lime milk, soda lye, and steaming bedding and laundry. Cleaning and ventilating homes often was also advised. People were recommended to avoid crowds both indoors and outdoors, as those were one of the greatest risk factors in the spread of the illness. In some places, bans were enacted, although many people ignored the measures, which led to an increased number of ill people and deaths. People were also recommended to stay out of public spaces, especially if they were showing symptoms of the flu or were infected. Isolating individuals and families at home helped to combat the spread. US Public Health Pamphlet for 1918 Flu US Public Health Services (Public Domain) Other well-meaning advice to combat the flu included eating simple, well-cooked meals, not spitting on floors, and avoiding strong air drafts. Of course, there were also recommendations that not only proved futile but were, in fact, quite silly, such as camphor ball necklaces, gargling, fumigation, carbolic spray, eating onions, and assembling in large gatherings in order to spread the germ so people might develop natural immunity to the disease. Consequences The pandemic ended by late spring in 1919. By that time, nearly one-third of the world's population had been infected, and roughly 3% of the world's population died (50-100 million people). Those who suffered the most were in the 25-40-year-old demographic. The influenza pandemic produced lasting consequences, apart from the number of people who fell ill or died, affecting public health measures, medicine   especially the emerging fields of epidemiology and virology   economics, art & literature, etc. No segment of human society was unaffected. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! The pandemic produced a whole host of medical innovations. Doctors learned of the effectiveness of blood transfusions from survivors to the sick, which ushered in the era of blood typing to make the transfusions compatible. As scientists developed a better understanding of the virus, and disease in general, by the late 1920s/early 1930s, researchers, using the new electron microscope, developed techniques to view the virus. Simultaneously, scientists began growing the virus in chicken eggs, which allowed them to discover two types of influenza: A and B. By the late 1930s, British and American scientists began testing a new vaccine to combat influenza. In 1944, the vaccine was used on soldiers, and the following year witnessed the mass vaccination of civilians. Those early flu vaccines contained both types of viruses, which would result in the multi-virus vaccine in use today. The tools used to create these early flu vaccines were also used to develop vaccines for other infectious diseases. The research would enhance medical science's understanding of genes, leading to the cracking of the genetic code of human DNA in 1944. Letter Carrier in 1918 Flu Pandemic US War Department (Public Domain) Writers and artists during and in the post-WWI era reflected the suffering and death caused by the pandemic. Virginia Woolf's character, Clarissa Dalloway, in Mrs. Dalloway (1925), suffered from a heart condition caused by the flu. Anne Porter, author of Pale Horse, Pale Rider (1939), not only contracted the flu but her soldier-lover, who nursed her back to health, would die from the flu, which he contracted from her. T.S. Eliot, in 1922, wrote Wasteland, which described society in the aftermath of war and disease as a wounded land, both wasted and decapacitated. Ahmed Ali's Twilight in Delhi (1940) highlights the 1918 flu pandemic as a symbol of the ending of the old order, the economic disruption, and loss of memory that humans have for earlier pandemics, making them unprepared for the 1918 outbreak. Artists depicted the themes of trauma and despair while themselves suffering from the illness. Gustav Klimt (1862-1918) died from a stroke caused by the flu. Edvard Munch (1863-1944) and John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) contracted the disease but survived. Sargent had been sent to the front by the British government to sketch the joint actions of British & American troops. In the post-war period, various art monuments reflected the theme of hopelessness and ways in which people tried to cope with war & disease. Dadaism, the Bauhaus, and the abstract art movement engaged in new forms, created more practical and useful objects, or departed from reality to go beyond literal ideas and emotions. Lastly, in the realm of social sciences, the 1918 pandemic undermined the eugenic & social Darwinism movements. The disease struck everyone regardless of class, status, income, age, etc. The pandemic undermined the idea that there existed some group of 'superior' people in society. The flu undercut the notion that people were somehow responsible for catching diseases, either due to some character flaw or physical defect. No better example of this was the illness that struck the American president, Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), who became ill while attending the Paris Peace Conference to sign the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Wilson suffered from a fever, coughing fits, diarrhea, weakness, and confusion. Many writers have assumed that Wilson suffered a stroke while in Paris (a condition that struck him back in the United States while he tried to convince the US Congress and the American people to support the League of Nations), but in fact, Wilson caught the flu, shown by the symptoms he suffered from. The influenza pandemic swept the world, showing no favoritism toward any individuals, region, or nation, and became the deadliest pandemic of the 20th century.",

        "content": "Smasher of Napoleon's invasion dream, veteran of three major wars, and scene of the death of the Royal Navy's greatest hero, HMS Victory is one of Britain's most famous warships. Curiously, and despite being on permanent display as a tourist attraction, Victory remains to this day a fully commissioned naval vessel. This is her story. A First-Rate Warship HMS Victory was constructed from 1759 at Chatham Dockyards in Kent to a design by Sir Thomas Slade. Built of solid oak and elm, the ship required the sacrifice of an incredible 2,500 mature trees. Completed in May 1765, the three-masted ship was over 227 ft (69 m) long and displaced 3,500 long tons. It was the largest ship yet built for the navy, and she was fast. In the right conditions, Victory could cut through the water with remarkable speed for her size thanks to 36 sails and an innovative hull design. Remove Ads Advertisement HMS Victory by Pocock Nicholas Pocock (Public Domain) Victory was far from being a positive name for most of the sailors first assigned to her. This was because the last naval ship named Victory had sunk in 1744, with all hands drowned. This new Victory, actually the seventh British naval ship to carry that name, had a long wait to see active duty: 13 years, in fact. The first-rate warship carried a crew of over 800 and positively bristled with more than 100 guns set along three cramped decks. Victory was a major weapon for the British in the 1770s during the American Revolutionary War. The ship was then refitted and made the flagship of Vice-Admiral Lord Hood, who sailed her around the Mediterranean in the early 1790s during the French Revolutionary Wars. Victory sported a new hull covering of almost 4,000 copper plates. Victory's fortunes then went into decline as her condition deteriorated. Serving as a hospital ship in 1797, Victory was slated to see out her days as a prison hulk, the ultimate fall from grace. The venerable old warship then received a last-minute reprieve. After the loss of HMS Impregnable in 1799, and with war looming against the old enemy, France, the Admiralty was obliged to bring Victory back into service. Remove Ads Advertisement A Major Refit Extensively refitted, Victory sported a new hull covering of almost 4,000 copper plates and a whole new complement of lighter, more accurate, and faster-loading cannons. Most striking of all, the ship was painted a distinctive dark grey with yellow stripes. Victory was once again ready for war and her finest hour. The famed artist John Constable selected Victory as the subject of one of his paintings, describing the ship as \"the flower of the flock.\" Stern View, HMS Victory Library of Congress (Public Domain) From 1803, Britain and Napoleon's France were at war. The Napoleonic Wars involved a vast array of European nations, but it was a crucial naval battle in October 1805 that scuppered Napoleon's planned invasion of Britain and established the Royal Navy as the world's foremost naval fleet. This battle was Trafalgar. Remove Ads Advertisement The Battle of Trafalgar Victory was selected as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson, England's finest commander of the period and already a national hero. In the two-year build-up to the great Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson never left Victory once, sleeping each night in his bed of preference, a suspended cot positioned between two giant cannons. The British fleet met the slightly larger French and Spanish fleets off Cape Trafalgar (on the southern coast of Spain). It was from Victory that Nelson issued his immortal signal: \"England expects that every man will do his duty.\" The Royal Navy won the battle thanks to Nelson's innovative tactics, where, risking the full force of enemy fire as the respective fleets closed in, he smashed through the centre of the enemy's more traditional formation of two lines of ships. Another factor in the Royal Navy's favour was the ability of its experienced gunners to fire twice as fast as those of the enemy. Horatio Nelson Lemuel Francis Abbott (Public Domain) Victory's crew at Trafalgar included Britons, Indians, Africans, Americans, and even three Frenchmen. There was one woman, too, a Minorcan disguised as a man. The youngest crew member was not yet 12, and the eldest was well into his sixties. Some men were volunteers, others were conscripts, and some were convicts. All had one goal: survive the battle. Remove Ads Advertisement The venerable old warship survived Trafalgar but was badly battered. Victory was certainly no bystander to the battle and knocked out no less a ship than the French Admirals' flagship Bucentaure. With 104 guns, Victory was a formidable foe. Firing cannons accurately on a rolling sea was far from easy and required teamwork. A 32-pounder   of which Victory boasted 30   weighed three tons and needed a crew of 12 to 15 men to operate. Victory also had two massive 68-pounders on her decks; one of these had caused carnage when it fired a barrel of 500 musket balls right through the Bucentaure's stern windows. The British ship did not escape unscathed; her huge wheel was shattered by cannon fire, and it took a team of 40 men to rig an alternative steering mechanism in the heat of battle. Incredibly, no British ships were lost in the battle, but there was a heavy price to pay for victory. In the chaos of sail, smoke, and smashed timbers, a sniper on the French warship Redoubtable had fatally hit Nelson while he prowled Victory's quarterdeck. At least the stricken commander lived long enough to learn of his great victory. The venerable old warship survived Trafalgar but was badly battered, both in the battle itself and in the storm which immediately followed it. Victory, obliged to stop at Gibraltar for vital repairs, carried Nelson home preserved in a barrel of brandy. Aerial View, HMS Victory Geoff Parselle - MOD (Open Government License) Later Career Victory saw yet more active service as the Napoleonic Wars dragged on, particularly in the Baltic, and then operated as a troop ship from 1810. By the 1820s, the great ship was going nowhere and, dismasted and moored at Portsmouth, served as a stationary flagship of the naval command. Placed in dry dock in 1922 and then restored to its former glory, Victory was opened to public visits in 1928 in a ceremony presided over by King George V. The ship, 20% of which remains original, can still be toured today at Portsmouth's Historic Dock Yard. Victory's crucial role in Britain's defence is not forgotten; all naval vessels which pass her in Portsmouth fire a gun salute in her honour.",

        "title": "Battle of Ashdown: The First Major Defeat of the Great Heathen Army",
        "content": "The Battle of Ashdown, fought on 8th January 871 in southern England, saw the Kingdom of Wessex defeat the Great Heathen (Viking) Army. This was the first major defeat of the Viking army, which had arrived in England in 865 and had conquered several Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. While the conflict between the Wessex and the Vikings continued for several months into 871 and beyond, Ashdown demonstrated that the Viking army could be defeated, giving the English hope for future battles. Alfred the Great Statue, Shaftesbury Abbey Seth Whales (CC BY-SA) Wessex at the time was ruled by King Aethelred (reign 865-871), but his younger brother   and soon-to-be successor   Alfred the Great (reign 871-899), played a decisive role in the victory at Ashdown, proving himself a capable military commander and ensuring the West Saxon nobles backed his succession later in 871. Alfred spent most of his reign locked in a struggle with the Vikings, but secured his kingdom through victories at the Battles of Edington in 878 and the Battle of Buttington in 893. Remove Ads Advertisement Our knowledge of Ashdown relies heavily on The Life of King Alfred, a contemporary biography of the king written by his advisor and tutor, Bishop Asser. It presents a pro-Alfredian version of Ashdown, yet it nevertheless provides the most detailed contemporary account of a battle in 9th-century Britain, offering invaluable insights into Anglo-Saxon warfare. Vikings Raids England in the 8th century was divided into several kingdoms: East Anglia, Mercia (Midlands), Northumbria (northern England), and Wessex (southwest England). The rulers of these kingdoms competed for wealth, land and prestige, often fighting wars and occasionally allying with one another. It was this world of Anglo-Saxon game of Thrones that the Vikings entered into toward the end of the century. Initially, they began as small groups of Scandinavian pirates, sailing south in the hope of wealth and plunder. They first attacked Wessex in 789 and then Northumbria in 793, where they notoriously raided the prestigious monastery of Lindisfarne. With their great stores of wealth and limited defences, coastal monasteries and trading ports quickly became favoured targets for Viking raids in Britain. Remove Ads Advertisement The Vikings would not long remain content with mere plunder; they soon wanted to conquer & settle in England, too. Around the same time, the Kingdom of Wessex was growing in power, and upon conquering Mercia-ruled Kent in 829, it became the most dominant of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. While its early 9th-century kings, Egbert (reign 802-839) and Aethelwulf (reign 839-858), were effective military leaders and enjoyed several victories against the Vikings, these raids were becoming increasingly difficult to halt. Even their wealthiest towns soon became valid targets, and around the middle of the 9th century, Canterbury, London, Southampton and Winchester were looted by the Vikings. Using hit-and-run tactics, the Vikings could sail toward and plunder a coastal target, then return to their ships, before the English   who did not have standing armies   could summon numbers large enough to fight the raiders. They would, however, not long remain content with mere plunder; they soon wanted to conquer and settle in England, too. Remove Ads Advertisement The Great Army In 865, an alliance of sea-kings and raiders   known by contemporaries as \"the Great Army\"   gathered in the North Sea. According to the Norse sagas, its leaders, Ivar, Halfdan, and Ubbe, were brothers seeking revenge for their father, who had been killed by an English king. They were remembered by the English simply as \"valiant but cruel men.\" East Anglia   the smallest of the English kingdoms   was their first target. However, King Edmund of East Anglia (reign 855-869) offered tribute to the Norsemen in exchange for a peace treaty. The invaders were provided with horses, silver, food supplies and were allowed to winter in East Anglia. Great Viking Army in England, 865-878 CE Hel-hama (CC BY-SA) The following year, their new equestrian companions were put to use as they rode into Northumbria, conquering York, its wealthy capital. Two Northumbria kings led attacks to reclaim the town, but along with several northern ealdormen (earls), they were defeated and died at York. One shrewd Northumbrian ealdorman, Egbert, however, had stayed clear of battle and aligned himself with the invaders. In exchange, he was appointed to rule over the northern regions of Northumbria (historically known as Bernicia) on their behalf. Meanwhile, the Viking took direct control of York and its surrounding lands. In 868, they turned south, capturing Nottingham in northwest Mercia and fortifying themselves within. The Mercian ruler, King Burgred (reign 852-874), had long been an ally of the West Saxons and thus requested help from King Aethelred of Wessex. Together, they placed Nottingham under siege, but for the Anglo-Saxon commander, fortress warfare was an uncommon experience. They were unable to attack Nottingham's walls directly, nor could they maintain their armies long enough to starve Ivar into submission. Therefore, the Vikings accepted tribute payment from Burgred, delivered in gold and silver, in exchange for peace. Each payment, no doubt, emptied the coffers of its payees and attracted new recruits from Scandinavia, who heard tales of the prosperity enjoyed by their kinsmen and friends in England. Remove Ads Advertisement The following year, the Vikings returned to East Anglia, capturing Thetford, but no amount of tribute would save Edmund this time. His army was defeated, before he was tracked down and brought before Ivar. Edmund was offered to be the Vikings' vassal, like Egbert of Northumbria, and upon his refusal, he was tied to a tree before being stabbed with spears and beheaded. Burgred of Mercia might now have understood the hollowness and temporary nature of a peace treaty with the Vikings. The Death of St Edmund Abbo of Fleury (Public Domain) 871: A Year of Battles Ivar was seemingly content with his work so far. Establishing dominance of England's east coast and the great trading centre of York, he next took his followers north to fight the Strathclyde Britons. This left Halfdan as the senior leader of the army in East Anglia. Known by the West Saxons as \"the tyrant,\" Halfdan was a Danish ruler who left behind his kingdom to carve out a new one amongst the British Isles (Aethelweard, 41). With Northumbria crushed, Mercia taxed and King Edmund martyred, Halfdan decided Wessex would be next. In December 870, he marched southwest from East Anglia, taking Reading on Wessex's northern border. The town was ideally situated as an invasion headquarters. Sitting on the Thames, it allowed new soldiers and supplies to flow in and provided an easy escape route if things went wrong. With the town surrounded on two sides by the Thames and the River Kennet, Halfdan built ramparts around the rest of Reading, making it an impregnable fortress. Remove Ads Advertisement \"Ashdown\" is often a term used to describe the whole of the northern Berkshire Downs, rather than a specific place. Upon arrival, a raiding party was sent out to the Berkshire countryside in search of plunder, slaves and supplies. All the while, a local nobleman and veteran of Viking warfare, Ealdorman Aethelwulf of Berkshire, was rallying his troops. His army fell upon the raiders at Englefield (5 miles or 8 km west of Reading), cutting them down from their horses and slaying their leader. A minor battle it might have been, but the first victory had gone to Wessex. To the south, more support awaited as King Aethelred was raising a large army to help Ealdorman Aethelwulf. As Aethelred and Aethelwulf came to the fortress, they slaughtered several unprepared Viking soldiers found outside its walls. Yet, taking the fortress was altogether a different task. The two leaders, Aethelred and Halfdan, had already met previously, during the siege of Nottingham in 868, when the Vikings were content to play the waiting game, before being paid to leave. Halfdan, however, would not repeat this strategy. He surprised his opponent and immediately confronted the West Saxons. As Asser explains: Like wolves, they burst out of all the gates and joined battle with all their might. Both sides fought there for a long time, and fought fiercely, but alas, the Christians eventually turned their backs, and the Vikings won the victory and were masters of the battlefield. (Keynes and Lapidge, 78) Amongst the dead outside Reading was Wessex's most celebrated war chief, Ealdorman Aethelwulf, a great blow to the king's campaign. Aethelred's army retreated westward, perhaps linking up with fresh soldiers arriving from Wiltshire and Somerset. Halfdan now felt he had the perfect opportunity to finish off Wessex for good. His experience in East Anglia and Northumbria taught him that the capture of a key town, followed by military victory and the king's death, led to the kingdom's surrender. So, he followed Aethelred west, hoping to inflict a second and fatal defeat upon him. Battle of Ashdown On 8th January 871, on a cold winter morning, the armies of Aethelred and Halfdan caught sight of one another amongst the northern Berkshire hills. However, where they stood is uncertain. \"Ashdown\" is often a term used to describe the whole of the northern Berkshire Downs, rather than a specific place. Yet most scholars suggest the battle likely took place among the hills west of the village of Moulsford, on the Oxfordshire-Berkshire border. We also know nothing of either army's size. While the West Saxons would have lost many outside the gates of Reading, fresh recruits from the west after the battle likely brought them back to a size similar to the Viking army, which had left behind a garrison to guard Reading. The army of Wessex was formed from a core of professional warriors serving in the household of the king and ealdormen, along with those of lesser status who owed military service to and were led by local landowning warriors (thegns). The soldiers on both sides were mostly armed with shields and spears, with axes more prevalent among the Vikings, and the elite West Saxon warriors bearing swords an expensive, rare weapon often passed down through generations. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! The Vikings had arrived first at the battlefield, taking the higher ground at Ashdown. As the two sides looked across from one another, Halfdan gave his first order. His army was to be divided into two, half led by him and his ally, King Bagsec, and the other half by several earls. As they spread out across the upper grounds of the Berkshire hills, Halfdan gave a second order, and his army duly formed a \"shield wall\"   a long front line of soldiers locking their shields together to guard against an incoming attack. Seeing this, Aethelred followed suit, splitting his army into two shield walls, with himself commanding one to oppose Halfdan and Bagsec, and his younger brother, Prince Alfred, commanding the other to face the Viking earls. However, before any fighting could begin, Aethelred returned to his tent for a pre-battle mass, praying for divine help. Some form of prayers or mass was not unusual before battle. The English were, after all, convinced that the Vikings had been sent to punish them for their sins. Holding himself responsible for the souls of his subjects, Aethelred was fighting both a physical and a spiritual war. Halfdan, however, had no interest in respecting Christian pre-battle rituals. He seized this moment of vulnerability to strike first. Abandoning the high ground, he and the Viking earls marched on Alfred, hoping to crush his army with their superior numbers. When Aethelred was informed, he declared he \"would not leave that place [the tent] alive before the priest had finished mass and that he would not forsake divine service for that of men\" (Keynes and Lapidge 79). Alfred would now have to take on both Halfdan and the Viking earls alone. \"With loud shouting from all,\" and Alfred \"acting courageously, like a wild boar,\" as Asser tells us, he strode forth to meet the Vikings (Keynes and Lapidge, 79). Artist's Impression of Alfred the Great The Creative Assembly (Copyright) The clash between the two armies sounded with a mighty \"thud\" as the walls of wooden shields smashed together. A shield wall versus shield wall clash often sank into a slow-moving shoving match. With little innovative strategy or creativity, in this battle of strength, power and determination, each side would seek to push the other back and break through their wall. Meanwhile, frontline warriors poked, jabbed, prodded and stabbed their spears at gaps in the wall, hoping to deliver lethal blows to their opposite number. Such a slow-moving contest suited Alfred; being vastly outnumbered, he could only hope to hold off the Vikings long enough for Aethelred to come to his rescue. Remove Ads Advertisement Eventually, Aethelred arrived, leading his troops in an ambush of the Vikings. Some scholars have even suggested that his delayed entry was a tactical move, rather than a religious one. Perhaps striking the Vikings' flank or rear, he relieved pressure on his brother and gained the upper hand over the invaders. The fight continued for several more hours, yet as the waning Viking army was attacked on two fronts, their shield wall crumbled and collapsed. The West Saxons surged through the breaches, hewing down their foes in great numbers. A 10th-century chronicler, Ealdorman Aethelweard, remarked, \"neither before nor after has such a slaughter been heard of.\" Asser recorded: Bagseg was killed, and Earl Sidroc the Old, Earl Sidroc the Younger, Earl Osbem, Earl Fraena, and Earl Harold . ... the entire Viking army was put to flight, right on till nightfall and into the following day, until such time as they reached the stronghold [Reading] from which they had come. The Christians followed them till nightfall, cutting them down on all sides. (Keynes and Lapidge, 80) Aftermath Halfdan's plans of a quick victory had been shattered. Just over a week into the war, a large chunk of his army and several of his leading allies had died. Wessex was not, after all, so weak as Northumbria or East Anglia. However, given his experience at Reading just a few days before, Aethelred would not assault the town again. It appeared that the conflict would be a stalemate. The Vikings were unable to conquer Wessex, and the West Saxons were unable to expel the Vikings. However, with the death of several allied Viking leaders   and potential rivals for command   Halfdan now commanded greater authority over the army. Perhaps to secure his complete leadership over this admittedly smaller force and replenish supplies, only two weeks after Ashdown, he led another raid into Wessex. His target was Basing, 15 miles (24 km) south of Reading. Outside the town, he was once again met by King Aethelred's army, but this time he defeated the West Saxons and took control of Basing. The conflict now reached an informal ceasefire, with two months of peace. The campaign was reignited in March, when the Vikings raided deep into Hampshire, where they defeated Aethelred at the Battle of Merton. Following the battle, a second Viking fleet (known as \"the great summer army\") sailed from the continent to Reading to assist Halfdan. Worse, during the battle at Merton, Aethelred had been fatally wounded. He only lived a few more weeks before dying in April 871. In accordance with arrangements made earlier that year, Alfred succeeded to the throne, ahead of his brother's infant sons, Aethelwold and Aethelhelm, who were not yet old enough to rule. Although he frequently suffered from a mysterious and severe illness, Alfred was 22 years old and had already proven his bravery during the battles at Reading, Ashdown, Basing and Merton. Swanborough Tump Memorial, Wiltshire Bikeboy (CC BY-SA) However, his reign began with a series of military disasters. While he was overseeing his brother's funeral and burial at Wimborne Minster, the army of Berkshire was defeated by the great summer army at Reading. Nearer to home, in May 871, Alfred himself was defeated in battle by Halfdan near Wilton, Wiltshire. This had dashed any hope Alfred had of a military solution. The only way the Vikings would now leave was by paying them. The payment (or \"danegeld\") would no doubt empty his coffers and make him unpopular with his new and now heavily taxed subjects. Remove Ads Advertisement While Halfdan had enjoyed a string of victories, he had not won a decisive enough victory to discredit support for Alfred. Nor had he intended to lead such a long campaign; thus, as his army grew smaller with each battle and supplies became ever more meagre, he accepted being paid to leave Wessex, retreating to London in the autumn of 871. As the year ended, Alfred could take solace in the fact that he kept his crown and kingdom, a fate better than Edmund of East Anglia or the Northumbrian kings. Legacy 871 had been a year of great significance for the Viking invasion. Significant death tolls were suffered by both sides, including several of the leaders involved. Wessex had, however, shown it was capable of defeating the Great Heathen Army in battle, something that no other kingdom had achieved so far. The war between the English and the Vikings would continue. Halfdan attacked Mercia in 874, forcing King Burgred into exile on the continent. He would subsequently shift his focus to Northumbria and Ireland, leaving the leader of the great summer army, Guthrum, to take up the fight against Alfred in the south. When Guthrum invaded Wessex in 878, he chased Alfred into the Somerset marshes, almost conquering the entire kingdom. Only several months later, when Alfred regathered the West Saxons, was he able to raise a large enough army to defeat Guthrum at the Battle of Edington. Alfred the Great Statue, Winchester Odejea (CC BY-NC-SA) Guthrum and Alfred soon agreed to a more lasting peace treaty, with the Viking leader converting to Christianity and southern England being divided between them, as the declining Mercian kingdom was carved into an English west and a Norse east. As Christian brothers, they endeavoured to uphold an imperfect peace between both sides until Guthrum died in 890. However, the next generation would continue the fight for supremacy, with Alfred's heirs   Edward the Elder (his son) and Aethelstan (his grandson)   extending West Saxon control over the rest of England.",

        "title": "Lend-Lease: The WWII US Aid Programme for Allies",
        "content": "Lend-Lease Machine Guns Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Lend-Lease (sometimes called Lease-Lend) was a programme of financial and material aid given by the United States to its allies during the Second World War (1939-45). Food, weapons, ammunition, and agricultural equipment were amongst the goods which crossed the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The value of Lend-Lease goods has been estimated at around $50 billion. Payment was expected from the recipient states, although there was flexibility on how much, in what form, and when this was to be given. Lend-Lease was a massive operation, which ensured the US minimised its own military casualties while still using its tremendous economic power to drive the Allied cause. The programme became one of the great logistical achievements of the war effort, immeasurably helping the Allies win WWII. Helping the Allies At the outset of the Second World War, the United States, wary of becoming embroiled in a conflict on another continent, remained officially neutral and so could not directly intervene militarily. Giving material aid to participants in a war had been prohibited by the mid-1930s Neutrality Acts. Even loans were restricted by the Johnson Debt-Default Act, which excluded those nations that had not paid back the money lent during the First World War (1914-18). This was a heavy restriction because the only country which had paid off all of its debts to the US was Finland. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was determined to break down the traditional US foreign policy of isolationism any way he could within the law, and so he summoned Congress to repeal parts of the legislation blocking aid for the Allies. First, France and Britain were permitted to purchase arms (provided they paid cash and transported the arms themselves), and then another Congressional decision allowed US merchant ships to enter war zones and carry arms and ammunition as cargo. There was now a way to legally send much-needed assistance to Europe and elsewhere, yet for the United States to remain neutral. Remove Ads Advertisement In total, over 38 countries received aid from the USA during the war. Roosevelt, faced with direct appeals for aid from figures like British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was even willing to bend the law a little. For example, the US President ensured British warships were repaired in US ports, and he sent warplanes to the USA's Canadian border, which allowed the Canadians to literally haul the planes into their own territory and then send them on to Europe. Another case involved an exchange of US destroyer warships for bases. Under this deal, the US promised to provide Britain with 50 destroyers (they received only 9 by the end of 1940), and in return, it acquired 99-year leases for several naval bases in the West Indies, Bermuda, Newfoundland, and British Guiana. Battle of the Atlantic, 1943 Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Roosevelt finally gained more freedom of action following the widespread outrage at the German U-boat attack on the US destroyer Kearny in October 1941 and the consequent repeal of many more restrictive neutrality laws. The US then went into full swing in its efforts to give aid to those defending freedom. Remove Ads Advertisement The Lend-Lease programme was designed, then, to give material and financial aid to those Allied nations which were fighting the three common enemies of the free world: Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan. As the name suggests, the programme did not give goods for free; recipients were expected to repay the costs, but there was flexibility in terms of both the amount and timing of the repayments. Beneficiaries of the Lend-Lease programme included Great Britain, the USSR, China, South Africa, Egypt, Australia, and New Zealand. In total, over 38 countries received aid from the USA during the war. The Issue of Payment As noted above, the US preferred cash for the goods sent via Lend-Lease. This soon became problematic since countries like Britain, not only suffering from the war but also from the consequent collapse in world trade, were running very low on cash reserves. With France's surrender in June 1940, Britain was left alone in Europe to face an aggressively rampant Germany and Italy. Britain could call on assistance from colonies like India and Australia, but the fact was that the size of the British Empire meant Britain was struggling both militarily and financially to protect its assets in South Asia, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. On top of that, Adolf Hitler seemed determined to launch a German invasion of the British Isles. Remove Ads Advertisement Many in the US could not believe the government that presided over the vast British Empire was strapped for cash, but that was the reality, and Churchill even offered to show the nation's accounting books to Roosevelt to prove it. The British ambassador to the US starkly stated: \"Britain's broke\" (Dear, 531). There was a gradual realisation amongst many Americans that Britain was, in effect, fighting a war so that the US could remain on the sidelines militarily. An analogy came into common circulation of the moral and practical benefits of loaning one's fire hose to a neighbour when their house was on fire. If Britain collapsed under the pressure, then there would be nothing to stop the authoritarian aggressors of WWII from turning their sights on North America and setting houses ablaze there, too. On the other hand, giving aid carried risks. US material aid to Britain was regarded by the aggressor nations as no different from being fully involved in the war. It did seem that continuing and even increasing aid would eventually lead to the US becoming militarily embroiled in WWII. Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1944 Leon Perskie (CC BY) Roosevelt did hold out hope that if enough aid were given, then US troops would not be needed in the conflict and US military casualties would be avoided. From December 1940, this attitude and that of the fire analogy meant Roosevelt was prepared to give material to the USA's democratic allies and not insist on particular conditions or exact figures of repayment. To continue the fire hose analogy, Roosevelt argued to Congress that if one's neighbour did manage to put out their fire but damaged the hose in the process, then compensation could be made not in terms of the precise cost of the hose but by an informal agreement that its value would be repaid in kind. A bill was passed by Congress in March 1941, and the US became the 'Arsenal of Democracy' as Roosevelt put it. Repayment terms were to be agreed according to what \"the President deems satisfactory\" (the wording of the legislation, quoted in Dear, 531), judging on a case-by-case basis. It should also be noted that many countries sent raw materials to the US, which were used to produce the manufactured goods they most needed. The US industries providing Lend-Lease goods positively boomed. Increasingly, as the war went on, payment was expected not in cash or goods but in concessions favourable to long-term US foreign policy and trade, such as opening up of closed markets and removing any restrictions previously applied to the US. There also remained some sticky issues, such as those who opposed giving aid to the communist USSR (which had become Adolf Hitler's principal enemy from the summer of 1941) and whether or not the US Navy should provide warships to defend the convoys carrying material aid to Europe and elsewhere. Remove Ads Advertisement Types of Materials Sent The Lend-Lease materials sent by ship and air were very varied indeed, ranging from eggs to tanks. Although all payment for goods required the approval of Congress, the only restriction made by President Roosevelt on what could be included in the Lend-Lease programme was that the goods were needed \"in the interest of national defence\" (legislation text, quoted in Dear, 531). There were, otherwise, no legal restrictions on what could be sent to Allied nations. From August 1941, the general production and supervision of goods was the responsibility of a new organisation, the Office of Lend-Lease Administration (OLLA). Lend-Lease Agricultural Equipment Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) A major component was food for Britain, where people endured a strict system of rationing. Britain not only received US-produced food like cheese and meat but also agricultural equipment, which could improve homegrown production rates on British farms. Another major success was the delivery of tens of thousands of trucks to the USSR's Red Army, effectively making this a truly mobile force for the first time. US-built tanks helped boost the Allied cause in the North Africa Campaign. Small- and large-calibre munitions were vital to keep guns firing in all theatres of the war. Engines and spare parts ensured machines of war of all kinds could continue to operate. The US industries providing Lend-Lease goods positively boomed. US war production was ramped up, and the huge logistical network required to transport the goods was quickly and efficiently developed. Most goods were delivered to Britain by merchant ships operating in convoys for greater safety. Goods not destined for Britain were then shipped on to places like Murmansk and the Persian Gulf. Lend-Lease production also had to face competition from the demands of the US military once the United States became fully involved in the war following the attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941. There was certainly a shortage of merchant ships in 1942, but production of these caught up with demand by 1943. Ultimately, Lend-Lease bases were established around the world from Australia to Chile to Morocco to China. Many such bases benefited from an expansion of local rail and road networks. Some aircraft were flown to their destination, often by civilian pilots, including women. Remove Ads Advertisement The Lend-Lease programme was hugely successful in getting material to where it was most needed. The total cost of goods sent can only be estimated because of the sheer scale of the project, but The Oxford Companion to World War II states, \"between $42 and $50 billion of aid-food, military goods, oil, industrial production, and services went to America's wartime allies\" (532). Britain received more than anyone else, around half of those goods, while the USSR received around one-fifth. Lend-Lease Cheese Shipment Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The End of Lend-Lease The Lend-Lease programme continued to split US politics as the war went on. A Senate decision to continue the programme in the spring of 1945 only won against those senators who wished to end it by a single vote. There were claims (sometimes true) that states were welcoming goods under Lend-Lease but then exporting them elsewhere for profit. Some in the United States called for a reduction of aid to Britain, the argument being that state was surely capable now of standing alone and was only using US aid to strengthen its own future position in the post-war world. This was not true since, having been forced to give up assets to the US, Britain was particularly affected by the long-term repercussions of Lend-Lease, as the historian S. Ambrose explains: The Americans insisted that the British sell their overseas assets; this meant that at the end of the war the income that the British counted on and depended on for so long from her overseas investments was no longer there. They had been sold at American insistence The Americans then moved into the areas that had previously been British colonies, whether simple or economic colonies. So Britain was in a much weaker position at the end of the war than she had been at the beginning and was not in a position to recover. (Holmes, 129) There had been (albeit vague) promises back in 1944 that Lend-Lease would continue after the war to help the much-needed and extremely costly task of rebuilding war-ravaged countries. Nevertheless, President Harry S. Truman, who took office in April 1945, immediately cancelled Lend-Lease following the Japanese surrender in August. Many governments felt let down by this decision, and Truman later admitted the programme should have continued for longer, although some states did receive substantial long-term loans, such as the $650 million lent to France in 1945. The question of repayments remained contentious. The USSR, for example, baulked at US demands to pay back an outstanding $2.6 billion. In fact, an agreement on the repayment terms was not reached until 1990. Lend-Lease did leave a more meaningful legacy in the longer term. The United States and other nations came to regard aid-giving as a necessary and mutually beneficial branch of foreign policy, an attitude that continues to hold favour today with many governments around the world.",

        "title": "Chinampas: Mexico's Human-Made Agricultural Islands",
        "content": "Modern Chinampa Farming Emmanuel Eslava (CC BY-SA) Chinampas are human-made islands built in shallow lakebeds that have fed the people of Mesoamerica and shaped local ecosystems for over a thousand years. Sometimes referred to as 'floating gardens,' these agricultural feats of engineering survive as a testament to the ingenuity of the Aztec civilization and their lake-dwelling predecessors, particularly the ancient peoples of Xochimilco, where chinampas are still in use today. Building a Chinampa With the posts in place to establish the structure of the artificial island, laborers wove reeds, vines, & branches between them to create the enclosure. The word chinampa derives from the Nahuatl term chinamitl, meaning \"a fence made of plants\" or that which could be enclosed within a fence of plants. The labor-intensive process of building a chinampa began with locating a firm floor in the shallow area of a lake. There, laborers would drive wooden posts into the lake bottom. The designated area for the construction was usually rectangular, with lengths varying from 8 to 100 meters and widths ranging between 2 and 25 meters. Along with the posts, laborers planted willow trees, such as Mexico's native bonpland willows (Salix bonplandiana), in the corners or along the perimeter, where the roots of the trees would give structure to the nascent chinampa. The Florentine Codex depicts a willow tree growing out of blue waves; its simple, lance-shaped leaves that alternate along the stem are characteristic of the water-loving Salix genus. Remove Ads Advertisement With the posts in place to establish the structure of the artificial island, laborers wove reeds, vines, and branches between them to create the enclosure from which the chinampa derives its name. Once the fence of plants was completed, laborers began the arduous task of filling the enclosure with many layers of soil, at least some of which would have been scraped from the bottom of the lake itself, thus fortifying the fence with mud and further plant material. Once the chinamitl was stable and the raised mud and soil reached a height of 50 cm above the surface of the water, the top layer of soil was left to dry for several weeks before the land was used for planting. Huexotl Willow Tree Unknown Artist (CC BY-NC-ND) To control floodwaters and promote moisture content in the soil, laborers constructed sophisticated drainage systems including dams, sluice gates, ditches, dikes, and canals. Flowing between chinampa fields, the canals served as waterways and allowed those who worked the land to transport supplies, crops, and fertilizer directly to and from the artificial fields in the lake shallows. Capillary action drew water into the layers of soil in the chinampa, allowing adjacent canals to serve as reservoirs for an integrated subirrigation system that met the water needs of the crops and created a microenvironment that protected them from frost. In addition to the aquatic infrastructure required to sustain the chinampas, water reservoirs and fish weirs   fences placed in flowing water to direct the motion of fish   could also be constructed to set aside water for different tasks and to expedite fishing. Remove Ads Advertisement Fertilization & Maintenance In order to ensure the ongoing fertility of these human-made agricultural islands, farmers, known as chinamperos, employed a number of fertilization methods. One of these methods involved transferring mud, soil, sediment, and vegetation from the bottom of the canals to the top layer of the artificial fields. This process helped to maintain the canals while also renewing the topsoil of the chinampas for better planting. The soil from the canals contained a high build-up of organic material from decomposing plant matter, animal waste, and other waterborne debris, which facilitated water retention and kept crops from losing too much moisture during the dry season. This allowed for year-round cultivation, made efficient through the use of seedbeds to prepare new crops for planting even while others were being harvested. Adding fresh topsoil from the canals also helped to aerate the chinampas and promoted long-term fertility and high productivity. Other methods of fertilization included applying compost (including food waste, ash, charcoal, and excrement) and other organic materials. Using crop residue as mulch also helped to suppress the growth of weeds. With careful maintenance, chinampas in the time of the Aztecs could host a huge array of crops and flowers. Today's chinamperos, keeping alive the agricultural tradition, cultivate crops including maize, legumes (bush beans and fava beans), amaranth, tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, radish, seepweed, purslane, and many more. While the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica would not have had access to nearly as many domesticated animals, most of which are not native to the Americas, modern chinamperos often keep animals like chickens, cattle, swine, and sheep, feeding them on excess produce and adding their manure to the fertilization process. Remove Ads Advertisement Canals of Xochimilco Luis Bartolom  Marcos (CC BY-SA) Benefits of Chinampa Design for Agriculture & Ecosystem After hundreds of years, the chinampas still make it possible to grow crops in a lacustrine environment and promote the health of the local ecosystem. Within the chinampas themselves, the native willows planted at the perimeter of the fences serve as more than structural support. Fast growing and anchored by dense root systems that help prevent soil erosion, broad crowns of willow branches and leaves provide shade and create barriers against wind and pests. As the trees grow taller, they also provide a natural trellis on which vine crops can climb to facilitate better access to sunlight. The microecosystem of the chinampas supports biodiversity & plays host to beneficial bacterial & fungal species. The microecosystem of the chinampas also supports biodiversity and plays host to beneficial bacterial and fungal species. Because so much of the layered soil in the chinampas comes from the lakebed, algae, bacteria, and macrophytes proliferate in the soil. These organisms consume and convert the nutrients from decaying organic matter, storing excess nitrogen and phosphorus as a survival mechanism for use in nutrient-deficient conditions. Through this process, these bacteria increase the nitrogen reserves of the soil. When new soil is added to the surface, it introduces more organic matter and moisture, feeding the algae, bacteria, and macrophytes and propagating the nitrogen-fixing cycle. As an example of raised farming, chinampas are similar to structures from other parts of the Americas, including the raised gardens of Lake Titicaca, and other raised farming techniques have been recorded in regions including the Netherlands, Denmark, Russia, France, and Bangladesh. In all of these cases, raised farming techniques promote soil quality, aeration, and moisture content through drainage, and in some cases, like Mexico's chinampas, this technique enables agricultural production in environments where it would otherwise be impossible. While this was not an innovation of Aztec agriculture, it was perfected under the sway of their empire such that, in the 15th and 16th centuries, the chinampas of Mesoamerica fed hundreds of thousands of people. Remove Ads Advertisement Chinampas of Tenochtitlan, Lake Texcoco & Xochimilco When the Mexica (pronounced \"Me-SHEE-kuh\") people came to the Valley of Mexico, they found a land already dominated by other cultural and ethnic groups, and they depended on mercenary work to sustain themselves. After years of wandering in search of political security, the Mexica resolved to build their home on Lake Texcoco, taking a location that no one else wanted and transforming it into the heart of an empire. The Aztec civilization that rose from those swampy waters was so enduring that the symbol of the city's god-given founding portent   an eagle seated on a cactus eating a snake   remains the central element on the flag of Mexico today. Map of the Aztec Empire, c. 1427 1521 Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-ND) Part of the reason that no other people had settled the region around Lake Texcoco was that Mesoamericans depended almost wholly on agriculture for sustenance. Supplemented by game animals and a very select few domesticated species, Mesoamerican peoples primarily ate fruits and vegetables and thus required a great deal of agricultural infrastructure. With little arable land around Lake Texcoco, chinampas emerged as an elegant and effective solution to the problem of food. The early Aztecs were most likely inspired by their rivals in Xochimilco, which means \"flowering fields\" in Nahuatl, where chinampas were already flourishing before the founding of Tenochtitlan. Resolved to thrive in their newfound home, the people of Lake Texcoco set about filling the shallow waters with farmland. The Florentine Codex describes a type of land called atlalli, which is a combination of atl, meaning \"water,\" and tlalli, meaning \"earth,\" in Nahuatl. In describing what makes this land unique from other forms of tlalli, the Nahuatl author tells us, \"This is the irrigated field. It is a watered garden, one which can be irrigated it is good, fine, precious; a source of food, esteemed; a place of fertility to be planted to maize, to be planted to beans, to be harvested\" (Book 11, folio 227v - 228r, translated by Anderson & Dibble). The image below shows a farmer at work, standing between tendrils and pools of water. The artist signifies the fertility of the land not only through the contrast of textures between the curling water and the tufted earth but also by the presence of stems and flowers, particularly some that resemble corn plants, near the end of the branches of moisture. Remove Ads Advertisement Atlalli Aztec Irrigation The Florentine Codex (CC BY-NC-ND) Over the course of the nearly two centuries of Aztec rule, chinamperos tended to the artificial island farms, and the government controlled and regulated all aspects of maintenance with an emphasis on economizing the use of time, produce, and waste. In fact, the fertilization of the chinampas was integrated into the lavatory practices of the people of the city. Inhabitants of Tenochtitlan relieved themselves in specialized huts built near city streets and alleys, where canoes would collect the human excrement. From there, it was transported directly to the chinampas, where it would be used as fertilizer along with plant matter and other nutrient-rich organic material. In addition to the fertilization methods mentioned above, Aztec chinamperos left their farm-islands fallow after two or three years of use to allow the soil to rest before further cultivation. Through this carefully organized system, Aztec-era chinampas could support seven different crops in their year-round cycle. Crop productivity was maximized by allowing seeds to germinate in seedbeds before being introduced to the chinampas. While other crops grew in the full-sized plots, farmers planted seeds in small squares of soil called chap nes, where they grew for a few weeks before being transplanted into the chinampa soil, fertilized, and gently covered with a layer of native straw and reeds. This layer of vegetation would protect the new seedlings from the sun and help trap the humidity in the soil. Finally, the crops were sprayed with a solution of ground chiles and water to control pests. Once fully grown, the crops were harvested, loaded directly into boats, and sent to the bustling markets that surrounded Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs, like many Indigenous American populations, employed, among other plants, a sort of sacred trinity of food crops: corn, beans, and squash. Sometimes known to Indigenous populations as \"The Three Sisters,\" these species thrive when planted together in a shared space because each of the crops provides some form of support for the others. Corn plants provide a natural trellis on which bean plants climb to thrive, and bean plants absorb nitrogen from the air, which they convert to nitrates that help fertilize the surrounding soil. Squash leaves provide ground cover that inhibits soil evaporation and the growth of weeds, ensuring their neighbors' access to moist, nutrient-rich soil. While the Aztecs would not have used the title \"The Three Sisters\" to describe their intercropping techniques, corn, beans, and squash were nonetheless staples of the Aztec diet, and the chinampa farming zones on Lake Xochimilco produced enough crops to feed approximately 100,000 people during the height of the Aztec empire. The Florentine Codex preserves an image of corn described as cintli: \"the white maize ear that of the irrigated lands, that of the fields, that of the chinampas.\" (Book 11, folio 246v, translated by Anderson & Dibble) Cintli Maize Plant Unknown Artist (CC BY-NC-ND) In addition to the crops needed to sustain Tenochtitlan's population, Aztec chinamperos often planted flowers in their floating island plots. Far from simply being a source of beauty, flowers were symbolically important throughout Mesoamerican cultures. Known as xochitl (\"SHOW-cheet\") in Nahuatl, flowers were also offerings in Aztec sacrifice rituals. Three deities who had particularly associations with them, Xochipilli, Xochiquetzal, and Macuilxochitl, were worshipped as patrons of the arts, beauty, and pleasure. Xochitl in cuicatl, meaning \"flowers and song,\" was a metaphorical turn of phrase in Nahuatl that could be used to refer to all manner of artistic endeavors, particularly the deeply valued Aztec art of poetry. Whether worn by dancing women during celebrations, carried to signify the presence of a god on earth, or offered to honor the gods on sacred days, the flowers of Tenochtitlan grew on chinampas. Chinampas Today Recent surveys show that chinampas were in use in Mesoamerica as early as 1000 BCE, and though most of the great lakes that once housed the heart of Aztec civilization were drained long ago, a few chinampas still feed the people of Mexico City after hundreds of years. While there are about 5,000 acres of extant chinampas, only about 2.5 percent of those are still used for agriculture, and the chinamperos that farm them employ both traditional and modern techniques.

Named in Nahuatl, like the irrigated land itself, after atl (\"water\") and the Aztec god Xolotl, axolotls are critically endangered amphibians whose unique regenerative capabilities   they can regrow limbs, eyes, and portions of their brains   make them an active subject of medical research. They were well known to the Aztecs and seem to have thrived in the basin of Mexico before the conquest, despite being a particularly esteemed part of the Aztec diet, described in the Florentine Codex as \"a meal fit for lords.\" (Book 11, folio 68r, translated by Anderson & Dibble). Axolotl Unknown Artist (CC BY-NC-ND) Today, scientists estimate that there are about 50 to 1,000 individuals left in the wild, and the combination of urban expansion and the decline of the cultivation of chinampas for agriculture has drastically reduced their habitat. The infrastructure of the floating farms, particularly the small canals that branch from larger waterways, provide axolotls with refuge from the invasive carp and tilapia, introduced to the ecosystem in the 1960s, that compete with them for food resources and prey on their young. The ecosystemic relationship between these unique amphibians and Mexico's farm-islands is enshrined on the 2021 50 peso note, which depicts an axolotl suspended in rippling canal waters, surrounded by crop-filled chinampas, and fenced in by the willows and reeds that form the salamander's natural habitat. In the background, a corn plant rendered in ethereal gold rises like the sun, and the text commemorates the environment of Xochimilco in its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Invaluable to the axolotls, modern chinampas also benefit local human populations by providing ecosystemic services, including water filtration, microclimate regulation, increased agro- and biodiversity, regulation of water levels, and the capture and sequestration of greenhouse gases. But the mere presence of chinampas cannot provide these services without care and maintenance. A number of agencies and organizations are actively pursuing conservation efforts to preserve and revitalize the chinampas of the basin of Mexico, but the trends are not promising. Even with ambitious local initiatives, the outlook is alarming. A projection for the year 2057 assumes that in Xochimilco, without a concerted effort from the involved players (particularly farmers and local government), most current chinampa land will be converted to housing. (Ebel 2019) Now, as in the time of the Aztecs, caring for and cultivating chinampas is a labor-intensive process. Today, a few people safeguard centuries-old farming techniques, and relatively few strive to sustain the whole system of chinampa agriculture from what would seem to be its inevitable decay. In 2022, researchers estimated that 90 percent of chinampas in Xochimilco and the surrounding area had been abandoned, and while the pandemic stoked some interest in the efforts to revitalize chinampas and further support chinamperos, Alejandra Borunda, writing for National Geographic magazine, noted that chinampas represent \"1,000 years of history, still alive for now.\" (Borunda 2022).",

        "title": "Potsdam Conference: When the WWII Allies Declared Japan Must Surrender",
        "content": "Attlee, Truman & Stalin, Potsdam, 1945 Unknown Photographer (Public Domain) The Potsdam Conference, held from 17 July to 2 August 1945 in Potsdam in eastern Germany, decided how the Allies would deal with a defeated Germany and how they could best conduct the ongoing campaign against Japan as the Second World War (1939-45) drew to a close. With victory in Europe achieved, US President Harry S. Truman, UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and then his successor, Clement Attlee, and the Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin issued a surrender ultimatum to Japan, known as the Potsdam Declaration. The ultimatum was ignored until US aircraft dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan surrendered on 14 August. Agreement at Yalta In February 1945, as victory seemed imminent for the Allies in the Second World War, the leaders of 'the Big Three' met at Yalta in the Crimea: President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and the Russian Premier Joseph Stalin. On the discussion table were such topics as how to deal with a defeated Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, and how to set up the United Nations, successor to the League of Nations. Poland's borders were to be shifted westwards, giving the USSR the eastern slice while acquiring a new western slice from Germany. It was agreed in principle to allow democratic elections in countries Nazi Germany had occupied. This sentiment was expressed in the Declaration on Liberated Europe. Remove Ads Advertisement Germany and Austria, in contrast, were to be divided into four zones of occupation (US, French, British, and Russian) with a joint military government established in each, the Allied Control Council in Germany and the Inter-Allied Council in Austria. Berlin and Vienna were similarly divided into zones of control. In addition, it was decided that each power had the right to conduct war crimes trials within its zone of occupation. Including France as an occupying power of Germany and Austria was a Western 'victory' at Yalta, as was the decision to allow France a permanent seat on the UN's governing Security Council. Another major agreement at Yalta concerned the still ongoing fighting with Japan. In return for Russia's entering the war against Japan, certain Soviet demands would be met. These demands included control of the Kuril (aka Kurile) Islands, the southern part of Sakhalin Island (both of these are in the Sea of Okhotsk and had been occupied by Japan), and retaining the status quo regarding Mongolia, which had been a Russian client state since 1924. There were many issues still unresolved, and so the 'Big Three' planned to meet again in July, this time at Potsdam, in Germany, an area then under Soviet military control. Remove Ads Advertisement Churchill, Roosevelt, & Stalin in Yalta, 1945 Imperial War Musuems (CC BY-NC-SA) Potsdam & New Faces The Potsdam Conference was held at Schloss Cecilienhof, not an imposing castle but more of a comfortable mansion set in a grand park outside Berlin. The meeting at Potsdam was given the code name Terminal. As at Yalta, the leaders of Great Britain, the USA, and the USSR still considered themselves the legitimate decision-makers for the fate of other nations largely because of the size of the armies they commanded and their successes on the battlefield, at sea, and in the air. Roosevelt had died since Yalta, and Churchill lost the general election in the middle of the conference (the results were announced on 26 July). Consequently, the new leaders were President Harry S. Truman and, from 28 July, Prime Minister Clement Attlee (who had previously been attending the conference as Churchill's deputy). THE LEADERS AT POTSDAM DISAGREED ON MANY KEY ISSUES & FREQUENTLY POSTPONED DECISIONS TO A FUTURE CONFERENCE OF FOREIGN MINISTERS. Stalin, then, had the advantage of experience, and, further, he was, according to Anthony Eden, the former British foreign minister, \"a cold, cool and a calculating negotiator who knew exactly what he wanted to get and went out to get it, never got excited, hardly ever raised his voice\" (Holmes, 541). Germany had surrendered in April 1945, and the USSR's Red Army had occupied Berlin. As the Imperial War Museum notes, Stalin was determined to get the best possible deal from his two counterparts at Potsdam: \"When asked if he felt great satisfaction at being in Berlin, Stalin replied 'Tsar Alexander got to Paris'\". Truman, after his first face-to-face meeting with Stalin and a lunch of liver, bacon, and Californian wine, wrote in his diary that the Russian leader was \"smart as hell\" (Moskin, 203). Clearly, the negotiations on what the post-war world would look like were going to be tough. Remove Ads Advertisement Germany's Punishment The attempt to reach an agreement on the war reparations Germany should pay to the victors was not successful. Stalin was determined to squeeze the maximum possible from Germany to help pay for the tremendous damage inflicted on the USSR. Truman, on the other hand, was wary that if the terms were too harsh, they might provoke a lasting hatred of the victors, such as had been seen in Germany after the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, which formally concluded the First World War. There were some points of agreement regarding Germany at Potsdam. Germany's military industry was to be dismantled. Nazi race laws like the Nuremberg Laws would be repealed, and there was to be a systematic denazification of the judicial and education systems. Potsdam Conference Delegates Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Redrawing Europe One point of discussion was the 'Poland Problem'. At Yalta, everyone had agreed there should be free elections in Poland, but Stalin had already interfered to make sure there was a pro-Soviet government installed there. Stalin was determined that Poland would be a huge buffer zone that would protect Russia from any future attack from Western Europe. The USA and Britain had, nevertheless, recognised Poland's new 'Provisional Government of National Unity' on 5 July. The reality was that the USSR's armed forces already had possession of the territory in question. The make-up of the new governments in Bulgaria and Greece was likewise disputed, with the Americans and British wanting free elections, but Stalin wanted the placement of Communists within these governments, no matter what, just as had already been done in Romania. It was decided at Potsdam that a Council of Foreign Ministers would be formed to define the new borders within Europe and decide how to carve up the various colonies of the war's losing powers. This was, in effect, a postponement of several issues where no agreement could be reached; there were many. The Council was not held until February 1947. By postponing the more prickly problems, the three leaders were at least able to press on with their quasi-cordial discussions. One issue settled at Potsdam was the decision to continue the Lend-Lease programme (material and financial aid from the USA to its Allies) to British occupation troops in Europe. Remove Ads Advertisement Achieving Victory against Japan The most important point of discussion at Potsdam was the peace terms regarding Japan. The United States had already developed the atomic bomb, a terrifying new weapon whose power was so great it was not fully understood. Indeed, Truman had delayed the Potsdam Conference in order for the first atomic bomb test to be completed in New Mexico on 16 July. Truman, then, knew by the time he arrived at Potsdam that he held in his hands the means to end the war almost immediately. The US Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, noted that news of the successful test had the following effect on Truman: \"The President was tremendously pepped up by it he said it gave him an entirely new feeling of confidence\" (Liddell Hart, 438). Leaders & Foreign Ministers at the Potsdam Conference Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) What has become known as the Potsdam Declaration was made on 27 July. The main message of the declaration was that Japan should immediately offer an unconditional surrender or else face complete destruction. The declaration was approved by both the British and Chinese governments. The declaration made no mention of the Japanese Emperor, and the Japanese government took this to mean he would not be obliged to abdicate. Japan was still fighting to hold on to each and every island and causing heavy casualties amongst the US forces. The Japanese military government ignored the declaration, despite having already made secret overtures to the government of the USSR that it was willing to consider a surrender. Inside the Japanese cabinet, it was felt that there was still some room for negotiation despite the stark terms of the declaration; certainly, they felt they had some time to further consider the ultimatum. The Japanese military government still hoped that a negotiated surrender might preserve it some vestige of power. The Potsdam Declaration, however, clearly stated this would not be tolerated and called for the removal of \"the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest\" (Dear, 864). This might or might not include the emperor. Further, the Japanese military must be disarmed, the state of Japan would henceforth be made up of only its four main islands, and war crimes trials would be conducted. The Allies hoped to foster a free and democratic Japan, where there was freedom of speech and religion and a respect for human rights. With victory in the war already assured, Truman was concerned with the supremacy of the United States in the post-war world. Without a surrender, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff expected continued and desperate resistance from the Japanese military, which still possessed some 2 million soldiers, and that, as a consequence, the war could not be won before the winter of 1946. It was estimated that victory using conventional arms would result in at least 200,000 US casualties, perhaps five times more. Further, if the USSR entered the war against Japan, as was promised and expected, that state might then make territorial claims in East Asia. The USSR, by actively helping in the defeat of Japan, would also strengthen its position in a divided Europe. Truman felt that \"only an actual atomic raid would convince Stalin of the irresistible force behind America's diplomacy\" (Liddell Hart, 438). Truman had rather vaguely informed Stalin on 24 July about the bomb (information Soviet spies had already passed on to Stalin). Truman declared that the United States had a weapon of unusual power and that he was prepared to use it against Japan. Stalin replied that this intention was a good idea. With victory in the war already assured, Truman was concerned with the supremacy of the United States in the post-war world just as much as he was with defeating Japan as quickly as possible. It is also true that the Manhattan Project to develop the bomb had cost $2 billion. To many involved in the atomic programme, it seemed unthinkable not to use the bomb now that it was ready. Remove Ads Advertisement With no response to the Potsdam Declaration, the United States government, with the formal approval of the British government, decided to drop a single atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August and another bomb on Nagasaki on 9 August. The bombs were dropped by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress planes Enola Gay and Bockscar. Over 200,000 people were killed in the attacks. On 10 August, the USSR's Red Army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria. The emperor of Japan, Hirohito, announced his country's surrender on 14 August. Truman responded to the surrender later that same day by declaring to reporters in a press conference: \"I deem this reply a full acceptance of the Potsdam declaration which specifies the unconditional surrender of Japan. In the reply there is no qualification\" (Moskin, 319). The Allies had won WWII. Hiroshima after the Atomic Bomb Attack Imperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) The Cold War Potsdam, like the Yalta Conference, proved to be something of a disappointment for the West. At Potsdam, \"agreements with Moscow were more the exception than the rule\" (Dear, 878). Truman wrote to his mother near the conference's end: \"You never saw such pigheaded people as are the Russians. I hope I never have to hold another conference with them\" (Dear, 878). There was certainly a general feeling in the United States that as the USSR increasingly defaulted on the few commitments it had made at Yalta and Potsdam, the Americans had, in effect, \"won the war but lost the peace\" (Liddell Hart, 435). It was felt by many in the West that their leaders had negotiated away control of Eastern Europe to the USSR and permitted a Soviet presence in East Asia, which could be used as a platform for further expansion of Soviet influence in that part of the world. For this reason, the United States kept occupying troops in Japan until 1952. Emperor Hirohito was permitted to keep his position, but after renouncing his divinity as claimed by the Shinto religion, his role was redefined as a constitutional monarch. Hirohito's efforts to curb the Japanese military and promote a surrender had saved him, although historians continue to dispute just how great those efforts had been in reality. There has also been much debate ever since 1945 about whether Russia's declaration of war on Japan just before the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had any influence on the Japanese government's decision to surrender, and so whether the USA's compromises concerning Asia at Yalta and Potsdam had been, in the end, strictly necessary. Between the USA and USSR and their respective allies, there developed serious suspicions as to everyone's foreign policy aims. So the Cold War began, a decline in US-Soviet relations, which saw a prolonged period of international tensions and proxy wars throughout the second half of the 20th century.",

        "content": "William Barret Travis, Commander of the Alamo Henry Arthur McArdle (Public Domain) William Barret Travis (1809 to 1836) is best-known as the commander of the Alamo during the 13-day siege (23 February to 6 March 1836), dying in the Battle of the Alamo on 6 March at the age of 26. Arguably, however, Travis should receive greater recognition as the man who almost single-handedly started the Texas Revolution with the Anahuac Disturbances of 1832 and 1835. Travis  conflict with the commander of the Anahuac garrison, Juan Davis Bradburn, in 1832, and his victory over Mexican troops in the same region in 1835, are often sidelined in discussions of the Texas Revolution as they did not lead to further engagement. The Battle of Gonzales (2 October 1835) is understood as the beginning of the revolution because it led directly to the continuous conflict that ended with the Texian victory at the Battle of San Jacinto on 21 April 1836. Remove Ads Advertisement Even so, Travis was the first member of the so-called War Party, seeking to separate Texas from Mexico, who took action, making a name for himself at Anahuac less than a year before he would die at the Alamo. And yet, prior to his arrival in Texas, it is hard to imagine a less-likely hero than William Barret Travis. Early Life The family name was originally Travers and they established themselves at the Jamestown Colony of Virginia in 1627. Berwick Travers, Travis  grandfather, later moved to the region that would become South Carolina, married Ann Smallwood, and had seven children, among them Mark and Alexander. The spelling of the family name changed from Travers to Travis and the name  Berwick  became  Barret.  William Barret Travis was born 1 August (some sources give 9 August) 1809, the son of Mark Travis and Jemima Stallworth, one of ten children. Remove Ads Advertisement Travis started a newspaper, the Claiborne Herald. Mark was a prosperous farmer and Alexander a popular preacher. In 1817, Alexander moved to Alabama and Mark soon followed with his family. William, after learning the basics at public school, continued his education at the Sparta Academy where Alexander served as superintendent. Travis was a bright student, mastering the curriculum of Greek, Latin, French, philosophy, rhetoric, geography, history, and mathematics (Davis, 193). On graduating, Alexander enrolled him at another academy in Claiborne and, when he graduated at the age of 18, he became an instructor there. William B. Travis Wiley Martin (Public Domain) He understood, however, that teaching would not provide him with the income for the life he imagined for himself. Travis apprenticed himself to the attorney James Dellet and applied himself to learning law as he had his earlier studies. At the same time, he started a newspaper, the Claiborne Herald, which he ran entirely himself, writing the articles, setting the type, and selling subscriptions. Remove Ads Advertisement While teaching, Travis had fallen in love with one of his students, Rosanna Cato (three years his junior), and the two were married 26 October 1828. Scholar J.R. Edmondson comments: Hopelessly smitten, [Travis] referred to her as  the beautiful Miss Cato.  She apparently liked what she saw. Travis had blue eyes, light, reddish-brown hair, and what one acquaintance described as  a fine Saxon face.  At nineteen years old, he had matured into a big-boned man who stood about five feet, ten inches tall. (146) At first, the couple seem to have been very happy together. Their first child, Charles Edward Travis, was born 8 August 1829, the Herald was making some money, and he was working well with Dellet. This all changed as Travis began to struggle to provide for his family, juggling his time between his law practice, the paper, his enlistment in the Alabama militia, duties at the Masonic Lodge, and his young wife and son. Still, by the time he was 20, he was a lawyer, publisher, teacher, and writer, well-respected by his community, and backed by the powerful and popular Dellet. Home of William B. Travis Jeff Reed (CC BY-SA) No matter how hard he tried, however, he could not make ends meet. He borrowed money from almost everyone he knew   his wife s brother and Dellet included   and began gambling hoping to  hit it big  to be able to pay them all back and still maintain his family and lifestyle. Gambling only added to his debt   which was around $800 (roughly $20,000 today) - and, in 1831, Dellet and the others filed suit against him. The court found against Travis and a warrant was issued for his arrest in March 1831. Remove Ads Advertisement Life with Rosanna had become increasingly difficult as he failed to provide for her and their son and, by this time, she was expecting another child. His newspaper had failed, his law practice was nearly non-existent, and now he was facing prison. He had heard of Texas as a land of new beginnings - and few lawyers - and so, telling Rosanna he would go make money there and then come back for her and square all debts, he left Claiborne   and would never return. Anglo-Americans in Texas 1823-1830 Mexico had won independence from Spain in 1821 and, to increase its tax base   as well as create a buffer between southern Mexico and Native American territory   invited Anglo-Americans to settle in the district of Coahuila y Tejas (Texas). Stephen F. Austin, like his father before him, became an empresario, selling lands to Anglo-American immigrants. Austin s initial land grants were approved by the Mexican government in 1823, bringing 300 families from the United States, many of them arriving with their slaves. The first sign of friction between Anglo-American immigrants and the Mexican authorities was the Fredonian Rebellion of 21 December 1826 to 31 January 1827 in which Anglo-American settlers under the empresario Haden Edwards declared themselves the independent Republic of Fredonia in the region near Nacogdoches. This revolt was not supported by Austin or any others outside of Edwards  settlement and was swiftly crushed by the Mexican army. Contrary to the claims of some historians, this was not the beginning of the Texas Revolution   but it certainly encouraged some, who would eventually form the War Party, to consider establishing an independent Republic of Texas. Remove Ads Advertisement In 1829, Mexico abolished slavery but, when the Anglo-Americans objected, concessions were made so that they could keep their slaves. In 1830, however, President Anastasio Bustamante rescinded these concessions through the Laws of April 6, 1830, which also banned further immigration from the USA and raised taxes on those already in Texas. The Anglo-American settlers, now calling themselves Texians, strongly objected to these laws and tensions rose between them and the regional Mexican authorities. Travis was granted land and established his law practice at Anahuac. This situation created two  parties  among the Anglo colonists   although these were never official parties, simply factions of the population   the Peace Party, which sought to negotiate better terms and laws with Mexico, and the War Party, which advocated for armed rebellion and the establishment of an independent nation. Anahuac Disturbances Into the midst of all of this rode Travis, arriving in San Felipe in 1831 as an illegal immigrant. He was granted land by Austin and established his law practice at Anahuac. On legal forms he claimed he was single or, at other times, a widower. Unlike other immigrants, Travis learned Spanish, hoping this would help him acquire more clients. He also joined the local militia and, quickly, became a prominent supporter of the War Party. His first clash with Mexican authorities came in the form of Juan Davis Bradburn, who had been born John Davis Bradburn in Virginia in 1787. He had fought in the War of 1812 at the Battle of New Orleans before enlisting in the Mexican army fighting for independence from Spain. In 1830, he was given command of the post at Anahuac. Frank W. Johnson Unknown Photographer (Public Domain) The Texians at first welcomed Bradburn, thinking that, as a fellow American, he would allow them greater freedoms. They had no idea who they were dealing with. Bradburn had fully embraced his adopted country and was intent on upholding its laws. He could not force the Texians to free their slaves without risking an uprising, but he certainly was not going to help anyone keep them. In August 1831, two slaves (sometimes given as three) escaped from a William M. Logan of Louisiana and fled to Texas. Bradburn took them in, hiring them to work on his estate. In May 1832, Logan hired Travis to get them back and, when Bradburn refused, Travis sent an anonymous letter warning him that Logan and 100 armed men would soon arrive to take the slaves by force if they were not soon surrendered. Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! Bradburn saw through the ploy and had Travis arrested for threatening a Mexican official. When Travis  law partner, Patrick C. Jack, stormed into Bradburn s office to protest, he was also arrested, as were a handful of other Texians Bradburn accused of theft. Bradburn wanted his prisoners transferred to Matamoros to be tried on charges of treason and this roused the War Party of Anahuac under Frank W. Johnson who, with his militia of around 150 men, took over the buildings around Bradburn s post, demanding he surrender Travis and the others. Johnson had captured 19 Mexican cavalry officers and negotiated an exchange while, at around this same time, others of the militia, under the command of John Austin (no relation to Stephen F. Austin), left to bring a cannon and reinforcements back from Brazoria to force Bradburn to surrender his post. While Austin was en route (and, incidentally, fighting the Battle of Fort Velasco), Bradburn agreed to Johnson s terms and the prisoners were freed. Bradburn was replaced and fled to Louisiana   and Travis became a hero of the War Party. He left Anahuac for San Felipe, where his law practice boomed, and he became a celebrity. In July 1835, he returned to Anahuac and assumed an even larger role when, commanding a force of 25 men, he captured and disarmed 40 Mexican troops who had arrested two Texians for their protests against taxes. General Martin Perfecto de Cos, the brother-in-law of General (and president) Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, ordered Travis  arrest but the Texians would not surrender him. Travis was given a commission of Lieutenant Colonel of Cavalry and then left Anahuac to return to San Felipe. Mexican General Mart n Perfecto de Cos Unknown (Public Domain) Prosperity & Romance Travis did well in San Felipe. Scholar William C. Davis writes: With Travis  growing prosperity came a steady maturing in his attitude toward debt  He engaged a friend who was traveling back to Alabama to go to Claiborne and redeem all those outstanding notes, a step on the road to regaining his reputation. (281) Since his arrival in Texas, he had sent his wife nothing by way of support, relying on her family, who had money, to care for her and his two children, Charles Edward and Susan (born in 1831 after his departure). Upon hearing that Travis had cleared all his debts in Claiborne, but had not sent her anything, Rosanna filed for divorce on grounds of abandonment, which became official in January 1836. Remove Ads Advertisement Travis, meanwhile, was making more money than ever before, purchasing and hiring out slaves, among them, Joe (the only male survivor of the Alamo). He also enjoyed the life of a bachelor in San Felipe. Beginning in 1833, Travis visited the crossing at Mill Creek where there was a popular inn operated by one John Cummings. His sister, Rebecca, attracted Travis  attention. He paid for a Christmas party held there in 1833, began a courtship, and, by February 1834, had told Rebecca about Rosanna and how he was not yet divorced but, as soon as that could be resolved, they could be married. She tentatively agreed but demanded he give up gambling, which he did. To seal their agreement, she gave him a ring which he would later give to the infant Angelina Dickinson at the Alamo and, today, can be seen in one of the exhibits in the Alamo chapel. Interior of the Alamo Chapel, 2025 Gatorfan252525 (CC BY-SA) Travis & the Texas Revolution Throughout 1834 and into 1835, Travis became increasingly involved with the War Party seeking independence from Mexico. By 1835, Santa Anna had abolished the Federalist Constitution of 1824   which had granted Anglo-Americans a voice in government, as well as other freedoms   and the War Party characterized the new Mexican government as an oppressive dictatorship. In July 1835, as noted, he returned to Anahuac to free the two Texians the War Party claimed had been unjustly arrested. He missed out on the Battle of Gonzales on 2 October of 1835, because of a bad cold and sore throat, but commanded a cavalry unit as a scout during the Siege of Bexar (12 October to 11 December 1835). The siege ended with the surrender of General Cos, who had fortified the old mission-become-fort, the Alamo and, with Cos  retreat from Texas, many felt the war was over and independence had been won. There were many others who did not believe this, however, and among them were Colonel James C. Neill, General Sam Houston, James  Jim  Bowie, and Travis. Neill had taken control of the Alamo in December 1835, and, in January 1836, Travis was sent to reinforce him, arriving at the Alamo in early February 1836. The Battle of the Alamo, 1836 Nicha Sursock (CC BY-NC-SA) Command of the Alamo Jim Bowie had gotten there earlier with orders from Houston to remove all ordnance and destroy the fort. He and Neill, however, felt the Alamo should be held against what they saw as the inevitable return of Santa Anna s forces. On 11 February, Neill left to tend to personal business and Travis assumed his command. This led to a dispute between Bowie and Travis as to who should command the garrison overall. Remove Ads Advertisement A compromise was reached in which Travis would command his men and Neill s and Bowie would have authority over his own. Any decisions affecting the entire garrison would be made together. Travis was certain that Santa Anna, if he did come, would not arrive before mid-to-late March and sent out letters asking for reinforcements   especially to Colonel James W. Fannin at Goliad   while he supervised repairs to the Alamo s walls. Reports that Santa Anna was marching toward the Alamo began as early as 14 February, but these were dismissed as rumors and gossip. On 23 February, Santa Anna marched into San Antonio de Bexar   and the siege of the Alamo began. On the 24th, Bowie fell ill, and Travis assumed sole command of the garrison. Plaque of William Barret Travis's Letter from the Alamo Betsy Mark (CC BY-NC-SA) Siege & Battle of the Alamo On 24 February, Travis sent the most famous letter of his many asking for help   the so-called Travis Letter   also known as the  Victory or Death  Letter: To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World: Fellow citizens and compatriots -I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism and everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country. VICTORY or DEATH. William Barret Travis Lt. Col. Comdt. P.S. The Lord is on our side. When the enemy appeared in sight, we had not three bushels of corn. We have since found in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels and got into the walls 20 or 30 head of Beeves. Travis (Groneman, 4) This letter, hailed as  the most patriotic , has become famous world-wide and would later encourage others to flock to the cause of Texas liberty, but, sadly for Travis, did little to bring reinforcements to the Alamo. On 1 March, 32 volunteers from Gonzales arrived but Fannin failed spectacularly in his paltry attempt to lend aid and wound up dying in the Goliad Massacre on 27 March 1836. Sam Houston dismissed the letter as a literary exaggeration and refused to believe Santa Anna was even in Texas until 11 March when Susanna Dickinson (with her infant daughter Angelina) and Travis' slave, Joe, brought word to Gonzales that the Alamo had fallen. According to Alamo lore, on 5 March, Travis drew a line in the sand of the Alamo courtyard, informing the garrison that their situation was hopeless without reinforcement, and asking anyone who would stand with him to step across - any others were free to leave. Only one man, Louis Moses Rose, is said to have left. Travis held the Alamo against overwhelming odds for 13 days and was among the first to die in the assault of 6 March. All the defenders of the Alamo were killed, including David  Davy  Crockett of Tennessee. William B. Travis Plaque Betsy Mark (CC BY-NC-SA) Conclusion Possibly before, but certainly after his arrival in Texas, Travis came to see himself as a great romantic hero, along the lines of King Arthur, fighting for the cause of right against what he saw as the forces of darkness. Although his early life would hardly suggest a future as a great hero of Texas liberty and personal sacrifice, through his self-image, he became what he believed himself to be, even dying for it. Travis features prominently on the Alamo cenotaph, commissioned in 1936 for the Texan Centennial, and has been portrayed in many TV shows, documentaries, and movies, notably by Lawrence Harvey in The Alamo (1960), by Alec Baldwin in The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory (1987), and by Patrick Wilson in The Alamo (2004)   considered the most accurate film version of the siege, battle, and Travis himself. Remove Ads Advertisement Any honest appraisal of William Barret Travis today must acknowledge his abandonment of his family and role as a slave owner but, at the same time, should give credit to the man who, like many Americans, reinvented and redeemed himself. Travis now has schools, streets, and monuments named in his honor and, in death, achieved all he wanted in life: to become a great man worthy of respect - a hero.",

        "content": "Raid on Deerfield, 1704 Walter Henry Lippincott (Public Domain) Queen Anne s War (1702-1713) was the second major colonial conflict in North America, fought between the colonies of England   Great Britain after 1707   and those of France and Spain, each side aided by their respective Native American allies. An extension of a larger European conflict, the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), Queen Anne s War had its own unique origins, stemming from the tempestuous politics of Colonial America. The war officially began when Anne, Queen of Great Britain (reign 1702-1714)   after whom the North American conflict was named   declared war on France and Spain, in response to a dispute over who would inherit the Spanish throne. This dynastic war, though of little significance to the colonists on the North American frontier, would nevertheless reignite tensions that had been simmering since the last colonial war. New France, for instance, was quarreling with its English rivals over control of the lucrative fur trade as well as over a border dispute between its colony of Acadia and the New England territory of Maine. The indigenous Wabanaki Confederacy had a generations-long feud with the New England colonies as well, stretching back to the violence of King Philip s War (1675-1678). And, in the south, the English Province of Carolina contended with its own rival, Spanish Florida, which sometimes authorized Native American raids into Carolinian territory. So, when word of Queen Anne s declaration of war reached American shores, the colonies and Native American nations readily engaged in a ferocious war of their own characterized by bloody cycles of retaliatory raids and deadly frontier skirmishes. Remove Ads Advertisement New France had long been struggling with its English rivals over control of the lucrative beaver pelt trade. Background At the turn of the 18th century, Colonial America was a tinderbox. Decades of tensions, arising from issues such as border disputes, dishonored treaties, and the struggle over resources, had already led to the bloodletting of King William s War (1688-1697). However, this conflict, quite limited in scope, had achieved little besides the burning of frontier villages and the killing or kidnapping of their inhabitants, serving to heighten the animosity between the English colonies on one side, and New France on the other. One major point of contention was in the northeast, in modern-day Maine, which was claimed both by the French colony of Acadia (modern-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and the New England colonies. Maine had been the site of the most brutal fighting of the previous war, its settlements still scarred by the flames, the graves of the slain still fresh in its soil. New France had also long been struggling with its English rivals over control of the lucrative beaver pelt trade in the Great Lakes region. While the English enjoyed a numerical advantage over their French rivals   the population of the English colonies was approaching 200,000 by 1700, while New France had less than 20,000   the French had better leadership and more settlers with military experience, helping to even the odds. Anne, Queen of Great Britain Unknown Artist (Public Domain) Though the rivalry between these two European powers lay at the center of the political tensions, a few powerful Indigenous polities could not be ignored. One of these, the Wabanaki Confederacy, had been fighting against the New Englanders for decades; several times, the Wabanakis and the English had signed peace treaties, only for the English to later trample over these agreements and encroach further onto Wabanaki land. In response, the Wabanakis had aligned themselves closer with the French, intermarrying with French settlers and allowing Jesuit missionaries in their midst. During King William s War, it had been the Wabanakis who had conducted most of the raids on New England towns, striking terror and fear into the hearts of the English settlers. Another Native American polity was the Iroquois Confederacy, which had been allied with the English during King William s War only to find themselves abandoned at the end of it. When the English made peace with the French in 1697, they neglected to provide for their Iroquois allies. Thus, the Iroquois were left to keep fighting the French by themselves. Many of their villages were burned and people killed by the vengeful French, before the Iroquois were able to finalize their own peace treaty in 1701. The Iroquois, understandably, accused the English of abandoning them, and were unlikely to want to help should a second colonial war break out. Remove Ads Advertisement A cycle of retaliatory raids continued between the Spanish in Florida and the English in Carolina. Such a war, it would turn out, was not long in coming. But the spark that would ignite this North American tinderbox would come from thousands of miles away, over in Europe. In November 1700, King Charles II of Spain died without children. The vacant Spanish throne was duly claimed by a member of the French Bourbon dynasty, a grandson of King Louis XIV, a move that alarmed some of the other European nations who feared that a union between France and Spain would upset the delicate balance of power. These nations, a powerful coalition including England, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Dutch Republic, instead favored a candidate from the Habsburg dynasty to succeed to the throne of Spain. This dispute ultimately led to the War of the Spanish Succession, as the pro-Bourbon and pro-Habsburg alliances vied for control of the Spanish Empire. At first, England and France tried to make a deal to keep their overseas colonies neutral in the struggle. But, by the time word reached Colonial America that war had broken out in Europe in 1702, there was nothing that could put the genie back in the bottle. A new colonial war had begun. War in the South Unlike King William s War, which had been mostly confined to New England and Canada, this new conflict would be fought on a wider scale, with the first salvoes of fighting fired off in the South. By this point, both the English and French colonists were racing to secure trade access to the Mississippi River; the Province of Carolina, then the southernmost of the English colonies, was so far winning this race, having established a lucrative trade network touching the banks of the Mississippi. Pierre Le Moyne d Iberville, a French explorer and trader, was eager to break up this Carolinian trade network. At the start of the war, he went to Spanish Florida and urged the pro-Bourbon commander of Pensacola to arm the local Apalachee natives and send them into Carolina to wreak havoc. This was done and, in August 1702, a Spanish-led Apalachee war party began raiding the trading posts of the Carolina backcountry. The English quickly put together an army of their own to meet this threat and fought the Spanish and Apalachee at the Battle of Flint River in October 1702. The battle was a resounding English victory; 500 Apalachee warriors were killed or wounded, the rest forced back into Spanish Florida. Remove Ads Advertisement Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville Unknown Artist (Public Domain) James Moore, the governor of Carolina, was not about to let them get away so easily. That autumn, he raised a force of 500 English militia and 300 Indigenous allies   mostly Muscogee   and personally led them in an invasion of Spanish Florida. On 10 November 1702, Moore laid siege to St. Augustine, burning the outlying Spanish communities. For over a month, the English continued to lay siege, but their guns had little impact on the strong walls of St. Augustine. When a Spanish relief force arrived from Havana on 29 December, Moore lifted the siege and pulled his forces back to Charles Town (Charleston). The following year, he led 50 English militia and over 1,000 allied Muscogee warriors back into Florida, burning the Spanish missions to the west of St. Augustine. This campaign of retribution climaxed in January 1704, when Moore s men conducted a series of raids against the Apalachee villages. Moore himself would later claim to have killed over 1,100 Apalachee men, women, and children, and to have forced another 4,300 into slavery. Many of the survivors were forced onto reservations along the Savannah River. In 1706, the French and Spanish retaliated with a joint attack on Charles Town, although this ultimately failed. The next several years saw this cycle of retaliatory raids continue between the Spanish in Florida and the English in Carolina. War in New England To the north, the series of bloody border raids that had characterized King William s War resumed with a new fury. In early 1703, a French-led force of 500 Wabanaki warriors moved down from Acadia and burned several English settlements in Maine including Wells and Falmouth (present-day Portland). English settlers who had survived the bloodshed of the previous decade must have looked on in horror as their rebuilt settlements went up in flames, their family members slaughtered or carried off to Canada as captives. Indeed, during the French and Wabanaki raids of 1703, over 300 English settlers were either killed or taken captive. But the most infamous raid of the war would occur the following year, when a French military officer, Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville, led a band of 250 Abenaki and Caughnawaga warriors to the sleepy town of Deerfield, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. At 4 am on 29 February 1704, they silently crept across the outlying snow-covered fields, entered the undefended town, and proceeded to rip the English colonists from their beds. 47 men, women, and children were killed outright, while 112 others were rounded up and taken as captives. These captives were dragged over 300 miles to the French settlement of Montreal, some of them dying enroute. The survivors were either assimilated into the Abenaki tribe   a custom practiced by some Native American nations to replace losses to their communities   or ransomed back to Massachusetts. In 1704, the English retaliated to these raids by sending an expedition of their own into Acadia. This was led by Colonel Benjamin Church, a renowned Indigenous fighter who had won fame in the bloody battles of both King Philip s War and King William s War. Church raided several Acadian settlements, repaying the French and Wabanakis with fire and blood. Some accounts claim that Church made an attempt to attack Port Royal, the capital of Acadia, but found it too well defended and gave up, returning to New Hampshire. In 1705, the French and their Wabanaki allies made new raids into northern Massachusetts. They were quick with their bloody business and were oftentimes long gone before the local militia could mount any kind of defense. Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley soon realized that the best way to defend his colony was to launch an offensive into New France. In May 1707, he organized a 1,600-man expedition to seize Port Royal. Like Church before them, these New England troops found Port Royal s defenses too strong and were repulsed after a brief siege. By now, it had become clear that the New Englanders needed help if they were to turn the tide against the French and Wabanaki raids. Such help would have to come from the dormant Iroquois Confederacy, still neutral and licking its wounds from the last war. Remove Ads Advertisement English Raid on Grand Pre, 1704 Hezekiah Butterwort (Public Domain) But indeed, most of the Iroquois were in no mood to help. Except for the Mohawks, the most Anglophile of the confederacy s Five Nations, the Iroquois were mistrustful of the English, remembering how they had betrayed them at the end of the last war. In fact, some of the Iroquois, particularly the Onondaga and upper Seneca nations, were beginning to favor forging stronger ties with the French, and had allowed French Jesuit missionaries amongst their communities. Alarmed, the Province of New York sent its Indian commissioner, Peter Schuyler, to remind the Iroquois of their old alliance with the English, known as the Covenant Chain, and to draw them back into the fold. After multiple meetings, the Iroquois still refused to offer full military support, though they soothed Schuyler with vague promises of help. In the meantime, some Iroquois provided the French with word of Schuyler s attempts to invoke the Covenant Chain as well as the English military plans he had shown them   by playing both sides, the Iroquois proved once again that they were shrewd political operators, ensuring their own survival by making sure that both of the European powers relied on them. But while Schuyler attempted to get help from the Iroquois, other colonials were looking for support from across the ocean, in the person of Queen Anne herself. Attacks on Canada In 1708, Samuel Vetch, a Scottish merchant with colonial ties, planned a two-pronged offensive to capture Quebec, the capital of New France. Time and again, Vetch had witnessed the French grant sanctuary to the Wabanakis after their destructive raids on English settlements, leading him to the conclusion that the only way to ensure New England s security was to expel the French from North America altogether. To this end, he travelled to London and appealed to Queen Anne herself for military support from Great Britain (England was merged into Great Britain with the Acts of Union in 1707). The queen approved of Vetch s  grand enterprise  and offered to provide ships for his campaign. The next year, Vetch and his collaborator, colonial official Francis Nicholson, put together their expedition: one army of 1,500 men would march overland to capture Montreal while another 1,000-man force would sail to Quebec aboard British ships. This ambitious campaign, however, had to be called off when the promised British ships never materialized; indeed, they had been rerouted for military operations off Portugal. Frustratingly, the North American theater had proved to be nothing more than a sideshow for the generals of Europe. The two men refused to give up. In early 1710, they returned to London, this time in the company of four Indigenous chiefs, three of whom were Iroquois from the pro-English Mohawk nation. The presence of these so-called  Four Mohawk Kings  caused a great sensation in London. The chiefs were carried through the streets in royal carriages, banqueted by the Board of Trade, and even treated to a performance of William Shakespeare's Macbeth where they were allowed to sit on stage. When the Indigenous chiefs were granted an audience with the queen, they asked for military assistance against the French, as well as Anglican missionaries to go amongst their villages and offset the influence of the Jesuits. This move, calculated by Nicholson and Vetch, made it difficult for the queen to refuse. So, in July 1710, Nicholson returned to Boston with 400 marines brought over from Britain. He recruited 1,500 militiamen from the colonies and, in late September, set sail aboard a fleet consisting of 36 transports and 5 British warships. The British and colonists arrived outside Port Royal and captured it on 13 October after a week-long siege. Nicholson s forces promptly occupied it and renamed it Annapolis Royal in honor of the queen. Remove Ads Advertisement Four Mohawk Kings Contingent Identity (CC BY-SA) Emboldened by this success, Nicholson returned to London in 1711 to ask for support for another offensive against Quebec. This was granted and, in June, a fleet of 15 ships-of-the-line arrived in Boston under Admiral Hovenden Walker, transporting 5,000 British soldiers. This was, up to that point, the largest military force that Britain had ever offered in support of its North American colonies. The expedition had to set off quickly   the then small town of Boston could barely afford to feed this influx of mouths   and sailed for Quebec at the end of July. But, as the fleet approached the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, it sailed into a thick fog. Several ships were wrecked on the rocky shores and sank, with as many as 700 soldiers drowning. After this calamity, Admiral Walker had no choice but to call off the expedition. Nicholson, meanwhile, was leading a concurrent overland expedition to capture Montreal which included some Iroquois scouts. However, once he learned of Walker s failure, he promptly called off his expedition and turned back to Albany, New York. Peace In 1712, an armistice was reached between Britain and France, and a final peace treaty was signed the following year. In the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Philip V   the Bourbon candidate   was recognized as king of Spain, in return for his renunciation of all claims to the French throne. But where Britain really gained the most was in North America; France ceded control of Acadia, Newfoundland, the Hudson Bay area, and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts to Britain. In return, the French kept control of  le-Royale (modern-day Cape Breton Island) and retained the right to fish off the coast of Newfoundland. The Treaty of Utrecht did not provide for the Wabanakis, who made a separate peace with the New England colonies in July 1713. In the ensuing Treaty of Portsmouth, the Wabanakis and New Englanders established a boundary at the Kennebec River   thereby resolving the long-running border dispute in Maine   and the Wabanakis allowed the colonists to establish trading posts in their territory. Thus, Queen Anne s War was over. Unlike King William s War, which had achieved nothing and restored the prewar status quo, Queen Anne s War ended in a British victory, shoring up the British presence in modern-day Canada at the expense of the French. Indeed, the French, wary of losing their remaining Canadian territories, spent the following years building a mighty fortress on Cape Breton Island that they named Louisbourg; this would serve as a major point of contention between the French and the British, raising tensions in the region. In the former French colony of Acadia   renamed Nova Scotia by the British   many Acadians refused to swear allegiance to the British Crown and left for other French controlled colonies. The Iroquois had retained their neutrality during the course of the war. However, in the Treaty of Utrecht, they had been recognized as British subjects, aligning them further with the British colonies, whether they wanted to or not. Though the colonial map of North America had changed, animosities between all the major players remained as strong as ever, leading to the third great colonial conflict King George s War (1744-1748).",

        "content": "French and Wabanakis Attack Schenectady, 1690 Unknown Artist (Public Domain) King William s War (1688-1697) was the first of four major colonial conflicts fought between England, France, and their respective Native American allies in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though the war had its own unique origins, it coincided with a larger European conflict   the Nine Years  War   marking the first time that Colonial America was swept up in the imperial struggles of the Old World. Though the war was named after King William III of England (reign 1689-1702), it had more to do with the political situation in North America than with the grand designs of European kings. Tensions between the New England colonies and the indigenous Wabanaki Confederacy remained high in the aftermath of King Philip s War (1675-1678). Mistrustful of the intentions of the English, the Wabanaki aligned themselves with New France, the other major colonial power in the region. The French, in turn, were concerned with protecting their lucrative fur trade from the machinations of the powerful Iroquois Confederacy, who were allied with the English in New York. Once word arrived from across the ocean that England and France were at war, the North American powder keg exploded; for the next several years, the French and Wabanaki launched several bloody raids against the English and Iroquois, who responded in kind. The backwoods bloodshed would continue until 1697, when the Treaty of Ryswick ended most of the fighting and restored the prewar borders. Tensions would continue to simmer until the outbreak of the next great colonial conflict, Queen Anne s War (1702-1713). Remove Ads Advertisement Background In the decade that followed the devastation of King Philip s War, an uneasy peace settled over New England. The peace, though fragile, was certainly welcome, since the war that preceded it had been bitter and hard-fought. The Wampanoag Confederacy, once the dominant power in the region, had attacked the New England colonies in a desperate bit to stop the white settlers from encroaching onto their lands. Thousands of men, women, and children had died in the struggle that followed, dozens of villages, both indigenous and English, razed to the ground. But now, Metacomet   the Wampanoag chieftain who had started the war, known to the English as  King Philip    was dead, felled by an assassin s bullet, his severed head adorning a pike at the entrance to Plymouth, Massachusetts, where it would molder for the next two decades. His followers, those who had not already been killed, were either rounded up and executed or sold into slavery, while the other Wampanoags were forced onto reservations and made to watch as the triumphant New Englanders gobbled up their ancestral lands. The balance of power in the northeast had forever shifted; the strength of the Wampanoag Confederacy had been broken, the hegemony of the English ascendent. The Wabanakis, cognizant of the way the English had treated the Wampanoags, remained wary. But no sooner had the bloodshed of King Philip s War given way to peace then Increase Mather, the preeminent minister in Boston, predicted the coming of another conflict:  There seems to be a dark cloud rising from the east in respect of Indians in those parts; yea, a cloud which streameth forth in blood  (quoted in Pulsipher, 588). Indeed, the Wampanoags had not been the only Native Americans contending with the English for control of the northeast. In the French colony of Acadia   roughly corresponding to the modern-day Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick   lived the Wabanaki people, or  people of the Dawnland . During King Philip s War, the Wabanakis had raided English settlements in New Hampshire and Maine, wreaking such havoc as to completely drive the terrified Englishmen away. In 1678, the war weary governments of New England signed a peace treaty with the Wabanakis. The Wabanakis would agree to let the English return to their abandoned settlements, and, in exchange, the English would recognize Wabanaki sovereignty and pay them an annual tribute in corn. For a while, this peace seemed to hold although the Wabanakis, cognizant of the way the English had treated the Wampanoags, remained wary. Remove Ads Advertisement Sir Edmund Andros Mary Beale (Public Domain) To better prepare themselves for the eventuality of an English betrayal, the five Wabanaki nations (Abenaki, Mi kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot) organized themselves into the Wabanaki Confederacy. They also pursued closer relations with New France, intermarrying with French settlers and allowing Jesuit missionaries into their midst. The French, of course, were the other dominant European presence in the region, vying with the English for control of the lucrative fur trade. Although the French were less permanently established in North America than their English rivals   in 1689, for instance, New France had a population of only 14,000, compared to the 154,000 people living in the English colonies   they were able to maintain their grip on the fur trade through a web of strong alliances with local Native American groups, like the Wabanaki. But in 1680, the string of alliances that upheld the French fur trade came under threat when the powerful Iroquois Confederacy attacked several of New France s indigenous allies in the Great Lakes region. The Iroquois had recently formed an alliance with the English government of New York, called the Covenant Chain, leading the French to suspect that they had acted with the blessing   if not by the direct instigation   of the English. In retaliation, the French raided several Iroquois villages in New York, thereby challenging both the Iroquois and the English. The stage was set for another conflict; the clouds of war, as foreseen by Increase Mather, looked quite dark indeed. In early 1689, monumental events in Europe would once again affect the destiny of the New World. First Blood In April 1688, amidst all this escalating violence, Sir Edmund Andros led an expedition to Saint-Castin s Trading House in Maine. Andros was the unpopular governor of the Dominion of New England, a short-lived conglomeration of the New England colonies under a single, royally appointed government. An authoritative man, Andros sought to flex his powers by resolving a border dispute between Maine and Acadia. He led his soldiers to Penobscot Bay where they plundered both the home and trading post of Baron Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin, a French military officer and trader who had set up shop on land claimed by Andros. Saint-Castin, who had married a Penobscot woman and had mixed-race sons by her, was well respected in the Wabanaki Confederacy; the attack on his property was viewed as an insult to the Wabanaki as a whole. Around the same time, 16 Wabanaki men were arrested in Maine on the orders of Governor Andros on the pretense that they had killed English cattle, and were sent to Boston for imprisonment. Wabanaki patience with their English neighbors had already been running thin   the New Englanders had slowly been violating the 1678 treaty by settling on Wabanaki lands and stopping payment of the corn tribute   but these two incidents were the final straw. Remove Ads Advertisement In August 1688, Saint-Castin led a party of Wabanaki warriors on raids against several English settlements in Maine. A few English settlers were killed in these scuffles, and several more were taken captive. When he learned of these raids, Governor Andros realized that he may have accidentally started a new Indian war and tried to deescalate, ordering the release of the 16 Wabanaki prisoners in Boston. But when Saint-Castin refused to release his own prisoners, Andros shifted tactics and led an army of 700 men into Maine in early November. By then, Saint-Castin and the Wabanakis had already withdrawn into Acadia, and the New Englanders accomplished little besides simply tramping around the wilderness. At the end of the year, Andros returned to Boston but left his troops behind in Maine to keep the peace, stationing them in several frontier posts. But, the following spring, news arrived from Europe that would change everything   the Glorious Revolution had broken out in England. King James II of England had been forced to abdicate, leading to the ascension of William of Orange and his wife Mary to the joint rule of the kingdom. The shockwaves of revolution reverberated throughout the colonies; Andros was overthrown by a mob in Boston, and the Dominion of New England dismantled. Because of the chaos, most of the English soldiers returned to Massachusetts, leaving Maine once again undefended. Benjamin Church, c. 1675 Unknown Artist (Public Domain) Three Raids In early 1689, monumental events in Europe would once again affect the destiny of the New World. The newly crowned William III of England joined together with Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, to form a  Grand Alliance  against the expansionist ambitions of King Louis XIV of France. In May, William and Leopold officially declared war on France, beginning a conflict that would become known as the Nine Years  War. Though the kings and generals of Europe hardly paid any thought to the backwoods of North America half a world away, this official declaration of war gave the colonies leave to attack one another with renewed vigor. News of the expanded European conflict had not yet reached the little settlement of Dover, New Hampshire, when, on the night of 27 June 1689, a pair of Wabanaki women arrived and asked for shelter. This was granted and, in the middle of the night, the women threw open the town gates to let in scores of Wabanaki warriors. 20 English settlers were massacred that night, including Major Richard Waldron, the town s leading citizen. During King Philip s War, Waldron had used trickery to capture hundreds of Wabanakis before selling them into slavery. Eager to repay this debt, the Wabanaki warriors now burst into his bedroom, clubbed him over the head, and dragged him into the next room where they tied him to a chair and tortured him to death. The Wabanakis then absconded from the ruined settlement with 29 English prisoners, who were sold into captivity in New France. In August 1689, Saint-Castin once again invaded Maine at the head of a Wabanaki war party, this time sharing command with the French missionary Father Louis-Pierre Thury. They surrounded the English fort at Pemaquid, capturing or killing any English settlers who failed to make it to the safety of the fort s palisades in time. The garrison held out for a day but, after sustaining heavy casualties, opted to surrender; Saint-Castin had both the fort and the nearby town burned to the ground. The raids on Dover and Pemaquid were a clear escalation of hostilities and, after the declaration of war in Europe became known, the English were eager to retaliate. A 1,500-man Iroquois war party was sent into New France to raid the settlement of Lachine, while Major Benjamin Church led 250 Massachusetts soldiers on an expedition to defend English settlers in Maine. Church held a fearsome reputation as an Indian fighter and, indeed, had led the party that had hunted down and killed Metacomet back in 1676. On 21 September 1689, Church would once again make a name for himself, when his men defended the English settlers at Falmouth (present-day Portland, Maine) against a larger Acadian and Wabanaki force. Church beat back the enemy at the cost of 21 casualties, saving the Falmouth settlers from likely slaughter. Remove Ads Advertisement Death of Major Richard Waldron Unknown Artist (Public Domain) Escalations In early 1690, the scale of the conflict expanded once again. The governor-general of New France, Louis de Baude, Comte de Frontenac, ordered several concurrent military expeditions against the English colonies. The first expedition, led by French officers and consisting of Wabanaki warriors, made its way to Schenectady, New York, on the night of 8 February 1690. Finding the town undefended, they attacked, massacring 60 residents (including 11 enslaved African Americans) and absconding with 27 captives. The second expedition, led by Saint-Castin, razed the town of Salmon Falls, on the border between New Hampshire and Maine, on 27 March, killing 34 English settlers. Saint-Castin s expedition then wound its way into Maine, falling upon the Falmouth settlement that Church had defended the year before. This time, there was no one to protect the English settlers; Saint-Castin butchered the men, took the women and children prisoner, and burned the settlement to the ground. Church learned of the attack too late and arrived at Falmouth with little to do but bury the dead. Frontenac s attacks did not long go unanswered. On 23 April 1690, seven English warships sailed out of Boston carrying 736 provincial militiamen under Sir William Phips, a Maine-borne treasure hunter who now sought the glory of a military victory. On 9 May, the New Englanders arrived outside Port Royal, the capital of Acadia, taking the 90-man French garrison by surprise. Realizing they could not withstand a siege, the French surrendered. Phips imprisoned the French soldiers and Acadian townspeople in the church before turning a blind eye as his soldiers plundered the town, on the pretext that the French had somehow violated the terms of surrender. Phips left soon after, but additional English warships returned to Port Royal the following month, leading to another round of burning and looting. In September, Church led a second expedition of 300 men into Acadia. He travelled up the Androscoggin River, raiding Wabanaki villages and butchering several of their men. After freeing five English captives from a Wabanaki wigwam, Church claimed victory and returned to New Hampshire. Count Frontenac with Indigenous Allies Charles William Jefferys (Public Domain) Emboldened by these successes, the English decided to launch full-scale invasions of New France. One expedition, under Fitz-John Winthrop, set out overland toward Montreal. However, disease, lack of provisions, and disagreements among officers forced this army to turn back before it reached its target. The second expedition, under Phips, targeted Quebec, capital of New France. In late August, Phips sailed out of Boston with 2,300 militiamen aboard 32 ships. But thanks to poor weather, he did not make it to Quebec until 16 October. Frontenac, appraised of Phips s coming, had had ample time to prepare, and had gathered 3,000 soldiers for the town s defense, including three battalions of colonial regulars. When Phips sent an emissary to demand Frontenac s surrender, the French governor-general felt confident enough to say:  I have no reply to make to your general other than from the mouths of my cannons and muskets  (Canadian Biography). Phips was up to the challenge. On 18 October, he landed his men four miles below Quebec, but they had no sooner begun their march toward the town then they came under fire from French militia and their Wabanaki allies, sheltering in the dense forest. The next day, Phips s warships opened a cannonade against the town but ran out of ammunition quicker than expected. The New England militiamen, already battered from their skirmishes in the woods, refused to assault Quebec without artillery support, forcing Phips to call off the attack. On 23 October, he negotiated a prisoner exchange with Frontenac before loading his men back on the ships and setting sail for Boston. Remove Ads Advertisement The War Rages On For the next several years, the cycle of retaliatory raids continued. In 1691, a Wabanaki war party raided the town of Wells in Maine, before travelling to the coastline, boarding an English vessel, and slaughtering its crew. On 24 January 1692, Father Louis-Pierre Thury and Penobscot Chief Madockawando led 300 Acadians and Wabanakis to the town of York   that night, they slaughtered over 100 English settlers and took 80 captives, in an event known as the Candlemas Massacre. Such surprise attacks caused a wave of fear to spread throughout the English colonies, as every frontier settlement wondered if it would be the next to suffer the French and Wabanaki wrath; some scholars speculate that this hysteria helped fuel the infamous Salem Witch Trials of 1692-93. The English responded to these raids in kind. Church led a third expedition into Acadia in 1692, burning and pillaging as he went, and the following year, English frigates returned to Port Royal to burn it for a third time. Battle of Quebec in 1690 Charles Van Tenac (Public Domain) In 1693, tired of the fighting, English officials in Boston entered peace negotiations with the Abenaki, part of the Wabanaki Confederacy. Frontenac, wishing to disrupt such negotiations, sent one of his officers, Claude-S bastian de Villieu, to stir up trouble. Villieu travelled from village to village, recruiting Abenakis that were against the peace treaty and, on 18 July 1694, led 250 of them in an attack on Durham, New Hampshire. In the ensuing slaughter   known afterward as the Oyster River massacre   104 English settlers were killed, 27 taken captive. Villieu killed the livestock and burned the crops, manufacturing a famine for the survivors. The war then settled into a lull until 1696, when the French launched a largescale attack on Iroquois towns in New York and Saint-Castin led a raid on the rebuilt English fort of Pemaquid. After successfully taking the fort, Saint-Castin went on to raze nearly every English settlement in Newfoundland, resulting in over 100 deaths. Church once again retaliated by launching his fourth and final expedition into Acadia. End of the War On 30 October 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick was signed in Europe, ending the Nine Years  War and   by extension   ending King William s War as well. Among other things, the treaty stipulated that New France, New England, and New York would all return to their prewar boundaries, thereby leaving several border disputes   like the one between Acadia and Maine   unresolved. Though England and France were now formally at peace, scattered fighting between the English and Wabanaki continued until January 1699, when the two parties signed a treaty in Casco Bay, Maine. The Iroquois, likewise, remained at war with the French. Frontenac, looking to get revenge on the Iroquois for their raids into New France, launched several devastating attacks on Iroquois villages in the late 1690s. The Iroquois appealed to their allies in New York for help but the English, tired of fighting, remained indifferent. It was not until 1701 that the Iroquois finally made peace with the French. The end of the war did nothing to resolve the high tensions in North America. Indeed, these tensions would soon spill over into the second great colonial conflict of the era, Queen Anne s War.",

        "content": "Balnuaran of Clava Dave Conner (CC BY-NC-SA) Clava Cairns is an early Bronze Age site in Scotland, located east of the city of Inverness, consisting of three well-preserved cairns (two of which are passage graves) and a number of free-standing stones strategically placed for astronomical purposes. The full name of the site is the Prehistoric Burial Cairns of the Balnuaran of Clava which is usually shortened to The Balnuaran of Clava and, informally, Clava Cairns. Although formerly classified as a Neolithic Period site, in 2000 Professor Richard Bradley conclusively proved it was constructed in the Bronze Age and, since the publication of his work, similarities between the monuments at Clava Cairns and other Bronze Age sites have been increasingly noted. Remove Ads Advertisement Clava Cairns has become increasingly popular since the publication of the Outlander books (and later TV series) by Diana Gabaldon as many have claimed that the site inspired her first work. Gabaldon, however, has denied this, noting that she had not yet visited Scotland and knew nothing of Clava Cairns when she wrote the first book. Date & Name The cairns date from circa 2500 BCE, but the location is thought to have been in use much earlier, and later additions date to circa 2000 BCE. The site was in continual use for over 1000 years and evidence suggests reuse by communities, intermittently, until 770 as a burial ground and center for rituals. The cairns themselves have been identified as graves but were clearly constructed with astronomical alignments in mind. Scholars Alwyn and Brinley Rees define the meaning of a cairn: Remove Ads Advertisement A cairn is a mound of stones erected over a burial or at some other point with other-world associations, such as wherever a man has died out-of-doors or where a coffin has rested. (188) Even so, a cairn may also represent wholeness and specifically the whole of a country, of a collective people, such as those in Ireland or Scotland, which both have a significant number of cairns throughout. The scholars Rees discuss the significance of the cairns of Ireland: Every beehive tomb in Greece is a symbol of the omphalos ('navel' of the earth); every stupa (gravemound) in India is a miniature of Mount Meru in the middle of the world. In Yorubaland, [the ethnologist] Leo Frobenius found little clay cult objects which consisted of a central cone, representing the god of world order, with four smaller cones around it representing the gods of the cardinal points. Similarly, every cairn in Ireland represents the whole. (187-188) In this same way, it is thought, Clava Cairns represented Scotland as a whole but, more importantly, Scotland's specific place in the universe. According to Andis Kaulins of Megaliths.net, 'Bal' meant 'Pole' and 'Nuaran' 'River of Light', thus linking the site to the Milky Way and designating Balnuaran as the center of the heavens from which the ancients could chart the stars. Remove Ads Advertisement Clava Cairns, Scotland Holly Hayes (CC BY-NC-SA) This may well be, and the site certainly has astronomical significance, but researcher-writer London Crotty of the University of North Carolina Greensboro, offers a simpler and more grounded definition of Balnuaran as \"Home of the Nairn\" noting how \"Bal\" (the anglicized version of Scottish Gaelic baile) means \"village\" or \"home\" while \"Narann\" (also given as \"Nuaran\") is the Scottish Gaelic for \"Nairn\", as in the River Nairn that flows past the site (personal email, October 2025). This definition still suggests Clava Cairns as a \"pole\"   a notable spot   on a river that is part of the lives of Scottish communities for 35 miles (56 km), linking the site to the greater whole. There are 45 other cairns in the Inverness-Nairn valley which form a definite pattern corresponding to the planets, but this particular site seems to have a special resonance with the people as evidenced by the construction of the cairns in their original state, which differs from other sites on a grander scale. it was once not only an astronomical observatory but also a burial ground for the most prestigious members of the local community. Scholarship on the site agrees that it was once not only an astronomical observatory but also a burial ground for the most prestigious members of the local community. It is evident that the cairns were constructed to honor the dead but, at the same time, to mark the passing of the seasons and provide people with a means of regulating a calendar. Remove Ads Advertisement The passage graves are aligned to the winter solstice and the standing stones, likewise, serve astronomical purposes. At the same time, however, the monuments may have served a spiritual/religious purpose as physical evidence of their original lavish construction and ring-and-cup marks on the stones suggests. The Cairns at Clava Excavations at the site began in 1828 and continued, at intervals, through the 1990's. The most recent, and extensive, work has been done by Professor Richard Bradley whose work The Good Stones: A New Investigation of the Clava Cairns maintains that the location of the cairns was not only essential to astronomical observations but also to communication between different communities in different regions. The site is located at the northeastern end of the Great Glen of the Highlands of Scotland which people used   and still do today   in traveling from the north of Scotland to the south and west. Clava Cairns, then, could have served as some central meeting place which clans far to the south could have easily located; all they would have to do would be to follow the Great Glen north to the \"Home of the Nairn.\" Remove Ads Advertisement The cairns at the site have been designated the North-East Cairn, Central Cairn, and South-West Cairn. It is thought that there were at least two other cairns at the site which are no longer extant. The North-East and South-West Cairns are both passage graves with entrances built leading to a circular center. The Central Cairn completely encloses the circular space inside, and it is thought that bodies may have been cremated here based on finds in the 1950's which uncovered cremated bone and evidence of recurring fires. There is a fourth, poorly preserved, structure at the site known as the Kerb Cairn which, today, is only a circle of stones near to the Central Cairn. The 1950's excavations designated this stone ring a gravesite, though no human remains were uncovered, based on the similarity of construction to the nearby ancient cemetery of Milton of Clava. All three cairns are surrounded by upright, slender, standing stones of slightly different color. While these upright stones bear no symbols, some of the stones which make up the cairns are inscribed with ring-and-cup marks. Examples of the mysterious circles carved in stones have been found all over the United Kingdom and beyond. No one knows what the circles symbolized to the ancient carvers, but it appears the petroglyphs were wrought using stone tools or deer antlers. It is possible   even likely   that the ring-and-cup marks symbolize an unknown tripartite deity or the Triple-Goddess of the Maiden-Matron-Crone who appear in a number of locales throughout the Celtic world. The marks might also suggest the journey through life as symbolized by the spiral which would mirror the construction of the passage graves as a kind of labyrinth. Bradley's Excavations The North-East and South-West passage graves, excavated by Professor Bradley in the 1990's, along with the rest of the site, exemplify these engravings, but whether these were carved into the stones before they were in place or after is unknown. Professor Bradley concluded that the entire site was originally constructed during a single phase, but this only means that the stones and the cairns were erected at once, and it sheds no light on whether the ring-and-cup marks were engraved before or after the stones were set in place. Digs at the site have revealed bone fragments indicating that this site, like others, was most certainly a burial ground. Bradley reports: Love History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! A few flecks of cremated bone were found on the surface of the platform [of the north-east cairn and] over a hundred lithic artifacts were recovered during the excavation and samples were taken for study by soil micromorphology, pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating. (Bradley, 1, Historic Environment Record) It appears, however, that it served as a final resting place for a very select few and was not a cemetery for the common people. No complete skeletal remains have been recovered from the site, and it is probable that only one person was buried in each of the cairns or, perhaps, only a single person at the entire site. The Balnuaran of Clava (Clava Cairns) Dave Conner (CC BY-NC-SA) It has been speculated, based on the amount of quartz found in proximity to the cairns, that they were once adorned with the white stone which would have caused them to almost glow and this suggests the importance of the site to ancient people. Professor Bradley has shown that stone rubble was used to initially help hold the larger stones of the cairns in place and that this rubble then extended outwards toward the eleven monoliths which surround the site. These smaller rocks and gravel, after the stones of the cairns were fully situated, were then spread to form an even platform between the structures and the monoliths so that, taken together with the quartz-covered cairns, the site would have been most impressive. Astronomical Significance Professor Alexander Thom conclusively showed, in the 1940's,, that the entranceways of the passage graves align directly and, in correspondence with the standing stones, point to the winter sun's setting position. The cairns are now all open to the sky and rise to a height of about five feet (1.5 m) but evidence suggests that they were once much higher than the ruins one sees today, probably at least ten feet (3 m) tall, and that the inner chamber of each cairn was enclosed by a roof. On the winter solstice, sunlight beams directly into the chambers of the passage graves, illuminating the rooms which would have been in darkness the rest of the year. Regarding this, Historic Scotland observes: Remove Ads Advertisement The [North-East Cairn] is aligned on the midwinter solstice. In recent years this phenomenon has been observed by covering the chamber and passage with tarpaulin. This showed that on a clear day the rays of the setting sun travel down the passage and divide the chamber in half. A beam of intense light focuses on the back wall. The same effect would have been visible in the south-west cairn where the view is obstructed by a modern farmhouse. (Historic Scotland.gov.uk) The midwinter solstice is recognized as a matter of considerable importance to the ancients as so many early structures are found aligned to it (such as the famous site of Maeshowe in Orkney, Scotland, and Newgrange in Ireland, to name only two). As with more famous locations, the cairns at Clava are situated so precisely that, when considered in a pattern with other sites nearby, an astronomical purpose is very clearly suggested. Scholars John and Julia Keay write: It has been noted that a line through the passages of the two passage graves points exactly to a spot on the horizon corresponding to the midwinter sunset. This is unlikely to be fortuitous, although the significance and meaning of the alignment is a matter of controversy. It also appears that the cairns and their surrounding stone circles are laid out with complex geometrical accuracy, suggesting a knowledge of practical mathematics and astronomy. (165) Clava Cairns Panorama Bettany Weeks (CC BY-NC-ND) The  controversy  the Keays allude to is the interpretation of the site by visitors in the modern day who often conclude, skeptically, that the cairns are simply mounds of stones farmers cleared from their fields and piled in heaps. This interpretation is untenable when one considers the precision with which the cairns are constructed, their astronomical alignment, and the physical evidence of long use of the site as ritually significant. Further, as has been noted, the cairns at Clava form a discernible pattern with other monuments in the area but were constructed on a grander scale, which makes clear that this site was significantly more important than the others. The Keays note: Other cairns of this type in the Inverness area suggest a regional Bronze Age culture which built its burial cairns to a slightly different pattern to other regions of Scotland. The Clava type is very distinctive, although it incorporates the same elements   burial chamber, passages, kerbs   found elsewhere. (165) The distinctive nature of the cairns at Clava no doubt had a specific meaning but what the meaning might be is unknown. It is certain, however, that these cairns   as others throughout Scotland, Ireland, Britain, and elsewhere   were constructed as monuments intimately connected to memory. Memory & the Cairns of Clava From ancient times to the present day, people keep the past alive through remembrance. Ancient Mesopotamian tombs were inscribed with the name and deeds of the deceased just as they were in Egypt, China, Greece, Rome, and elsewhere. In ancient Greece, in fact, the remembrance of the dead ensured their survival in the afterlife, and in Egypt, tomb offerings were made daily for the sustenance of the departed. In China, tomb-sweeping day   in which one visits and tends to the graves of one's relatives   has been observed for centuries and continues to be in the present day. It is probable, then, whatever other uses Clava Cairns served, it was a place of remembrance. The astronomical positioning of the graves and standing stones would not have taken away from the aspect of those structures as memorials either to an individual, a group, an event, or a reminder of the essential nature of life as change and one's eternal journey after death. Scholar Rodney Castleden writes: Long memories are characteristic of Celtic communities. The Druids leaned totally on memory. They had to devote themselves to great efforts of learning. Julius Caesar noted that the Druids  are said to learn by heart a great number of verses.  They went so far as to spurn writing in order to intensify their dependence on memory. In Druidry there is a deep and abiding connection between memory and nature. The earth itself is regarded as remembering everything; it is a witness to history in a way that we cannot fully appreciate. (447) Anyone who has spent any time in Ireland or Scotland is aware of the power and strength of the Celtic memory. Along these lines, the cairns would have served as memorials; although what exactly they were memorializing remains uncertain. The ring-and-cup marks at the site continue to defy efforts at interpretation   as they do elsewhere   but could signify the mystical concept of the Rule of Three in which  multiplying an image was a simple way of emphasizing it  and  the most common way of doing this was to multiply an image by three  (Castleden, 459). Deities are frequently represented in Celtic iconography in three's   as they are elsewhere   but the ring-and-cup marks might also represent individuals or, placed as they are at Clava Cairns, the spiral concept of the labyrinth. Remove Ads Advertisement Panorama of The Balnuaran of Clava Cairns Joshua J. Mark (CC BY) Conclusion Labyrinths, whether in ancient Egypt or Greece, were associated with the dead and one's journey through the afterlife but are also associated with one's life prior to death and one's journey to wholeness. The choices one makes inside a labyrinth either confuse and lead to frustration and loss or strengthen and lead to completion and fulfillment. Castleden observes that  the spiral is the simplest form of labyrinth, one in which no choices are presented beyond the choice to travel. It is a single path, a path to the center and back  (467). The passage graves at Clava Cairns certainly present one with only this one choice and the ring-and-cup marks could have been carved to emphasize the cyclical nature of life so inherent in Celtic mythology and lore. In this view, nothing and no one ever dies; all things merely change and become something else. The seemingly linear path one travels between birth and death does not actually begin at birth or end with death; everything that dies comes back in some renewed form or continues on eternally. The cairns at Clava could have been raised to emphasize this understanding as well as commemorate those who had passed on to the next phase of existence on their eternal journey.",

        "content": "Table of Contents Quick Summary Ask Anything Also important to Sri Lanka s cultural development has been its position as the nexus of important maritime trade routes between Europe , the Middle East , and Asia. Long before the European discovery of an oceanic route to India in the 15th century, Sri Lanka was known to Greek, Roman, Persian, Armenian, Arab, Malay, and Chinese sailors. With the coming of the Europeans, however, the strategic importance of Sri Lanka increased, and Western maritime powers fought to control its shores. Both Sri Lanka and India came under European influence and colonial rule. This common experience worked to tighten the long-standing links between the two countries, and, with the attainment of independence in the mid-20th century, Sri Lankan and Indian social institutions and ideologies began to resonate more closely with each other. Despite its obvious affinities with India, Sri Lanka nevertheless developed a unique identity over the ages that ultimately set it apart from its neighbour. Cultural traits brought from India necessarily underwent independent growth and change in Sri Lanka, owing in part to the island s physical separation from the subcontinent. Buddhism, for instance, virtually disappeared from India, but it continued to flourish in Sri Lanka, particularly among the Sinhalese. Moreover, the Sinhalese language , which grew out of Indo-Aryan dialects from the mainland, eventually became indigenous solely to Sri Lanka and developed its own literary tradition. Sri Lanka has had a continuous record of human settlement for more than two millennia, and its civilization has been shaped largely by that of the Indian subcontinent. The island s two major ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and the Tamils , and its two dominant religions, Buddhism and Hinduism , made their way to the island from India , and Indian influence pervaded such diverse fields as art, architecture, literature, music, medicine, and astronomy. history of Sri Lanka , a survey of the notable events and people in the history of Sri Lanka from ancient times to the present day. The country, formerly known as Ceylon, is an island lying in the Indian Ocean and separated from peninsular India by the Palk Strait . Proximity to the Indian subcontinent has facilitated close cultural interaction between Sri Lanka and India from ancient times. At a crossroads of maritime routes traversing the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has also been exposed to cultural influences from other Asian civilizations. Geologically, Sri Lanka is an extension of peninsular India that separated from the mainland perhaps as recently as the Miocene Epoch (roughly 25 to 5 million years ago). Archaeological excavations undertaken since the late 20th century have indicated that the island already supported human inhabitants some 75,000 to 125,000 years ago. The earliest occupants of the region were, like other Paleolithic peoples, hunters and gatherers who made and used fairly rough stone tools. Finer tools made of quartz and occasionally of chert become visible in the archaeological record about 28,000 years ago. The artifacts from this era, which include many microliths (very small, sharp flakes of stone that can be used individually or hafted together to make a serrated edge), have been found throughout the country, especially among the grasslands of the hills and the sandy tracts of the coast. By about the 9th century bce, people had begun to experiment with food production and irrigation and had gained access to some of the iron tools produced on the continent. Early settlement and the spread of Buddhism Sri Lanka s earliest human inhabitants of whom there is direct fossil evidence were hunter-gatherers in the area of Balangoda in the south. Urban settlements first appeared in the 10th century bce near Anuradhapura in north-central Sri Lanka. The ancestors of the Sinhalese, who were speakers of Indo-Aryan languages, migrated from northern India about the 5th century bce. The Tamils were probably later immigrants from areas of central, eastern, and southern India where Dravidian languages were spoken; their early migrations spanned a period from about the 3rd century bce to about 1200 ce. Sri Lanka possesses a historical tradition preserved in written form by Buddhist chroniclers. The earliest of the extant chronicles is the Dipavamsa ( Island s Chronicle ), compiled probably by Buddhist nuns in the 4th century ce. The Dipavamsa was followed by the Mahavamsa ( Great Chronicle ) and its continuation, called the Culavamsa ( Little Chronicle ). Together, these chronicles constitute a literary record of the establishment and growth of Sinhalese political power and of Sri Lankan Buddhism; however, the documents must be used with caution and always in conjunction with archaeological especially epigraphic material.

Subscribe Legendary origins According to the Sinhalese tradition, as recorded in the Mahavamsa, the first Indian settlers on Sri Lanka were Prince Vijaya and his 700 followers, who landed on the west coast near Puttalam (5th century bce). They had been banished for misconduct from the kingdom of Sinhapura in northern India by Vijaya s father, King Sinhabahu, who put them all in a ship and drove them away. When Vijaya s band landed on the island, it was inhabited by yakshas (a type of spirit; perhaps referring here to human members of a cult of yaksha devotees), whom they defeated and chased into the interior. Vijaya married a yaksha princess and had two children by her. Later he drove her and the children away and sent to the Madurai court in India for a Pandu (probably referring to the Pandya dynasty) princess and for wives for his 700 followers. Vijaya settled down to reign as king after a ceremonial enthronement and marriage and founded a dynasty. He had no heir to the throne, and toward the end of his reign he sent for his younger brother at Sinhapura. The brother, unwilling to leave his native land, sent his youngest son, Panduvasudeva, to Sri Lanka. Panduvasudeva landed with 32 followers at Gokanna (now Trincomalee) on the east coast. He was enthroned at Upatissagama and continued the Vijaya dynasty. Indo-Aryan settlement in Sri Lanka The account of Sri Lanka s settlement as presented in the Mahavamsa contains an element of historical fact the settlers were Indo-Aryan peoples from northern India. However, controversy exists as to the exact provenance of the early settlers; the legends contain evidence pointing to both the northeastern and the northwestern parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Vijaya s ancestors hailed from Bengal, in the northeast, but his father established himself subsequently in Gujarat, the area in northwest India from which the adventurers were put out to sea. Before arriving in Sri Lanka, their ship called at Supara, on the west coast of India. Their landing in Sri Lanka, at Tambapanni, near Puttalam, would indicate their arrival from western India. Some early tribal names occurring in Sri Lanka also suggest connections with northwestern India and the Indus River region. While considerable evidence points to western India as the home of the first immigrants, it seems probable that a subsequent wave arrived from the vicinity of Bengal and Odisha in the northeast. One band of settlers landed in Sri Lanka at the east-coast port of Gokanna, a natural port of disembarkation for vessels arriving from the Bay of Bengal. The traditional accounts of the arrival of Panduvasudeva may portray a second wave of migration following the first mentioned in the Vijaya legend. Linguistic affinities between the early Sinhalese- and Prakrit-speaking peoples of eastern India strengthen the hypothesis of a migration from this area. The tradition speaks primarily of settlement by conquest, and tribes of conquerors led by a warrior nobility would certainly have propelled the Indo-Aryan migration southward. Also important, however, was the pursuit of trade (as opposed to military conquest). Indo-Aryan merchants probably reached Sri Lanka while sailing down the Indian coast, and some of these merchants, motivated by a lucrative trade in Sri Lanka s natural products, may have founded settlements. The view that Indo-Aryan migrants laid the foundations of Sinhalese civilization increasingly has come into question since the late 20th century. Archaeological evidence has indicated that settled agriculture, tank irrigation, use of iron, and pottery were features present before the Indo-Aryan migrations. During the early phases of these migrations, a synthesis seems to have taken place between Indo-Aryan, pre-Indo-Aryan, and possibly Dravidian elements to create the early Sinhalese culture of the Anuradhapura period, which spanned the 3rd century bce to the 10th century ce. The chronicled account of Vijaya s confrontation with the yakshas and the search for consorts in the Pandu kingdom of Madurai (if this may be presumed to be the Pandya Tamil kingdom of southern India) point to such integration. In any case, Indo-Aryan settlements grew in different parts of the island from about the 5th century bce. The settlers came in numerous clans or tribes; the most powerful were the Sinhalese, who eventually gave their name to the descendants of the various groups. The earliest settlers were those on the west-central coast, who pushed inland along the Malwatu River and founded a number of riverbank villages. Their seat of government was Upatissagama. Tradition attributes the founding of the kingdom of Anuradhapura to Pandukkabhaya, the third king of the Vijaya dynasty. With its growth as the strongest Sinhalese kingdom, the city of Anuradhapura and the nearby settlements flourished. Kings built up the city and developed it for urban life as they extended royal control over villages and outlying settlements. With the establishment of strong government, the population grew and the kingdom expanded into the north-central region.",

        "content": "Delhi or Democracy? The Sri Lankan Tamil Dilemma Haunted by History..! -By LeN South Asia Correspondent (Lanka-e-News -04.July.2025, 11.30 PM) Beneath the gentle palm-fringed skyline of Jaffna and the rain-soaked hills of Sri Lanka s tea country, an old question lingers like the morning mist: Why do Tamil politicians still place their faith in New Delhi rather than engage constructively with Colombo? It is a question that ruffles feathers in both capitals   and among the increasingly disillusioned Tamil population of the north and east. For decades, leaders such as M.A. Sumanthiran, a senior Tamil parliamentarian and prominent figure in the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), have looked to India   not Sri Lanka s own institutions   as the saviour of Tamil political aspirations. But with history being what it is, many now ask: Hasn t India already had its say   and its way   with Tamil politics in Sri Lanka? A History Etched in Betrayal To understand today s paradox, one must first revisit the turbulent 1980s. In a move that would permanently reshape Sri Lanka s post-independence history, India   under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi   began training and arming Tamil rebel groups to destabilise Colombo s rule in the north and east. Officially, New Delhi cited its concern for the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Unofficially, the Indian intelligence community viewed Colombo s growing ties with Washington and its flirtation with regional non-alignment as a threat to Indian hegemony in the Indian Ocean. According to former Indian intelligence officials who later spoke on record, the aim was not Tamil liberation   but Tamil leverage.  We didn t want to break Sri Lanka. We wanted to bend it,  said a retired Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) operative during a 2013 academic symposium in Chennai. The results were devastating. Indian-financed militancy fractured the democratic Tamil political movement, radicalised its youth, and transformed grievances into warfare. The armed struggle, led by multiple groups and later dominated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), effectively destroyed the peaceful Tamil federalist movement   and invited catastrophic retaliation. When the Master Turned on the Monster By the late 1980s, India s monster had grown too large to control. The LTTE refused to be a puppet   assassinating rivals, rejecting Indian-imposed settlements, and eventually turning their guns on Indian forces themselves. The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987, signed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J.R. Jayewardene, brought in the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). Ostensibly there to protect Tamil civilians and disarm the rebels, the IPKF ended up embroiled in bitter combat with the LTTE and was accused of extensive civilian atrocities. By the time the IPKF exited in 1990, more than 1,200 Indian soldiers were dead, thousands of Tamil civilians had been killed or maimed, and Sri Lanka s sovereignty had been profoundly violated. Many in the north still speak of the Indian occupation with bitterness   not as peacekeeping, but as punishment. And yet, three decades later, Tamil politicians like Sumanthiran continue to seek Indian support as if 1987 never happened. Sumanthiran and the High Commission Circuit The image is familiar to Colombo s diplomatic watchers: Tamil MPs   mostly from the TNA   making their rounds at the Indian High Commission, attending closed-door meetings, requesting interventions, and issuing statements that echo New Delhi s geopolitical narratives. While such diplomacy is technically within their rights as elected officials, critics see something more troubling   an abdication of local agency.  Why do Tamil leaders still behave as if New Delhi holds the keys to their destiny?  asks Dr. Niranjan Sathasivam, a political science lecturer at the University of Peradeniya.  India has used, discarded, and destroyed the Tamil struggle. It is not a neutral party. And yet, they treat Delhi as both priest and prophet.  Indeed, while the BJP government under Narendra Modi has increased symbolic gestures   cultural exchanges, temple restoration funds, high-level visits   it has offered no serious commitment to constitutional reform, federal devolution, or post-war justice in Sri Lanka. Nor does it appear particularly inclined to do so.  The BJP is not interested in Tamil self-determination. They are interested in countering China and influencing the Sri Lankan political balance,  said a Western diplomat in Colombo. Yet Sumanthiran, a devout Christian, is now seen by some as genuflecting not before his faith, but before Modi s political machinery.  It s as if he s praying to the BJP,  said a Tamil journalist in Jaffna.  He has never once criticised India for their betrayal. Never mentioned the IPKF atrocities. Never acknowledged that India armed our youth only to annihilate them.  Playing the Indian Card   Again Sumanthiran and his allies maintain that Indian involvement remains essential because of Sri Lanka s \"unreliable majoritarianism\". Colombo, they argue, has repeatedly broken promises to the Tamil people   from the aborted Bandaranaike Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 to the stalled 13th Amendment implementation promised under Indian auspices.  We cannot ignore the regional context,  Sumanthiran told local media in April.  India is our closest neighbour and has always played a key role in shaping Sri Lanka s political landscape.  But to many Tamil civil society members, that logic feels outdated   and humiliating.  Do we really want to be begging from the same country that trained child soldiers on our soil and then bombed our villages?  asked a senior activist in Mullaitivu.  Do we have no shame?  Others point to the irony that even today, India publicly insists the solution must come from within Sri Lanka   while Tamil politicians keep flying to Delhi or whispering to Indian envoys in Colombo. The NPP Moment   A Lost Opportunity? In the wake of Sri Lanka s historic economic collapse and the political shift it triggered, the National People s Power (NPP) party   led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake   has emerged as a formidable alternative. The party, with its leftist credentials and anti-corruption stance, has made overtures to Tamil constituencies, offering a new beginning based on equality and decentralisation. Many in the south view the NPP as the first Sinhala-majority party in decades willing to talk seriously about Tamil grievances without racial posturing. Yet, curiously, the Tamil political leadership has remained lukewarm.  They have not even formally sat down with the NPP leadership to explore a framework,  said Prof. Rajan Hoole, a Tamil academic and human rights campaigner.  They are still waiting for Modi.  This hesitation has caused increasing friction with Tamil civil society groups, who are now demanding that the TNA and its allies stop using Indian influence as a shortcut to domestic engagement.  The NPP may not be perfect,  said Rev. Emmanuel Navaratnam, a priest from Kilinochchi.  But they are here. They are willing. They are not the same as the old chauvinist parties. Why are our politicians wasting time in Delhi when they should be in Colombo negotiating real change?  Pawn Politics and Diaspora Discontent For the vast and influential Tamil diaspora   particularly in the UK, Canada, and Australia   this pattern of dependence on India is becoming increasingly unacceptable.  In the 1980s, they asked us to fund the armed struggle. Then we were told to support political engagement. Now they re asking us to trust India again?  said Arun Siva, a Tamil barrister based in London.  We ve been pawns in every geopolitical chess game. Enough is enough.  There is growing pressure within diaspora groups to shift focus back to community rebuilding, economic development, and local political engagement   not proxy games with regional powers. A recent open letter signed by over 70 Tamil professionals worldwide criticised Sri Lankan Tamil MPs for  outsourcing political responsibility to New Delhi  and called for a  homegrown Tamil political movement rooted in accountability and dignity.  The Lasting Damage The costs of this political outsourcing are not abstract. The 30-year war that followed India s meddling cost Sri Lanka trillions in lost economic output, destroyed generations of Tamil youth, and militarised the state in ways that persist to this day. And yet, there has never been a formal Tamil political reckoning with India s role.  There is collective amnesia,  said Dr. Shamara Pathmanathan, a political psychologist.  No memorials for the Tamil civilians killed by the IPKF. No parliamentary resolutions. It s as if Tamil political leaders are afraid to speak the truth about India   lest the patron turns its back.  But increasingly, younger Tamils are asking: Is silence about Indian betrayal a prerequisite for Tamil leadership? The Future: Engagement, Not Submission As Sri Lanka slowly emerges from its post-default fog and grapples with systemic reforms, the question remains: Will Tamil politicians finally turn inward and engage with the country s evolving democratic space, or will they continue to outsource Tamil destiny to a foreign capital that has done more harm than good? There are signs of a generational shift. Grassroots Tamil movements in the north are beginning to bypass party structures. Young leaders are calling for cross-ethnic coalitions, justice for war victims, land rights, and language equality   within the framework of Sri Lanka s evolving political architecture.  We need truth. We need courage,  said 28-year-old activist Yalini Thurairajah, speaking at a recent youth forum in Batticaloa.  And we need leaders who stop asking for favours and start demanding rights   here, not in Delhi.  -By LeN South Asia Correspondent --------------------------- by (2025-07-04 23:18:18) We are unable to continue LeN without your kind donation.

It is also the birthplace of Theravada Buddhism which is the dominant religion in Sri Lanka, including Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. This form of Buddhism is also practiced by minorities in India, China, Bangladesh, Nepal and Vietnam. The ancient capital of Anuradhapura stands at a heritage site located in the cultural triangle, conserved with the support of UNESCO since the 1980s. The Sri Lankan Government is planning to develop Anuradhapura, including Jaffna, and Kandy, as heritage cities. The site is also one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Anuradhapura, 200 kilometres (124 miles) north of capital Colombo, will be visited by PM Modi, who will pay homage to a fig tree believed to have grown from a cutting from the Bodhi tree in India under which the Buddha attained enlightenment more than 2,500 years ago. The tree is worshipped and is a symbol of national sovereignty for the 22 million strong Buddhist population of the country.",

        "title": "Retracing historical and cultural links between Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka",
        "content": "By T. Ramakrishnan The recently consecrated Thiruketheeswaram temple in Mannar in Sri Lanka s Northern Province has come to symbolise close ties between Tamil Nadu and the island nation, thanks to the involvement of the Government College of Architecture and Sculpture, Mamallapuram, in the temple s restoration. Regarded as one of the five important abodes of Lord Shiva in Sri Lanka, the temple, said to have been worshipped by Saivite saint Thirugnanasambandar, was damaged during the protracted civil war that ended in May 2009. It had a fresh lease of life following the Indian government s decision to fund the renovation project and lend its technical expertise. The  mahamandapam  was renovated with the support of the Mamallapuram college and materials, including granites, were procured from Tamil Nadu. While the Indian government provided a grant of LKR 320 million for the restoration, which eventually cost LKR 900 million, the Archaeological Survey of India supervised its execution. Beyond Thirukeetheswaram, the relationship between the two territories can be traced to the proto-historic times. Marks, similar to graffiti inscribed potsherds discovered during early excavations at Adichanallur, Korkai and many other sites of the Early Historic period, were recovered from places such as Tissamaharama, Kantarodai, Manthai and Ridiyagama in Sri Lanka, according to a 2019 publication of the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology on Keeladi. Historians also refer to continuous trade links between the two regions, citing the discoveries in Tamil Nadu of Sinhala Prakrit inscriptions on pottery. In fact, veteran numismatist, art historian and archaeologist of Sri Lanka Osmund Bopearachchi has even recorded in a 2008 paper on ancient Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu that Sinhalese traders were present in Tamil Nadu in the same period when Tamil traders were active at Anuradhapura and Tissamaharama in Sri Lanka. He has also stated that the epigraphic and literary evidence for  the active role played by Tamil merchants in the early phase of Sri Lanka s history is numerous . In a conversation with this newspaper in 2017, Dr. Bopearachchi, former Adjunct Professor of Central and South Asian Art, Archaeology, and Numismatics, University of California, Berkeley, said,  The earliest coins found in Sri Lanka were Pandya and Chera coins.  In K.A. Nilakanta Sastri s seminal work, A History of South India, one can find numerous accounts of battles between rulers of southern India and Sri Lanka. A significant account of them pertains to how Rajendra Chola-I (1012-44 CE) completed the conquest of Sri Lanka begun by his father Rajaraja Chola (985-1016 CE) and Mahinda V s son, Kassapa, became the centre of Sinhalese resistance to the Tamil power. Sri Lanka s prominent historian K.M. de Silva, in his landmark work A History of Sri Lanka, points out that Nayakkars, who belonged to the Vaduga caste,  a Telugu-speaking group originally hailing from Madurai,  established marriage ties with the Kandyan royal family during the 17th century. He adds that the accession of the Nayakkar dynasty to the Kandyan throne in 1739 CE was  accommodated with the minimum of disturbance . On the side of culture and religion, Kataragama in the deep south, once regarded by people in Tamil Nadu as one of the six abodes of Lord Muruga, has shrines for Muruga, Shiva and Deivanai Amman, making any visitor from Tamil Nadu feel at home. Aimed at attracting a larger number of tourists from Tamil Nadu, the Sri Lankan authorities are planning to launch a Muruga trail, apart from the old Ramayana trail. Rajaraja Chola had got people of Sri Lanka involved in the construction of the Brihadeeswara temple in Thanjavur, says M. Rajendran, former Vice-Chancellor of Tamil University. G.P.V. Somaratna, former Head of Department of History and Political Science, University of Colombo, in his paper  Tamil Buddhism in Sri Lanka , states that the presence of Buddhism in ancient Tamil Nadu had a  great impact  on Buddhist activities in Sri Lanka and the northern part of the island in particular. Since the classical period, there have been significant contributions from literary personalities belonging to Sri Lanka s Tamils to Tamil literature. Tamil scholar of yesteryear Mu. Varadarajan, in his work on the history of Tamil literature ( Tamil Illakkiya Varalaru), records that Eezhathu Poothanthevanar, a poet from Sri Lanka, had composed seven verses of the Sangam anthology. Ayathurai Santhan, an award-winning Sri Lankan Tamil writer, notes that one of the Tamil classics, Manimekalai, refers to an islet, Manipallavam, which has been identified with the present Nainativu of Sri Lanka. Dr. Rajendran observes that the Pathni cult, the worship of Kannaki, had spread to Sri Lanka from Tamil Nadu. Prominent scholars Arumuga Navalar (1822-1889) and C.V. Damodaram Pillai (1832-1901) had strong connections with Chennai. Tiruppur Krishnan, editor of Amudhasurabhi, refers to Vipulananda Adigal (1892-1947), who was known not only for his work in the expansion of activities of Ramakrishna Mission in Sri Lanka but also for his contribution to Tamil literature. He recalls how veteran writer-editors such as Ki. Va. Jagannathan (1906-88) and Naa. Parthasarathy (1932-87) made it a point to visit Sri Lanka regularly for mobilising subscriptions for their journals, Kalaimagal and Deepam. Mr. Santhan is of the view that K. Kailasapathy, Karthigesu Sivathamby, Dominic Jeeva and Se. Ganesalingan were among those who left behind a huge impact on the Tamil literary field. In recent years, the social relationship between people of Sri Lanka and those of India in general, Tamil Nadu in particular, has only grown due to a variety of reasons. Be it the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom or the present spell of economic crisis, sections of Sri Lankan society have found in Tamil Nadu a safe haven. But, given the historical, cultural and sociological factors, there are deeper reasons for the peoples of the two lands to be closer than what they have been. (The Hindu)",

        "title": "Sri Lankan Newsrooms In The 1950s: Before The Advent Of The Internet, Phones, And Smartphones",
        "content": "The 1950s are considered the  golden age  of Sri Lankan journalism, producing many giants such as Denzil Peiris, Mervyn de Silva, Tarzie Vittachi, Ira Amarasekera, and Piyasena Nissanka. At the time, there were only two main news publishers in the country the Times group and the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited, better known as the  Lake House . Both these companies were privately owned and had large audiences because newspapers and radios were the only methods of communications during that era. The Times group published two main newspapers the Times of Ceylon and the Lankadeepa, while the Lake House published the Daily News, Dinamina, Thinakaran, and the Sunday Observer. The journalists produced in Sri Lanka at that time were considered to be on par with their contemporaries abroad, despite working under conditions very different to our own: news publishers of the 1950s were not exposed to the advent of mobile phones, the internet, and smartphones, and news was gathered and produced in ways very different from now. Dress code Even the way a journalist dressed in the 1950s was very different to the way they dressed now, veteran editor Edmund Ranasinghe told Roar Media. Today, journalists mostly dress in casual clothing an untucked shirt with pants or jeans, for instance but the journalist of the 1950s was expected to wear a shirt and a tie. Coats were also mandatory if setting out for an assignment, as was a hat a dictum probably influenced by the British. One thing in particular that stood out then, from the way things are done now, is the manner in which relationships with  sources  are cultivated, Edmund Ranasinghe told Roar Media. Back in the day, journalists actively cultivated relationships with politicians, ministers, departments heads, and other officers of import, and maintained close links with them to preserve their sources of news. As there were no messaging or emailing platforms, it was important that the journalist kept in touch with decision makers and other people directly affecting his  beat . It was common for journalists to make appointments with politicians, ministers, departments heads, and other people in the morning hours, during which meeting, information was gathered. Deadlines for article submissions were at 1.pm, Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa, Sri Lanka s oldest active journalist told Roar Media. Journalists who went out into the  field  were expected to type out their articles and submit them to their respective News Editors before 1.pm. Whatever research was necessary for the article must also be accrued by these journalists through means far more difficult than the click away we are accustomed to; there was no internet, with its wealth of information, nor yet browsers like Google to make search easier. Instead, journalists had to pore through books and clippings at public and private libraries to find what they were looking for, and laboriously take down that information by pen before painstakingly crafting their  story  for news publications. The newspaper publishers (that is to say, the Times group and the  Lake House ) both had extensive libraries which were liberally used by the journalists in the 1950s and thereafter. Library staff maintained dossiers on notable figures of authority both in Sri Lanka and abroad, for easy access. The dossiers contained paper cutting with important information regarding people of national and international importance, and journalists were wont to sift through them to find a particular article in which a statement or action taken by a leader was documented. It was also necessary for the newsman of yore to be well-read and possess a deep knowledge of current local and international affairs. While in modern times information is only a few clicks away, the journalist from the 1950s was expected to be on his/her toes, able to engage in deep conversation on matters of national and international importance at any given time. D.F. Kariyakarawana, a former Editor at Lake House for the Janatha and Silumina papers, who worked at the Times Group and Lake House as a journalist in the 1950s wrote in his memoirs Memories of Seven Decades,  Editors back in the day thought a good English knowledge was essential even for a Sinhala language journalist going out on coverage. The same applied to photographers working with Sinhala newspapers. For instance, I remember three Burgher photographers who worked for Dinamina (a Sinhala daily newspaper) namely Don Pascal, Harvey Campbell, and Neil Moses. Even the cartoonist of the Dinamina newspaper in the 1950s was a Burgher by the name of Mark Gerrain. He could hardly write in Sinhala, although he was attached to a Sinhala paper.  International news International news was gathered by means of a teleprinter, which was connected to the Reuters newswire service, Edmund Ranasinghe told Roar Media. The machine would unceasingly print out news of international importance which was gathered by the International News Editor who earmarked the more important ones for the next day s newspaper print. This was not an easy task and an International News Editor often had a team of journalists below him to help. The newsrooms were male-dominated, Edmund Ranasinghe admits. He did say, however, that there were a few women who worked in newsrooms, mainly in the function of Sub-Editors or Features editors a feature present even today. Because newsrooms jobs or jobs as reporters were not considered female-friendly, it deterred many women from taking up jobs in the newsrooms. However, two notable female journalists emerged from that era Roshan Peiris and Ranji Handy. The kickback on smoking indoors had not taken place yet, Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa said, guiltily admitting he had been a chain smoker when he was younger, to the extent he had a lit cigarette in his hand, even while having lunch.  Till I developed a cough,  he said.  After which the doctor told me,  Young man, you will be dead before you turn 30 if you continue this way , and I quit the habit from that point on.  That didn t stop the other writers and editors from smoking both pipes and cigarettes, however, as smoking continued unabated in the newsrooms. Often, by the time lunch was over, a sizable proportion of the newsroom was already  in the cups . It appears that this did not affect their work because some of the finest journalists Sri Lanka produced were from that era. Fraternity Because the two main newspaper publishers were based in the Fort area, journalists from the rival papers often fraternized with each other at the cafes and restaurants on Chatham Street, Hospital Lane, at the Nippon Hotel, at the Lord Nelson, and the National Bar. It was customary for reporters to hang out at these restaurants and bars after work or during the day. It was here that many interesting stories were exchanged over a drink and ideas part of a journalistic lifestyle. D.F. Kariyakarawana writes in his memoirs,  During my days at the Times group, it was almost a daily ritual to go to Ratnagiri, after work (Ratnagiri is a hotel and bar located opposite to the WTC building at Echelons Square, Colombo Fort). Neville Dillamort, Chief Sub Editor of Times of Ceylon, and Ervin Moonamalai, the Chief Reporter of the paper, also joined us. Almost a half of my monthly salary was spent on Ratnagiri. Aside from drinks, our lunch was also bought from Ratnagiri.  This tradition appears to be perpetuated even by modern journalists, who often visit the Ratnagiri and other smaller bars in the Fort area to fraternize with each other over stories. Although the way stories are gathered, crafted and published has changed so much with the advent of the internet and web publishing, there are many aspects of the newsroom that remain unchanged. The passion a journalist has for pursuing a story, the idea that newspapers can create change, can chronicle events for posterity, continues to live strong in the mind of aspirants. Journalism is not easy, nor yet a popular career for many, but for those who choose it, it is a literary life. Cover: The landmark  Lake House  building, that still stands today.

        "title": "Overview of the Sri Lankan Civil War",
        "content": "Key Takeaways The Sri Lankan Civil War started because of ethnic tensions between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities. The British colonial rule aggravated tensions by favoring Tamils, creating resentment among the Sinhalese majority. The war ended in 2009 with a government victory after a long and bloody conflict. In the late 20th century, the island nation of Sri Lanka tore itself apart in a brutal civil war. At the most basic level, the conflict arose from the ethnic tension between Sinhalese and Tamil citizens. In reality, though, the causes were much more complex and arose in large part because of Sri Lanka's colonial history. Background Great Britain ruled Sri Lanka then called Ceylon from 1815 to 1948. When the British arrived, the country was dominated by Sinhalese speakers whose ancestors likely arrived on the island from India in the 500s BCE. Sri Lankan people seem to have been in contact with Tamil speakers from southern India since at least the second century BCE, but migrations of significant numbers of Tamils to the island appear to have taken place later, between the seventh and 11th centuries CE. In 1815, the population of Ceylon numbered about three million predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese and 300,000 mostly Hindu Tamils. The British established huge cash crop plantations on the island, first of coffee, and later of rubber and tea. Colonial officials brought in approximately a million Tamil speakers from India to work as plantation laborers. The British also established schools in the northern, Tamil-majority part of the colony, and preferentially appointed Tamils to bureaucratic positions, angering the Sinhalese majority. This was a common divide-and-rule tactic in European colonies that had troubling results in the post-colonial era in places such as Rwanda and Sudan. Civil War Erupts The British granted Ceylon independence in 1948. The Sinhalese majority immediately began to pass laws that discriminated against Tamils, particularly the Indian Tamils brought to the island by the British. They made Sinhalese the official language, driving Tamils out of the civil service. The Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948 effectively barred Indian Tamils from holding citizenship, making stateless people out of some 700,000. This was not remedied until 2003, and anger over such measures fueled the bloody rioting that broke out repeatedly in the following years. After decades of increasing ethnic tension, the war began as a low-level insurgency in July 1983. Ethnic riots broke out in Colombo and other cities. Tamil Tiger insurgents killed 13 army soldiers, prompting violent reprisals against Tamil civilians by their Sinhalese neighbors across the country. Between 2,500 and 3,000 Tamils likely died, and many thousands more fled to Tamil-majority regions. The Tamil Tigers declared the \"First Eelam War\" (1983-87) with the aim of creating a separate Tamil state in northern Sri Lanka called Eelam. Much of the fighting was directed initially at other Tamil factions; the Tigers massacred their opponents and consolidated power over the separatist movement by 1986. At the outbreak of the war, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India offered to mediate a settlement. However, the Sri Lankan government distrusted her motivations, and it was later shown that her government was arming and training Tamil guerrillas in camps in southern India. Relations between the Sri Lankan government and India deteriorated, as Sri Lankan coast guards seized Indian fishing boats to search for weapons. Over the next few years, violence escalated as the Tamil insurgents used car bombs, suitcase bombs, and landmines against Sinhalese military and civilian targets. The quickly-expanding Sri Lankan army responded by rounding up Tamil youths and torturing and disappearing them. India Intervenes In 1987, India's Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, decided to directly intervene in the Sri Lankan Civil War by sending peacekeepers. India was concerned about separatism in its own Tamil region, Tamil Nadu, as well as a potential flood of refugees from Sri Lanka. The peacekeepers' mission was to disarm militants on both sides, in preparation for peace talks. The Indian peacekeeping force of 100,000 troops not only was unable to quell the conflict, it actually began fighting with the Tamil Tigers. The Tigers refused to disarm, sent female bombers and child soldiers to attack the Indians, and relations escalated into running skirmishes between the peacekeeping troops and the Tamil guerrillas. In May 1990, Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa forced India to recall its peacekeepers; 1,200 Indian soldiers had died battling the insurgents. The following year, a female Tamil suicide bomber named Thenmozhi Rajaratnam assassinated Rajiv Gandhi at an election rally. President Premadasa would die in a similar attack in May 1993. Second Eelam War After the peacekeepers withdrew, the Sri Lankan Civil War entered an even bloodier phase, which the Tamil Tigers named the Second Eelam War. It began when the Tigers seized between 600 and 700 Sinhalese police officers in the Eastern Province on June 11, 1990, in an effort to weaken government control there. The police laid down their weapons and surrendered to the militants after the Tigers promised no harm would come to them. However, the militants took the policemen into the jungle, forced them to kneel, and shot them all dead, one by one. A week later, the Sri Lankan Minister of Defense announced, \"From now on, it is all out war.\" The government cut off all shipments of medicine and food to the Tamil stronghold on the Jaffna peninsula and initiated an intensive aerial bombardment. The Tigers responded with massacres of hundreds of Sinhalese and Muslim villagers. Muslim self-defense units and government troops conducted tit-for-tat massacres in Tamil villages. The government also massacred Sinhalese school children in Sooriyakanda and buried the bodies in a mass grave, because the town was a base for the Sinhala splinter group known as the JVP. In July 1991, 5,000 Tamil Tigers surrounded the government's army base at Elephant Pass, laying siege to it for a month. The pass is a bottleneck leading to the Jaffna Peninsula, a key strategic point in the region. Some 10,000 government troops raised the siege after four weeks, but over 2,000 fighters on both sides had been killed, making this the bloodiest battle in the entire civil war. Although they held this chokepoint, government troops could not capture Jaffna itself despite repeated assaults in 1992-93. Third Eelam War January 1995 saw the Tamil Tigers sign a peace agreement with the new government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga. However, three months later the Tigers planted explosives on two Sri Lankan naval gunboats, destroying the ships and the peace accord. The government responded by declaring a \"war for peace,\" in which Air Force jets pounded civilian sites and refugee camps on the Jaffna Peninsula, while ground troops perpetrated a number of massacres against civilians in Tampalakamam, Kumarapuram, and elsewhere. By December 1995, the peninsula was under government control for the first time since the war began. Some 350,000 Tamil refugees and the Tiger guerrillas fled inland to the sparsely populated Vanni region of the Northern Province. The Tamil Tigers responded to the loss of Jaffna in July 1996 by launching an eight-day assault on the town of Mullaitivu, which was protected by 1,400 government troops. Despite air support from the Sri Lankan Air Force, the government position was overrun by the 4,000-strong guerrilla army in a decisive Tiger victory. More than 1,200 of the government soldiers were killed, including about 200 who were doused with gasoline and burned alive after they surrendered; the Tigers lost 332 troops. Another aspect of the war took place simultaneously in the capital of Colombo and other southern cities, where Tiger suicide bombers struck repeatedly in the late 1990s. They hit the Central Bank in Colombo, the Sri Lankan World Trade Centre, and the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, a shrine housing a relic of the Buddha himself. A suicide bomber tried to assassinate President Chandrika Kumaratunga in December 1999 she survived but lost her right eye. In April 2000, the Tigers retook Elephant Pass but were unable to recover the city of Jaffna. Norway began trying to negotiate a settlement, as war-weary Sri Lankans of all ethnic groups looked for a way to end the interminable conflict. The Tamil Tigers declared a unilateral ceasefire in December 2000, leading to hope that the civil war was truly winding down. However, in April 2001, the Tigers rescinded the ceasefire and pushed north on the Jaffna Peninsula once more. A July 2001 Tiger suicide attack on the Bandaranaike International Airport destroyed eight military jets and four airliners, sending Sri Lanka's tourism industry into a tailspin. Long Road to Peace The September 11 attacks in the United States and the subsequent War on Terror made it more difficult for the Tamil Tigers to get overseas funding and support. The United States also began to offer direct aid to the Sri Lankan government, despite its terrible human rights record over the course of the civil war. Public weariness with the fighting led to President Kumaratunga's party losing control of parliament and the election of a new, pro-peace government. Throughout 2002 and 2003, the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers negotiated various ceasefires and signed a Memorandum of Understanding, again mediated by the Norwegians. The two sides compromised with a federal solution, rather than the Tamils' demand for a two-state solution or the government's insistence on a unitary state. Air and ground traffic resumed between Jaffna and the rest of Sri Lanka. However, on October 31, 2003, the Tigers declared themselves in full control of the north and east regions of the country, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency. Within just over a year, monitors from Norway recorded 300 infractions of the ceasefire by the army and 3,000 by the Tamil Tigers. When the Indian Ocean Tsunami hit Sri Lanka on December 26, 2004, it killed 35,000 people and sparked another disagreement between the Tigers and the government over how to distribute aid in Tiger-held areas. On August 12, 2005, the Tamil Tigers lost much of their remaining cachet with the international community when one of their snipers killed Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a highly respected ethnic Tamil who was critical of Tiger tactics. Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran warned that his guerrillas would go on the offensive once more in 2006 if the government failed to implement the peace plan. Fighting erupted again, including the bombing of civilian targets such as packed commuter trains and buses in Colombo. The government also began assassinating pro-Tiger journalists and politicians. Massacres against civilians on both sides left thousands dead over the next few years, including 17 charity workers from France's \"Action Against Hunger,\" who were shot down in their office. On September 4, 2006, the army drove the Tamil Tigers from the key coastal city of Sampur. The Tigers retaliated by bombing a naval convoy, killing more than 100 sailors who were on shore leave. After October 2006 peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, did not produce results, the Sri Lankan government launched a massive offensive in eastern and northern parts of the islands to crush the Tamil Tigers once and for all. The 2007-2009 eastern and northern offensives were extremely bloody, with tens of thousands of civilians caught between the army and Tiger lines. Entire villages were left depopulated and ruined in what a U.N. spokesman termed \"a bloodbath.\" As the government troops closed in on the last rebel strongholds, some Tigers blew themselves up. Others were summarily executed by the soldiers after they surrendered, and these war crimes were captured on video. On May 16, 2009, the Sri Lankan government declared victory over the Tamil Tigers. The following day, an official Tiger website conceded that \"This battle has reached its bitter end.\" People in Sri Lanka and around the world expressed relief that the devastating conflict had finally ended after 26 years, hideous atrocities on both sides, and some 100,000 deaths. The only question remaining is whether the perpetrators of those atrocities will face trials for their crimes.",

        "title": "Imperfect Choices: A History of the Sri Lankan Economic Crisis",
        "content": "In March 2022, Sri Lanka experienced widespread unrest as a result of the government s failure to contain the historically significant economic crisis. Now that the dust has settled, we can more clearly grasp and analyse the events and causes leading up to the crisis. In this article, Ananay Agarwal examines the economic causes of the problem, along with the most recent agreement between the IMF and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka formally went into default on its debt obligations in April 2022, which marks the official time-period when the situation went from imminent crisis to present crisis. The default immediately resulted in runaway inflation and a shortage of essential supplies like fuel, paper, and food. Shortly thereafter, the Sri Lankan public, frustrated with its political leaders, besieged the President s Mansion in Colombo, leading to iconic images of crowds in the presidential swimming pool. This public outcry and anger forced President Rajapaksa to relinquish his office and paved the way for Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to win the Presidency. As the economy gradually began to improve under Wickremesinghe, the most violent of protests had largely subsided by November 2022. As of writing, a path to resolve the situation and move the country forward has been constructed, and the path is being travelled upon, but the future is still uncertain. Building up to the Economic Crisis: The Post Civil-War Boom When Sri Lanka s civil war came to an end in 2009, the country s economy saw a substantial post-war boom. The economy started to show signs of life as the country s infrastructure was renewed and security was strengthened. This boom, though, turned out be just temporary, and the growth could did not continue for more than three years. The graph below shows that by 2012, the GDP growth rate had dropped significantly, from over 8% to roughly 4% and never fully recovered to the highs of the early 2010s. A small political elite emerged in the years following the civil war, controlling the economy and steering the nation away from pro-growth policies and toward personal gain. Foreign investments had dried up as a result of the conflict, and the new regulations established substantial trade hurdles for foreign corporations to invest in the nation as well as competitive barriers for new domestic firms to emerge without major political backing. Furthermore, with the Great Recession in full swing, prices for Sri Lanka s two main exports   tea and rubber   saw a sharp drop in value, further depressing the post-war boom. White Elephants The term  white elephant  is used to describe a large-scale public investment project that is expensive to create and maintain, but does not produce sufficient economic returns or advantages to justify its cost. In the 2010s, Sri Lanka ended up opting for several such projects with funding from Chinese Banks. These include: 1. Hambantota Port: Located in southern Sri Lanka and funded by Chinese loans, the port was intended to act as a trans-shipment hub before the Malacca Strait. However, the project ballooned in cost, and the Sri Lankan government eventually handed control of the port to China on a 99 year lease. There were also several accusations of corruption, and many Sri Lankans even wondered if the port was ever required in the first place. 2. Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport: Also funded by Chinese banks, this Airport was opened in 2013 and intended to act as a second international airport to serve the capital city of Colombo. Initially many airlines did opt to use it, including Sri Lankan Airlines, but by 2018 all airlines had left. It was even dubbed the  World s Emptiest International Airport  by Forbes magazine due to its low number of passengers and flights, and comparatively gargantuan size. 3. Lotus Tower: The tower is a 350 metres tall telecommunications tower, and has been criticised for its exorbitantly high cost and allegations of scams. Moreover, its location has also been questioned, with broadcasters saying that the tower neither covers all of Sri Lanka, nor improved the quality of current transmissions. 4. Lakvijaya Power Station: Sri Lanka s largest power plant and accounting for nearly 15% of its tower power supply, the station has faced several breakdowns since its inception in 2011. It has been alleged that the government agreed to use sub-standard materials in its agreement, which might be responsible for its frequent failures. 2019 Easter Bombing Over 250 people were killed in a string of Easter-related bombings in three churches and three hotels in Colombo in April 2019. Aside from the horrific loss of life and destruction of property, tourism   one of the main drivers of Sri Lanka s GDP   immediately took a hit. Between 2018 and 2019, spending by international tourists decreased by 16.85%, and between 2019 and 2020, spending decreased by an extraordinary 76.92%. The below graph from MacroTrends shows very clearly that International Tourist spending   which in the 2010s was accounting for 20% of Sri Lankan exports   plummeted in 2019. The decline in tourist arrivals also negatively impacted other sectors of the economy reliant on it like hospitality and transportation. The worst hit were self-employed individuals. Business that had hitherto been operating even during the worst phase of the Civil War were forced to shutter as tourists stayed away. GDP actually declined by 0.2% in 2019, owing chiefly to the Easter Bombings and subsequent Covid outbreak later in the year. Covid-19 Outbreak The outbreak of Covid-19 was an epoch defining event, and the world struggled to overcome it, with Sri Lanka being no exception. However, with an economy heavily reliant on tourists and the export of tea and rubber, the island nation s economy faced an even bleaker time. In conjunction with the Easter Bombings, tourism completely dried up. Hundreds of businesses in Sri Lanka that cater to tourists were forced to shut down as the world went into lockdown and international travel ceased to exist. Additionally, as demand for its main exports declined, so did their prices, which negatively impacted its balance of payments. On the other hand, remittances from Sri Lankans living overseas decreased as more people lost their jobs globally. The pandemic also compelled the government to increase its budgetary expenditure and keep the economy from going down an even darker path. However, the incumbent Rajapaksa government had already slashed taxes in 2019 as a poll-promise, and this policy came back to bite them. The combination of falling revenues and rising spending caused the fiscal deficit to balloon to more than 10% in 2020. In hindsight, this was the first canary in the coal mine that Sri Lanka is in trouble. Overnight Switch to Organic Farming The final nail in the coffin was an almost overnight switch to organic farming. In a bid to address its balance of payments crisis, President Rajapaksa was advised that if the country stopped using imported chemical fertilisers, the import bill would fall and subsequently reduce pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The President began to position himself as an environmental champion and his country a haven for organic farming, and consequently banned   in one fell swoop   all chemical fertilisers from May 2021. Many environmental organisations applauded his decision and praised him as an example to be followed. However, this policy had an extremely detrimental outcome. Farmers were left completely unprepared for the ensuing decline in soil productivity, having little to no notice to prepare them. Food scarcity resulted from the nation s agricultural output falling to an all-time low and consequently, inflation shot through the roof. Ironically, this compelled the nation to import more food, undermining the very rationale behind this policy. In the end, a measure taken to alleviate pressure on forex reserves had the opposite effect and harmed them the most, serving as the proximate cause of the subsequent economic crisis. Historic Dealings with the IMF The International Monetary Fund and Sri Lanka have had extensive dealings since the mid-1960s. In the past 56-year period, approximately 33 years have been spent under the macro-economic management of the IMF, as shown by the graph below. It is to be noted that the IMF fully distributed the agreed funds under 12 of these 16 agreements, with Sri Lanka failing to meet the conditions for the full disbursement of the remainder. The relationship between Sri Lanka and the IMF is multi-faceted and complex, and one should be careful to not attach simplistic  good  or  bad  narratives to both actors. The IMF, with its heavy ideological baggage of adhering to the Washington Consensus, did not always take into account the unique position of Sri Lanka s geography or its institutions. Similarly, Sri Lankan politicians have always been quick to cast the IMF as a neo-colonialist entity and refused to implement policies that are unpopular in the short-term but beneficial for its long-term macro-economic stability. Regardless of the narrative, the fact however is that the Sri Lankan economy has been running on a periodic cycle fuelled by unsustainable debt for decades. The debt is used to finance fiscal and current account deficits, an economic upturn occurs, and politicians kick the proverbial problem down the road to the future generation. Invariably, when the global economy coughs and debts are called in, Sri Lanka catches a cold. The country has unfortunately followed a pattern where it sets out onto the path of fiscal reform to stabilise its economic system, but then reverses direction and fall back into crisis. The 2023 IMF deal On March 20, 2023, the IMF and Sri Lanka signed an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreement to help bring the country out of its economic quagmire. The 48-month arrangement will infuse capital into the country s coffers and allow it to pay for necessary imports like food and fuel. This should give enough policy room to the government led by President Wickremesinghe, to implement structural changes in the economy. The President has also stated the EFF should help increase confidence in the country s economy and allow the government to access another 7 billion USD in funding from other multilateral and international creditors. The IMF immediately released 0.333 billion USD in funds, with more expected to be released in the following months. What is an EFF? The EFF, or Extended Fund Facility is one of IMF s several financial assistance programs, with others being the Stand-By-Arrangement (SBA) and Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI). The choice of program the IMF chooses to utilise depends on the specific needs and problems of the country in question. The EFF is designed to support countries that are facing a balance of payments crisis. It is aimed at helping countries implement long-term structural reforms in their economy so that underlying macro-economic difficulties can be addressed. Under this program, the country in question receives financial assistance in the form of loans or credits for three to four years from the IMF, but with several strings attached. The recipient country is typically required to pass reforms that are aimed at restoring macro-economic stability, reducing fiscal deficits, improving tax collections, reduce government expenditure, and increase productivity and efficiency of state institutions. The official IMF statement has identified four key areas in which reforms are to be implemented   Tax Administration, Public Financial and Expenditure Management, Energy Pricing, and Anti-Corruption Legislation. Tax Administration The last three IMF programs, in addition to the new one in 2023, have primarily focused on addressing the low tax collections of the Sri Lankan government. In December 2019, the government slashed indirect taxes like Value-Added-Taxes (VAT) from 15% to 8%, and the corporate income tax rate from 28% to 24% as poll promises. In addition, other taxes like the nation-building tax of 2%, the Economic Service Charge and PAYE, were also abolished. As a result, Sri Lanka had one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP ratios in 2021. Total tax revenues fell by over 520 million LKR between 2019 and 2020, i.e. nearly 30%. On the flip side, Covid-19 and the Organic Farming fiasco caused an increase in government expenditure by nearly 550 million LKR. This included things like Covid relief assistance through the State Ministry and recruitment of 160,000 unskilled an unemployed graduates. Together, the budget deficit rose by over 100% between 2019 and 2020. The IMF has strongly urged Sri Lanka to implement  progressive  taxes, i.e. charging more tax from the rich, instead of  regressive  taxes, i.e. charging more tax from the poor. Indirect taxes are strongly regressive in nature, since they are taxes paid on the consumption of goods and services. Hence, regardless of income, consumers pay the same tax, implying that poorer people end up spending a greater portion of their income on indirect taxes than wealthier individuals. By adopting more progressive taxes, Sri Lanka should ideally shift away from its heavy reliance on indirect taxes (over 80%) to more sustainable sources of tax income. Public Financial and Expenditure Management The IMF has effectively asked the Sri Lankan government to  tighten its belt  so to speak. It should spend only within its means and cut down on its deficit. A big part of this involves restructuring its external debt obligations from other multilateral and international creditors. This might be in direct reference to the several white elephant projects the country has invested in, many of which have been more hassle than benefit. Sri Lanka needs to consider its long-term finances and act judiciously instead of impulsively funding projects without considering its costs and benefits. Energy Pricing Sri Lanka is significantly dependent on fuel imports from abroad because the country does not possess a significant endowment of hydrocarbons. As a result, supply and demand dynamics on the commodity markets determine energy prices in Sri Lanka. With the Russian-Ukraine war, the cost of coal and oil increased, and Sri Lanka had to pay more to maintain its fuel supply. In order to maintain fuel imports and the island s supply of electricity, the Sri Lankan government started using up its foreign exchange reserves of USD at an unsustainable rate to continue buying fuel in the international market. Eventually, this was no longer feasible, and a decline in resource imports brought about national fuel rationing and electrical shortages. This fuel rationing and electrical shortages made it clear that Sri Lanka and its citizens were at the mercy of uncertain international energy markets. Since the country imports nearly two-thirds of its fuel, the IMF wants Sri Lanka to diversify its energy sector away from hydrocarbons. Shifting to green and renewable sources of energy like wind, solar, or tidal will ensure a more stable supply of electricity to the country and also decrease the pressure on its foreign exchange reserves. Anti-Corruption Legislation The IMF has praised the ongoing efforts of the country in tackling corruption, and asked that they continue and ultimately culminate in revamping anti-corruption legislation. The IMF will also continue conducting the governance diagnostic mission that will assess Sri Lanka s anti-corruption and governance framework. Such governance diagnostic studies have recently been conducted by the IMF in Moldova, the Republic of Congo, Mauritania, and Zambia. The reports on the Republic of Congo, Zambia, Moldova, and Mauritania are all available online. The IMF believes that these analyses are instruments that nations may employ to build strong governance structures and strengthen the rule of law. In all four nations, the IMF teams examined the central bank s governance, the financial and fiscal sectors, the protection of property and contract rights, the tax system, and anti-money laundering systems. It seems clear that the diagnostic framework on Sri Lanka will look at the same items given the press briefing released by the IMF. The diagnostic framework however has been heavily criticised due its strong ideological tinge in neoliberal economics, and been called a propaganda tool to legitimise austerity. The fact that the Sri Lankan government has currently authorized the sale of a number of profitable State-Owned Companies is particularly pertinent to notice. This choice has most likely been made under pressure from the IMF that believes that governments shouldn t become involved in business. Regardless, the authorisation of these sales encouraged strikes by labour unions and in turn triggered the outlawing of strikes by the government. Conclusion With the benefit of hindsight, it is not unreasonable to say that the current crisis is a repeat of a historical pattern that has regularly played out in Sri Lanka. This time however, the crisis has been particularly acute and there is a very real chance that Sri Lanka can veer off its debt fuelled trajectory. The way forward for Sri Lanka lies in making imperfect policy choices. Firstly, significant hikes in taxation, particularly indirect taxes like VAT, will disproportionately affect the poor and less well-off, at a time when they are already facing the brunt of the crisis. However, high tax collections is one of the conditions that the IMF has imposed, and indeed greater revenue will certainly create a healthier economy in the longer term. Secondly, the government must also spend only within its means, but this will certainly reduce the societal benefits it provides to its citizens. It is thus unclear how Sri Lanka will accomplish the IMF s simultaneous demands for  expenditure management  and an increase in social benefits. Thirdly, diversifying away from hydrocarbons to green energy might sound good on paper, but has the potential to make Sri Lanka even more reliant on weather patterns and the monsoons, since these will then directly affect its energy production. Lastly, while corruption is a menace in Sri Lankan society and certainly needs to be combatted, there is a case to be made that the IMF is no moral superman, and its diagnostic framework a tool to legitimise its authority and ideology. The most likely conclusion is that Sri Lanka recovers from the crisis  better than before,  with the likelihood of the two extremes reverting to previous behaviours or becoming a wholly different Sri Lanka being far lower.

        "title": "The Sri Lankan Civil War and Its History, Revisited in 2020",
        "content": "On June 9, 2020, Sri Lankans occupied the streets outside the US Embassy in Sri Lanka s capital, Colombo, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, holding signs condemning the racism, police brutality, and other maladies plaguing the United States. Sri Lanka s social issues also came to light at this protest. The country, after all, has its history of ethnic strife and is currently mending after the end of a long, brutal civil war. As the nation attempts to heal, Sri Lanka continues to sustain new injuries to its social and political structures that reveal much larger systemic problems. Police arrived at the demonstration and violently dispersed protesters arresting at least 53 individuals supposedly to enforce public health restrictions related to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the police s ferocity was unsettling. Some footage, for instance,  showed a young woman being tossed into a police vehicle, head first.  One of the protest s organizers, Pubudu Jayagoda, indicated that the Sri Lankan government had been  downplaying coronavirus health risks,  implying that the police perhaps had ulterior motives and revealing his disillusionment with the government s policing power. Such growing disenchantment with the Sri Lankan government represents just one problem amongst the country's history of ethnic tensions. Sri Lanka s present is haunted by memories of the island s decades-long civil war, which began in 1983 and ended just over 10 years ago. The war was mainly a clash between the Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) insurgent group, the latter of which had hoped to establish a separate state for the Tamil minority. The mainstream narrative suggests that the civil war was derived from tensions between the Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic groups. However, the war also represented the legacy of British imperialism. This alternative analysis suggests that the ethnic conflicts were symptoms of a much larger problem, rejecting the oversimplified narrative that Sri Lanka is home to a people that are perpetually clashing with one another due to ethnic incompatibilities. Instead, the analysis surrounding the legacy of British imperialism embraces the idea that Sri Lanka s conflict has much to do with each group fighting to reclaim its dignity and power, albeit at the expense of the other. A post-colonial analysis reveals that both the Sinhalese and Tamils acted to recover what they believed they had lost during their respective golden eras, imperial rule for the Sinhalese and shortly after for the Tamils. Present moments like the June 9th protest are no longer surprising and clearly align with Sri Lanka s broader history under this interpretation. Perhaps more importantly, this post-colonial narrative suggests that Sri Lanka s conflicts are not in the past; rather, the conflicts continue to manifest through the government s leadership in moments much like the Colombo protests. An Origin Story Sri Lanka is 74.9 percent Sinhalese and 11.2 percent Sri Lankan Tamil. Within these two groups, Sinhalese tend to be Buddhist and Tamils tend to be Hindu, displaying significant linguistic and religious divisions. However, the strife between the grounds purportedly began much further back in Sri Lanka s ancient settlement history. Though the Sinhalese people s arrival in Sri Lanka is somewhat ambiguous, historians believe that the Tamils arrived on the island both as invaders and traders from India s Chola Kingdom. These origin stories suggest that the Sinhalese and Tamil communities have experienced tension from the very beginning not out of cultural incompatibility, but rather out of power disputes. During British imperial rule, the tensions between the two groups worsened. The CIA suggested in 1985 that the Sinhalese community felt threatened by the Tamil group s prosperity partly due to the British favoritism of Tamils during the British occupation of Sri Lanka. Because Tamil communities also existed in several other British colonies like India, South Africa, and Singapore, Sri Lankan Tamils benefited from broader commercial networks and a wider range of opportunities. Moreover, British colonial authorities often placed English language schools in predominantly Tamil areas, providing Tamils with more civil service and professional opportunities than their Sinhalese counterparts. This pattern of Tamil favoritism left Sinhalese people feeling isolated and oppressed. Despite the tension between these groups before British colonization, the events that followed Sri Lankan independence suggest that imperial rule had provoked the ensuing conflict. Indeed, soon after British occupiers left the island in 1948, these patterns of Tamil dominance changed dramatically. The Story Reverses After British independence, many Sinhalese worked their way into the upper echelons of government. These Sinhalese gained power and went on to gradually pass acts effectively disenfranchising their Tamil counterparts. One such act was the Sinhala Only Act, a 1956 bill that made Sinhala the only official language of Sri Lanka and created barriers for Tamil people trying to access government services or seeking public employment. Former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga frames the act, which her father passed, as a move to nurture and reclaim a Sri Lankan identity following an extended period of British rule. If Kumaratunga s statements about her father s legislation are sincere and accurate, her commentary may reveal that legislators at the time hoped to recover the dignity of their Sinhalese ethnicity that they felt was lost during British imperial rule not that they wanted to actively minimize Tamil culture. Retrospectively, though, the minimization of Tamil culture is precisely what the laws accomplished. Another pertinent policy was that of standardization, which aimed to provide more educational opportunities for disadvantaged Sinhalese students. The policy required Tamil students to achieve higher exam scores that their Sinhalese counterparts in order to be admitted Sri Lankan universities. Legislators created a program that resembled affirmative action for the Sinhalese, who lacked opportunities and were disadvantaged during British imperial rule. Yet, when coupled with the Sinhala Only Act, standardization took opportunities from Tamil students, several of whom had turned to educational avenues to compensate for their lack of professional civil service opportunities. Thus, this legislation passed by a Sinhalese-dominated government failed to level the playing field; instead, it tilted the odds in the other direction and effectively discriminated against Tamil students. Ostensibly, these ethnic frictions had roots in the social destabilization caused by British occupation, and had more to do with reclaiming Sinhalese power and dignity than to cultural tensions between the Tamils and Sinhalese. Even so, before long, a few militant Sri Lankan Tamils organized an insurgency. The War Itself Some Tamils responded to these discriminatory policies with the idea of Tamil Eelam, a separate state for Tamils. While the idea appears to be extreme, the two groups already lived in somewhat separate spheres of the country: the Sinhalese in Southern, Western, and Central Sri Lanka, and the Tamils in the Northern and Eastern parts of the island. Tamil Eelam aimed to formalize this existing geographic separation. The movement was built on the idea that Tamils and Sinhalese represented distinct ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. However, post-colonial thought would suggest that the underlying reasons for both Sinhalese and Tamil actions in the immediate post-colonial period were not due to untenable differences, but rather a desire for power across the country s communities and a feeling of frustration about the lack of opportunity caused by factors beyond the groups  control. Nonetheless, Tamils had mixed reactions to the concept of Eelam. While a handful of groups supported Tamil Eelam, only one prevailed: the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). LTTE destroyed other budding Eelam groups like the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) to become the  sole representative of the Tamils.  The conflict then escalated into civil war. The war officially began after a day of riots targeting Tamils in Colombo in July 1983, a month which has since been dubbed  Black July.  The fighting lasted just under three decades and ended in May 2009, when the Sri Lankan government announced that they killed the LTTE leader. LTTE was an uncompromising group inspired by Che Guevarra and his guerilla warfare tactics. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) soon labeled the LTTE a terrorist group after they initiated terror tactics including suicide bombers, the suicide belt, and female-led suicide attacks. The group even assassinated two world leaders: Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Indeed, the LTTE s activities extended beyond Sri Lanka s borders. However, LTTE was not the only perpetrator of heinous crimes during the Sri Lankan Civil War. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights determined that the Sinhalese-dominated government has also been implicated in war crimes such as the torture of war prisoners and citizen disappearances. In one notably brutal example, the government s forces murdered five Tamil students in the port city of Trincomalee. These conflicts, rooted in a quest for power and dignity, descended into brutal violence on both sides, and memories of this violence still haunt the country today. The Situation Now and the Protests Revisited Although the Civil War ended in 2009, the current situation in Sri Lanka has only partially improved. A large portion of the Tamil population remains displaced. While there are fewer political and civil rights issues, instances of torture and enforced disappearances persist even in recent years. Moreover, the Sri Lankan government often surveils and tracks people linked to LTTE. The Sri Lankan military still occupies predominantly Tamil areas designated as  high-security zones,  though to a lesser extent than during the war. The government s Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) targets mostly Tamils. In a more subtle sense, the Sri Lankan government continues to disenfranchise the Tamil community. Through the process of  Sinhalization,  for instance, Sinhalese culture has slowly replaced that of the Tamil population. Sinahlese monuments, road signs, street and village names, as well as Buddhist places of worship became more common in predominantly Tamil areas. These efforts have infringed upon, and in some cases even erased, the Tamil perspective on Sri Lankan history, as well as Tamil and Hindu elements of the country s culture. Photo by Agnieszka Kowalczyk / Unsplash Perhaps the conflict has devolved into an ethnic issue, but it did not start that way. It may not stay that way either. The Sri Lankan government has alienated the Tamil minority since the civil war ended, but, more recently, it has come to disappoint its Sinhalese constituency as well. The government's actions since the end of the civil war have become increasingly undemocratic for Tamils and Sinhalese alike. Its response to the Black Lives Matter protests, for example, was only the latest instance in which the government exercised an unprecedented amount of power. The Sri Lankan government began growing its power during the civil war a conflict that stemmed from ethnic tensions rooted in the legacy of British imperialism on the island. The government continues to expand its authority now many years later. What this means for the future of Sri Lanka is unclear. Still, one thing is for sure: even if the wounds caused by the Sri Lankan Civil War and its accompanying ethnic divisions heal, the country will remain haunted by much larger structural issues in its history and government. However, a unified citizenry in Sri Lanka could be a powerful tool in responding to its government s growing power. Ethnic unity on the island may be the key to a more secure future.",

        "title": "Forty years since the beginning of civil war in Sri Lanka",
        "content": "Forty years ago, in the last days of July 1983, Sinhala chauvinist thugs backed by the United National Party (UNP) government and security forces unleashed a pogrom against Tamils in Colombo and other areas of Sri Lanka. It triggered the 26-year communal war by successive governments against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Burned out Tamil businesses in the Pettha area of downtown Colombo, Sri Lanka on Aug. 1, 1983. More than 1,000 businesses and homes of Tamil's were destroyed in the racial riots. [AP Photo/JLR] The war took hundreds of thousands of lives Tamil, Sinhala and Muslim and devastated the living conditions of many more, mainly of the Tamil minority in the north and east of the island. The conflict came to a bloody end in May 2009 with the military crushing of the LTTE and the slaughter of tens of thousands of Tamil civilians. The protracted civil war contains important strategic lessons for the working class in Sri Lanka and internationally. Though the war ended 14 years ago, the political issues that led to the conflict have not been resolved and continue to fester. The carnage carried out against Tamils 40 years ago was triggered by the death of 13 Sri Lankan soldiers who were killed by the LTTE in an ambush on July 23, 1983. With the approval of the government, the military brought the bodies to Colombo the same day, furnishing the pretext for the anti-Tamil violence. Well-organised thugs armed with guns, explosives, axes, knives and sticks, and provided with electoral lists, targeted Tamil homes and businesses. The gangs acted with the full backing of the UNP government of President J.R. Jayawardene. Some ministers were implicated in organising and directing the attacks. The armed forces and police either participated directly in the violence, or turned a blind eye. Officially, the number killed was 300, but the real figure is at least a thousand. Hundreds of Tamil women were raped. More than 250,000 people were displaced. In Colombo s Welikada jail, 52 Tamil prisoners were massacred with the connivance of prison officials. Thousands of homes and shops owned by Tamils were burned and destroyed. President Jayawardene appeared on national TV on July 28 and justified the communal pogroms.  Because of the violence by the terrorists, the Sinhalese people themselves have reacted,  Jayawardene stated. He declared that the government had decided to proscribe organisations advocating the division of the country, adding that  this is the only way to appease the natural desire and request of the Sinhala people.  On August 4, the government enacted the sixth constitutional amendment banning political parties that did not take an oath of allegiance to the  unitary state  from entering parliament or local government bodies. Every state employee was ordered to take a similar oath on pain of dismissal. The North and East were formally declared war zones and  strategies for military operations  in these provinces were drawn up and initiated by army commander Major General Tissa Weeratunga. The 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom did not come out of the blue. Confronted with widespread opposition among workers to its open market policies, the Jayawardene government resorted to the reactionary stock-in-trade of the Colombo political establishment the whipping up of anti-Tamil chauvinism and violence to divide the working class. Sri Lanka was one of the first countries in the world to end the policy of national economic regulation and import substitution and adopt a free market program. Amid a deep economic crisis, the Jayawardene government that came to power in 1977 devalued the rupee and began to shut down or privatise state-owned enterprises, slash spending on essential social services and cut back price subsidies on basic food items such as rice and flour. The consequences for workers and the urban and rural poor were devastating and provoked a growing number of strikes and protests. In July 1980, public sector workers launched a general strike, demanding a 300-rupee wage hike, to which the government responded by sacking 100,000 employees. The strike was ultimately crushed after the main working-class parties the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), the Stalinist Communist Party (CP) and the centrist Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP) refused to wage a political struggle to bring down the UNP government. To counter the widespread opposition, Jayawardene escalated the anti-Tamil campaign that had already led to violent attacks throughout the island, including on Tamil workers in the plantation districts. More than 100 had been killed and nearly 100,000 had been forced to flee their homes. In June 1981, thugs mobilised from Colombo, with the support of security forces and the police, went on a rampage in the northern town of Jaffna, setting fire to the Jaffna Public Library, which had stored valuable books, including irreplaceable manuscripts. Then came the July 1983 pogrom and the war. The Jayawardene government s resort to anti-Tamil chauvinism can be traced to the foundations of the Sri Lankan state, formed after formal independence from British colonial rule in 1948. The ruling class had faced the development of class struggles in the final years of British rule following World War II, particularly by plantation workers, including general strikes in 1946 and 1947. One of the first actions of the UNP government that took power in 1948 was to abolish the citizenship and voting rights of hundreds of thousands of Tamil workers brought from India as indentured labour to work in the plantations. The aim was to divide the working class on ethnic lines and weaken it. However, the Trotskyists of the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India (BLPI), the Ceylonese section of the Fourth International, which had played a leading role in the general strikes, opposed the Citizenship Act and fought tenaciously for the unity of the working class. Colvin R de Silva [Photo: Wikipedia] In the parliamentary debate, BLPI leader Colvin R de Silva condemned the dangerous fascistic principle on which the Act was based, namely  that the state must be coeval with the nation and the nation with the race.  He warned that though the Tamils in the North and East had not been targeted by the Act, it was  not only a short but easy step,  once the racialist principle was adopted as the basis for the Sri Lankan state. The warning was rapidly confirmed. In 1953, the UNP government was brought to its knees by a profound economic and political crisis that had provoked a nation-wide hartal strikes and business closures that united working people across communal lines. The response of the ruling class was to turn to the newly formed Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), which came to power in 1956 on the basis of an openly Sinhala-chauvinist program dressed up with socialistic phrase-mongering. The SLFP-led government implemented its policy of making Sinhala the country s only official language, severely disadvantaging Tamils, including many public servants who lost their jobs. The roots of the civil war that erupted in 1983 lie not simply in the anti-Tamil chauvinism in which the Colombo ruling class is mired, but in the liquidation of the BLPI into the centrist LSSP in 1950 and the LSSP s subsequent political backsliding and adaptation to Sinhala populism and the SLFP. In 1964, the LSSP completely abandoned any adherence to socialist internationalism and joined the bourgeois SLFP-led government of Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike. The LSSP s great betrayal was aided and abetted by the revisionist tendency within the Fourth International led by Michel Pablo and Ernest Mandel that rejected the revolutionary role of the working class and sought to subordinate it to the Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, social democratic parties and bourgeois nationalist forces like the SLFP in countries such as Sri Lanka. The International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) was formed in 1953 in a break from the Pabloites to defend genuine Trotskyism. The LSSP s betrayal generated great confusion and disorientation within the working class. It opened the door for various petty-bourgeois radical groups based on communal politics. In the south, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was formed in 1966 on an eclectic mixture of Maoism, Castroism and Sinhala populism and gained a base among oppressed rural youth. In 1972, the SLFP-LSSP-CP coalition government brought in a new constitution, drawn up by attorney-general and LSSP leader Colvin R de Silva, that formally enshrined Buddhism as the state religion, along with the Sinhala-only language policy. It also enacted discriminatory measures against Tamils in public sector employment and for university entrance. Tamil youth in the north deserted the traditional Tamil bourgeois parties in droves and embraced various Tamil groups including the LTTE that advocated the armed struggle for a separate Tamil state. A group of youth who had opposed the LSSP s betrayal formed the Revolutionary Communist League (RCL), the predecessor of the Socialist Equality Party, in 1968, as the Sri Lankan section of the ICFI. RCL General Secretary Keerthi Balasuriya addressing an RCL meeting in early 1970. Tragically, Comrade Balasuriya died in 1987 at the age of just 39. The RCL alone championed the program of socialist internationalism, opposed all forms of communal politics and fought for the unity of the working class Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim. When conflict finally erupted in 1983, the RCL was the only party that consistently opposed the war, defended the democratic rights of Tamils and demanded the unconditional withdrawal of the Sri Lankan army from the North and East. The 26-year war is an indictment against the Sri Lankan ruling class and a confirmation of Leon Trotsky s Theory of Permanent Revolution. Trotsky demonstrated that the bourgeoisie in countries of belated capitalist development are organically incapable of meeting the democratic and social aspirations of the masses. That task falls to the working class as part of the struggle for a workers  and peasants  government to implement socialist politics and the fight for socialism internationally. The war also graphically exposed the LTTE s separatist policy that sought to carve out a separate state of Eelam in the North and East of the island with the support of India. Despite its various socialistic phrases, the LTTE s call for a separate state represented the interests of the Tamil bourgeoisie that sought an arena to profiteer from the exploitation of Tamil workers. The LTTE s promotion of illusions in the Indian bourgeoisie was exposed in July 1987 when the Indian government reached an agreement the Indo-Lanka Accord to bail out the crisis-ridden Jayawardene regime. The LTTE backed the Accord under which India sent  peace-keeping  troops into northern Sri Lanka to disarm Tamil armed groups on the promise of limited provincial autonomy. The Accord allowed Jayawardene to send his army to crush the rural unrest in the south. The LTTE s support for the Accord reflected deeper processes internationally that were undermining so-called national liberation movements. The globalisation of production in the 1980s had undermined all programs based on national economic regulation, most clearly revealed in the collapse of the Stalinist regimes in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The LTTE increasingly dropped its socialist window dressing and anti-imperialist rhetoric and turned to the major powers to assist in setting up a separate state where foreign capital could exploit cheap Tamil labour. As part of the broader discussion in the ICFI, the RCL, which had advocated the  right of self-determination for the Tamil people,  as a means of unifying Tamil and Sinhala workers, concluded that the slogan no longer had any progressive content. While continuing to demand the immediate withdrawal of Sri Lankan armed forces from the North and East, our party advanced the call for a Sri Lanka-Eelam Socialist Republic as part of a Union of Socialist Republics in South Asia and internationally. While the communal war dragged on until 2009, the LTTE s separatist perspective resulted in its increasing isolation. It blamed the Sinhala masses for the crimes of the Sri Lankan military and attacked innocent Sinhalese people, which only strengthened the hand of the Colombo government. In the North and East, the LTTE increasingly alienated Tamil working people through its oppressive and anti-democratic rule. The LTTE s defeat was not just a military catastrophe but demonstrated the bankruptcy of its political program. As the Sri Lankan military closed in for the kill, the LTTE was incapable of appealing to the working class in Sri Lanka, let alone India and internationally, for support. Instead, it continued to issue futile appeals to the  international community that is, to major powers such as the US and India which had been backing Colombo s war politically and militarily. None of the issues of the protracted civil war have been resolved. The Sri Lankan army maintains its heavy-handed occupation of the North and East, the basic democratic rights of Tamils continue to be trampled on, and, amid an unprecedented economic crisis, communal tensions are again being whipped up. The government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe is implementing harsh austerity measures dictated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It is facing widespread opposition and unrest among workers and the rural masses Sinhala and Tamil alike. In a desperate attempt to stabilise his government, Wickremesinghe is seeking the support of bourgeois Tamil parliamentary parties by offering greater power-sharing for provincial councils. Anti-Tamil communalism has immediately raised its ugly head in Colombo. Sinhala chauvinist groups have already launched a campaign denouncing Wickremesinghe for preparing to divide the country by giving more power to the Tamils. In early August, the former army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Jagath Dias, addressed a Sinhala chauvinist gathering at a Buddhist centre in Colombo, where he claimed that  a plan is underway to help establish Eelam by constitutional means.  The Island, which reported the meeting and is notorious for boosting Sinhala chauvinist groups, declared that Dias would spearhead a campaign against greater provincial autonomy. Another Sinhala extremist group, the National Freedom Front, has accused Wickremesinghe of seeking the  Indianisation of the country  through its economic agreements with New Delhi. Sagara Kariyawasam, secretary of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), on which Wickremesinghe relies for parliamentary support, has warned the president against prioritising discussions on more powers to provincial councils. The whole history of Sri Lanka, particularly the brutal civil war that devastated the island, constitutes a sharp warning to the working class that its class interests for decent, well-paid jobs, social services and living conditions cannot be met through divisive communal politics. Instead, what is desperately needed is a unified struggle of workers, mobilising the downtrodden rural toilers, against the capitalist system and all its defenders, including the trade unions. The Socialist Equality Party calls on workers to form their own democratically elected action committees, independent of all capitalist parties, in every workplace and rural area to fight for their basic democratic and social rights. We are campaigning for a Democratic and Socialist Congress of Workers and Rural Masses based on the representatives of the action committees to take up the fight for a workers  and peasants  government to abolish all forms of communal discrimination, repressive laws and to implement socialist policies.",
