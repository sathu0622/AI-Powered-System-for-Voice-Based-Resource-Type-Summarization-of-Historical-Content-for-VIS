        "content": "Perhaps the most informative and convenient way to get around is on the new double decker City Sightseeing bus, launched in February 2013, which delivers historical commentary as it travels the streets of downtown Jo burg and beyond. Make sure to stop off at Constitution Hill: today, this is the site of the South African Constitutional Court, but visitors will also learn about a rather less cheery era in the country s history. Its Old Fort is a former prison that operated from pre-Boer War times in the late 19th Century and throughout the apartheid era until its closure in 1987. Mandela spent short stints here in 1956 and 1962 while awaiting trial, and although the cells he occupied have since been demolished, a recreated one contains a permanent exhibition documenting his stay both here and on Cape Town s Robben Island, largely through correspondence written during his incarceration. The one-time prison also offers a chilling look at the apartheid regime, where deep racial inequalities permeated even the penal system. The sightseeing bus then takes you on an equally emotional ride to the excellent Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg South, where the exhibition is as superbly moving as it is distressing. Understanding the political system that ruled South Africa from 1948 to 1994 is essential to understanding Mandela himself, and a couple of hours spent walking through recent history will help untangle the extent of the complex web of laws that segregated every aspect of South African society. Throughout the 1950s and  60s, Mandela s home was a simple dwelling on Vilakazi Street in Soweto, a thriving suburb 30km southwest of Johannesburg   though his underground political activities meant that he spent little time here with wife Winnie and their two daughters. Today, the house is preserved as a museum, and while the information panels go a long way to explaining this era in Mandela s life, it is the impassioned guided tours that make this a must-see stop. In those final years before his lengthy incarceration (1962 to 1990), Mandela also spent time in a farmhouse 28km to the north of the city. In the 1960s, Liliesleaf Farm was the headquarters of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the then-banned ANC. Today it has been transformed into a magnificent museum, where interactive exhibits draw visitors into a fascinating chapter in South African history. Information is abundant, so be sure to set aside half a day to fully appreciate the role that Liliesleaf played in the resistance movement. Cape Town and around: Imprisonment and freedom (1964 to 1990) After the Rivonia Trial, which began with the Liliesleaf raid in 1963 and wrapped up in 1964, in which 10 leaders of the ANC were tried for acts of sabotage designed to overthrow the apartheid system, Mandela was moved to Robben Island, South Africa s answer to Alcatraz. Lying 7km off Cape Town s coast, the island served as a jail, a leper colony and a World War II fortification before returning to its roots in 1961 as a maximum security prison with virtually no chance of escape. Today the building is a museum, and it s is one of the main attractions in a city awash with activities and sights. Board a ferry at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront for the half day trip that takes in the choppy seas, tours the island and makes an all-important stop at the cell that held prisoner 46664 for much of his 27 years behind bars. Towards the end of his incarceration, Mandela was moved between prisons in the Cape. Both Pollsmoor Prison and Drakenstein Correctional Centre (formerly Victor Verster Prison) remain in use, and the latter, 70km east of Cape Town in the Winelands, is worth a visit. It is here that Mandela spent his final days of imprisonment and where the memorable scenes of him walking free for the first time in almost three decades were shot. A bronze statue of the great man, hand raised in triumph, commemorates the moment. If you re lucky, you might find a warden to take you on a quick unofficial tour of the cottage where he spent his final years of captivity. Back in Cape Town, there is one more sight to see: the Edwardian City Hall facade overlooking Grand Parade. This large square is home to a daily bustling market, but on 11 February 1990, thousands gathered in this spot to hear Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela speak from the balcony as a free man for the first time in more than 27 years. Visit on a Sunday when the square is quieter and ponder the life of a man who epitomised forgiveness and reconciliation, and inspired not only a nation, but the rest of the world as well.",

        "content": "It is the art crime of the 20th Century. Forty-four years after its theft, what do experts think happened to the Italian painter s masterwork? Alastair Sooke investigates. In the autumn of 1608, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, the most original Italian painter of the 17th Century, was on the run. Tempestuous and arrogant, Caravaggio was forever getting into brawls. He swaggered about with a sword at his side and once flung a plate of scalding artichokes in the face of a waiter, supposedly because some of them were cooked in butter rather than oil. Yet even by his own combustible standards two years earlier he had crossed a line, when he killed a man in a quarrel over a gambling debt at a tennis match. Before he could be charged with murder, he fled Rome and spent the rest of his short life as a fugitive from justice. That autumn in 1608, following spells in Naples and Malta, he arrived in Sicily. He stayed on the island for around a year, sleeping fitfully with a dagger by his side, and painting several late masterpieces, including the Nativity with San Lorenzo and San Francesco.",

        "content": "Perhaps the most intact example of prior rule is the Kastro, a castle on Spiridonos street in Chora, the island s tiny modern-day capital. Built between the 12th and 13th Centuries during a period of Venetian occupation, the castle was once called  the eye of Crete ; views from the top allow visitors to see the Ionian, Aegean and Cretan seas simultaneously. Today, the castle   the former residence of the Venetian governor   houses the historical archives of Cythera. Also in sight is the town of Kapsali, which served as the capital s port during Venetian times. Located just 2km south of Chora, Kapsali is characterised by a curved waterfront and sandy twin bays where sea turtles are known to swim. Kapsali is just one of many villages that dot Cythera s shoreline, with one of the most well known among locals being picturesque Avlemonas, a charming and historic hamlet situated some 18km northeast of Chora that you can reach by crossing Katouni Bridge. A reminder of British rule, the stone bridge  the largest of its kind in Greece at 110m long and 6m wide   was completed in 1826 as part of a project to ensure ease of travel between the seaside village and Chora   or so official records say. Legend has it that the construction was driven by desire: after Cythera s British governor fell in love with a girl from a nearby village, he decided to build this bridge near her house in order to see her daily. Another large relic backed by lore is the Panagia Myrtidiotissa monastery, the largest in Cythera. Situated on the western side of the island near the village of Kalokerines, the monastery   which translates to  The Most Holy Virgin Mary of the Myrtle Trees    was built next to a myrtle tree where a shepherd, according to legend, found a holy icon of the Virgin Mary in the 14th Century. Pilgrims travel here to venerate the icon on 15 August s Feast of the Dormition and on 24 September, the day of its finding. The icon is the patron saint of all Kytherians and is on display in the monastery save for Easter, when there is a religious procession to transfer it to Chora. An island for nature lovers Whittled away by wind and sea, Cythera is generously composed of steep, rocky cliffs and deep bays   and all of these elements are on display in the lush village of Mylopotamos, situated approximately 13km northwest of Chora. Meaning  mill on the river  in Greek, the village was once home to 22 watermills used for grinding wheat. Today, only one renovated mill remains, situated near the island s notorious 20m waterfall, Neraida, which is a fount of folklore. Also known as Fonissa ( female killer ), the waterfall was reputedly the site of a murder: legend has it that two women were fighting atop the waterfall when one pushed the other over the edge. Many hiking paths originate by the Neraida waterfall and loop through the village, incorporating a variety of cultural and scenic elements that illustrate Cythera s combination of natural beauty and historical significance. Hikers can follow one such monopati (a one-person path often used for donkeys)   recently signposted with numbers and arrows   that loops 2.6km past ruins of old mills and back to the town, though the more intrepid can choose to break away from the path before it loops back up and descend 2.2km down steep rocks and through the gorge to Kalami Beach, which can only be reached on foot by climbing down the rocks or through the gorge. Another scenic hike starts in the cypress forests of Lourantianika, in the island s southern region, and passes 4.6km through wild olive trees while affording spectacular views of Chora, the Kastro and the sea. Such discoveries of isolated beauty remain standard on Cythera, said Fivos Tsaravopoulos, programme coordinator of the Kythera Hiking Project, an organization centred around the creation of trails and sustainable tourism on the island.  Cythera is a small paradise for walking,  he said.  It combines incredible landscapes   forests, waterfalls, cliffs, gorges, beaches and a Mediterranean desert   and picturesque villages, beautiful churches on the top of mountains and an incredible amount of wildflowers.",

        "content": "Absinthe has inspired many great authors of the last 150 years   and may have ruined some as well. Jane Ciabattari investigates the green spirit s peculiar power. Arthur Rimbaud called absinthe the  sagebrush of the glaciers  because a key ingredient, the bitter-tasting herb Artemisia absinthium or wormwood, is plentiful in the icy Val-de-Travers region of Switzerland. That is where the legendary aromatic drink that came to symbolise decadence was invented in the late 18th Century. It s hard to overstate absinthe s cultural impact   or imagine a contemporary equivalent. The spirit was a muse extraordinaire from 1859, when  douard Manet s The Absinthe Drinker shocked the annual Salon de Paris, to 1914, when Pablo Picasso created his painted bronze sculpture, The Glass of Absinthe. During the Belle  poque, the Green Fairy   nicknamed after its distinctive colour   was the drink of choice for so many writers and artists in Paris that five o clock was known as the Green Hour, a happy hour when cafes filled with drinkers sitting with glasses of the verdant liquor. Absinthe solidified or destroyed friendships, and created visions and dream-like states that filtered into artistic work. It shaped Symbolism, Surrealism, Modernism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and Cubism. Dozens of artists took as their subjects absinthe drinkers and the ritual paraphernalia: a glass, slotted spoon, sugar cubes   sugar softened the bitter bite of cheaper brands   and fountains dripping cold water to dilute the liquor. Absinthe was, at its conception, not unlike other medicinal herbal preparations (vermouth, the German word for wormwood, among them). Its licorice flavor derived from fennel and anise. But this was an aperitif capable of creating blackouts, pass-outs, hallucinations and bizarre behaviour. Contemporary analysis indicates that the chemical thujone in wormwood was present in such minute quantities in properly distilled absinthe as to cause little psychoactive effect. It s more likely that the damage was done by severe alcohol poisoning from drinking twelve to twenty shots a day. Still, the mystique remains. Muse in a bottle",

        "content": "After 700 years, Lalibela s 11 Unesco-listed churches may be meeting their greatest foe: travellers. After the 1991 fall of dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam made Ethiopia more amenable to visitors, hardy tourists started to make their way to the remote town of Lalibela, perched in Ethiopia s Lasta mountains at 2,600m. The town is home to 11 medieval rock-cut churches so revered, Unesco included them on the original World Heritage list in 1978   a list of then only 12 sites, which now has grown to 981. Yet as more travellers have followed, some are starting to worry that increased commercialisation is eroding the area s unique atmosphere. According to local history, Lalibela s churches were the grand project of early 13th-century King Lalibela, although archaeologists believe that some of the churches, including the imposing Bet Gebriel-Rafael and the nearby Bet Mercurios, were built five centuries earlier, under the rule of the Axumite Empire. Arguably the most spectacular of Lalibela s churches is Bet Giyorgis (St George). The church lies in a hole some 15m deep, putting its cruciform roof roughly at ground level. Giyorgis has no bricks, no blocks, no evidence of joins. Instead, the church is carved out of a single solid piece of pink rock. The 13th-century labourers who built it dug down into an outcrop, carving a trench around a single massive block, and then hewed the church from that monolith. Visiting the church may be a priceless experience, especially in mid-January during Timkat (Epiphany), when thousands of Ethiopian white-clad worshippers, as well as tourists, descend on the churches. But tourists have been grumbling since the fee to see the churches tripled in 2013 from 350 birr to 950 birr, a ticket that covers all 11 churches and is good for four days.  It was a shocker,  said Priscilla Champaneri, who was visiting from New Zealand.  I was thinking it would be $20 (385 birr) maximum. We were backpacking and had accounted carefully for the whole trip. We had paid so much to go there. Our hotel manager said we are not the first to be shocked.",

        "title": "Does Sigmund Freud still matter?",
        "content": "Psychoanalytic theory has changed a lot in the 75 years since his death, but literature still feels the strong influence of Freud's ideas, argues Jane Ciabattari. Freudian slips. The Oedipus complex. The ego. The id. The superego. Sigmund Freud s writings changed how we perceive human behaviour. The founder of psychoanalysis pioneered insights into perhaps the original unreliable narrator   the self   and opened the pathway toward increasingly complex literary characters with motives beyond the obvious.  Every dream will reveal itself as a psychological structure, full of significance, and one which may be assigned to a specific place in the psychic activities of the waking state,  Freud wrote in his landmark book, The Interpretation of Dreams, published in 1899. From the beginning, his work was intertwined with the canonical literature of his time. He drew upon Sophocles, Goethe s Faust and Shakespeare   especially Hamlet, King Lear and Macbeth   to explicate his understanding of unconscious motivations and the complex metaphors and displacements of dreams. He used the language of poets and novelists to outline irrational behaviour, pioneering concepts we have come to think of as commonplace. To begin to understand Freud s enduring impact on literature today, it is illuminating to trace the parallels between his writings and the work of his literary contemporaries. Peer pressure and praise  When I read one of your beautiful works I keep finding, behind the fiction, the same propositions, interests and solutions that are familiar to me from my own thoughts,  Freud wrote to Arthur Schnitzler, whose sexually explicit work, including the 1897 play Reigen (best known as La Ronde) was banned in Austria for nearly a quarter century. Schnitzler was, like Freud, trained as a neurologist in Vienna. And he was familiar with The Interpretation of Dreams. Schnitzler s fiction includes dreams, Freudian symbols (mountains, lakes) and stream-of-consciousness, modelled on the  free association  Freud describes in Studies on Hysteria (1895). Freud also corresponded with Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig, who noted in his 1931 biographical essay about the psychoanalyst,  Twenty years ago, Freud s ideas were still thought of as blasphemous and heretical. Today they circulate freely and find expression in ordinary linguistic usage.  Freud s psychoanalytic theories and emphasis on the unconscious have shaped decades of conflicted characters. His theory of the Oedipus complex underpins many a literary work, from the incestuous relationship between Paul Morel and his mother in DH Lawrence s 1913 novel Sons and Lovers to the present. Freud s work with traumatised World War I soldiers led to Beyond the Pleasure Principle, which fed into the character of Septimus Smith in Virginia Woolf s Mrs Dalloway (1925). The modernist poet HD sought out Freud in 1933 when she was suffering from writer s block, triggered in part by her dread of another devastating world war. Her 1956 book, Tribute to Freud, is a memoir of her psychoanalytic treatment. Critical analysis Freud s theories also have inspired literary critics for more than a century. In the 1940s, Lionel Trilling noted the  poetic quality  of Freud s principles, which, he wrote, descended from  classic tragic realism  a view which does not narrow and simplify the human world for the artist, but, on the contrary, opens and complicates it . Postmodernism, Structuralism and Post-Structuralism   including the work of French theorists Claude Levi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Julia Kristeva   all have roots in Freud s thinking. Susan Sontag argued against Freud and for an  erotics of art  in her 1964 essay Against Interpretation. Harold Bloom applied Freud s Oedipus complex to rivalries among poets and their precursors in his The Anxiety of Influence (1973), an approach given a feminist slant by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in Forward into the Past: The Complex Female Affiliation Complex (1985). Peter Brooks mined Freud s dream-work for ideas of how novels are plotted in Reading for the Plot (1992). Freud s influence continues in the 21st Century. But today he is as likely to turn up as a character as a theoretical catalyst. Recently we ve seen postmodern feminist novels such as the European Union Award-winning Freud s Sister by Goce Smilevski, translated from the Macedonian by Christina E Kramer (2012). This novel fictionalises the melancholy tale of Freud s youngest sister Adolfina, who perished in the Theresienstadt concentration camp (four of Freud s five younger sisters died in the Nazi death camps). Karen Mack and Jennifer Kaufman s historical romance Freud s Mistress (2013) spins a tale out of Freud s alleged affair with Minna, his wife Martha s younger sister. The producers of Downton Abbey have a TV series in the works called Freud: The Secret Casebook, set in fin de si cle Vienna, positing Freud as the first  profiler , and delving into his own  tangled and provocative personal life , Variety reported April 16. Mental detective Freud s case studies, crafted as stories or novellas, have yielded endless bounty for fiction writers. The studies are rich texts to be questioned, critiqued, studied, imitated, modified and fictionalised. One of Freud s best known case studies, described in his 1905 Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria, involves a young woman with limb pains and a hysterical loss of voice, whose symptoms Freud sees as displacements of sexual feelings rooted in childhood memories. Lidia Yuknavitch s edgy 2012 novel Dora: A Headcase, places Dora   whose real name was Ida Bauer   in contemporary Seattle with an analyst she calls Siggy.  I first read Freud s famous case study on hysteria based on his client Ida Bauer when I was in my 20s,  Yuknavitch told The Rumpus.  It pissed me off so badly it haunted me for 25 years. But I had to wait to be a good enough writer to give Ida her voice back.  The Dora case is also the basis of Sheila Kohler s new novel Dreaming for Freud. A beautiful 17-year-old patient is taken to Freud by her father.  He wants her to be more reasonable,  says Kohler.  He wants her to have an affair with his mistress s husband, but not to speak of it. She protests and she says the man has been after her since she was thirteen.  The girl finds Interpretation of Dreams in her father s library and decides to invent dreams to bring to Freud, feeding him fabrications in their sessions that appear in his later case study.  Freud s case studies are all written as mysteries, like Conan Doyle,  says Kohler, who has been teaching a class called Reading Freud's Great Case Histories as Short Stories at Princeton University this spring.  Each case study is a mystery. Each one he solves. Is he right? It doesn t really matter.  This mystery may, in the end, be the point. From his first publications, Freud s ideas were revolutionary and controversial. His followers   Carl Jung, Otto Rank, Alfred Adler, Karen Horney, Anna Freud, Melanie Klein and Erik Erikson among them   diverged from his original blueprint, extending and modifying psychoanalytic thought and practice to this day. Freud the author, awarded the 1930 Goethe prize for literature for his  clear and impeccable style , catalyst for innumerable other writers, may be as important as Freud the scientist. The highest measure of his meaning may derive from the echoes of his voice in artistic work. Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

        "content": "Why is one of Edinburgh's best views still off limits? 1 day ago Share Save Andrew Picken Share Save A look at Edinburgh's Radical Road which has been closed since 2018 It offers one of the iconic views of Edinburgh that has been celebrated in books and paintings for centuries. But access to the city's Radical Road path - set high along cliffs at Arthur's Seat, the extinct volcano that is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks - has been blocked since 2018. This was when 50 tonnes of rock fell from the cliffs, known as the Salisbury Crags, on to the path. The Radical Road was fenced off and years of rancour and indecision about reopening it have followed. Stretching for less than a mile in length, the Radical Road packs a lot in when it comes to rich history and stunning views of Scotland's capital. It overlooks the Scottish Parliament and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where senior royals stay when they visit Edinburgh. The path got its name from the unemployed west of Scotland weavers who were set to work paving a track around Salisbury Crags - a plan suggested by author Sir Walter Scott in the aftermath of the Radical War of 1820. It also contains the location where the founder of modern geology James Hutton arrived at his theory of how and when the world was formed. Why is the Radical Road closed? HES Some of the 50 tonnes of rock which fell from Salisbury Crags in 2018 Rockfalls on a narrow rocky path that clings to the side of a giant slab of dolerite rock are, unsurprisingly, not a new issue. The Radical Road has been regularly temporarily closed after significant volumes of rockfall over the last century, including a 100-tonne fall in 2011. The path was temporarily shut on five occasions in the two years before the 50-tonne fall in late 2018 sparked the current closure. At the time, park operator Historic Environment Scotland (HES) did not have an established policy on categorising what levels of rockfall risk would be considered acceptable. This was produced six years later and shows that three section of the Radical Road - the ones where it is at its narrowest below Salisbury Crags - currently present an unacceptable risk to the public. Why Edinburgh's best view has been hidden for seven years The section with the highest and intolerable risk has an estimated probability of a fatality from a rockfall event of one in 4,886. This compares with one in 95,435 for the section with a tolerable risk, where the rockface is set much further back from the path. Fairhurst, an engineering firm used by HES, also argues that its work elsewhere in the park has led it to conclude the \"number of actual rockfalls is higher than the number that is identified and reported in all areas \". What has been the impact of the closure? HES bills Holyrood Park as the \"most important open public space in the city\" so closing one of its most popular paths has had a big impact. The Radical Road itself has become overgrown without usage for years but HES says the wider path network is now \"highly degraded\" from the pressure of user numbers outweighing the capacity of the paths. Closures due to rockfalls elsewhere in the park, as well as wildfires, have not helped. HES does not have an up-to-date handle on how many people are using the park but an estimate from 2016 suggests more than two million visits a year. The 14 rangers who help manage the park are busier than ever. They dealt with 314 incidents, such as missing persons or fires, in 2023 - up from 162 incidents in 2018. HES Fences and warning signs greet visitors to the start of the Radical Road path At points the overgrowth nearly stretches across the whole path What needs to happen to reopen the Radical Road? Engineering firm Fairhurst first presented HES with options for long-term rockfall mitigation in 2019. It was asked to revise them in February last year to reflect the new rankings of what levels of rockfall risk would be considered acceptable. This report shows that to reopen the Radical Road the majority of the 0.8 miles (1.3km) route will need some form of engineered rockfall fence and netting. This would be similar to the measures in place on the rockface below Edinburgh Castle. Getty Images Steel netting has been in place on the rockface below Edinburgh Castle for years due to the risk of rockfall Other wider sections of the Radical Road would have a sloped earth embankment built to catch any rockfall. Fairhurst suggest this earth bund would need a fence on top to stop people getting in to the rock trap area. The firm's 2024 report estimates all of these remediation measures could cost up to  2.4m. Ranger-led guided walks in some sections of the Radical Road are available but a bigger step in the right direction for campaigners will come next year with a planned partial reopening. The areas marked in red are considered to present an unacceptable risk to the public of a fatality from rockfall Under the plan, the path between an area called The Hawse to the northern end of South Quarry would be open again. This will allow full access to the areas where James Hutton pioneered his theory that the Earth's age could be calculated using observations of volcanic rock. Edinburgh-based geologist Angus Miller, said: \"It's great that we are going to get access to the most geologically important features of the Radical Road but it has taken far too long. \"I don't think there has been an appreciation of what the route means to people and the impact of its closure on the wider park.\" Ramblers Scotland director Brendan Paddy said: \"After years of dithering, delay and broken promises, HES bosses must now stop kicking the can down the road. \"They must publish clear plans showing how they will reopen the 200-year-old Radical Road and boost the wider Holyrood Park path network - then urgently crack on with delivering trails worthy of this world-famous heritage site.\" Getty The dolerite rock of Salisbury Crags was quarried for use as cobble stones until it was outlawed in the 19th Century",

To mark the hundred-year anniversary, a new database containing thousands of personal records and documents from the time has been opened at the University of Oxford - making them fully accessible for the first time. The tomb of the former boy-king was discovered in 1922 by English archaeologist Howard Carter and his patron Lord Carnarvon from Hampshire. And between 11 and 19 November 1925, the pharaoh's body was meticulously unwrapped in a heavily symbolic and well documented process.

She owns and runs the family's ancestral seat at Highclere Castle, in Hampshire, alongside her husband, Lord Carnarvon's great-grandson the eighth Earl of Carnarvon. \"He's often misrepresented today,\" she said of Lord Carnarvon. \"People say he's just a one dimensional financier - far from it.\" \"He was a great traveller, a restless man, and he was always trying to find something else, which I think is innate in all of us,\" she explained. \"He spent the winter months out in Egypt, he became very adept - he wasn't a trained Egyptologist, but nor was Howard Carter.\" \"It was two unlikely Englishmen in some ways, but their resilience, passion, obsession, and obviously his money, led to the discovery of Tutankhamun.\" Getty Images Lady Carnarvon said her great-grandfather-in-law had been \"misunderstood\" Along with photographer Harry Burton, Carter and Lord Carnarvon meticulously documented the tomb's more than 5,000 objects. The collection, which includes thousands of photographs, drawings and notebook pages, was donated to the Griffith Institute, the centre for Egyptology at the University of Oxford, after Carter's death in 1939. \"These records show how the tomb looked like when it was discovered, so this shows you how Howard Carter and his team saw the tomb,\" Daniela Rosenow, manager of the Griffith Institute and Egyptologist, said. Now, for the first time, the records will be available to researchers and the general public on an easy accessible database created by the institute. \"We really hope this will nurture research on the objects, which is desperately needed,\" Ms Rosenow said. \"The tomb of Tutankhamun is still not that well published or studied, because it is not easy to access the actual objects.\" \"My hope is that much more will come out now everyone can search the records and do the research.\" Griffith Institute/Harry Burton It took a committee of experts nine days to unwrap the boy-king's body Lady Carnarvon, who has written a book on the subject, said the documents show the discovery had been the \"result of hard work... and of a really well planned concessions\". \"There was a plan, there was a strategy, but actually in some ways they found it against all the odds.\" And on that November day more than a century ago, Carter, Carnarvon and his daughter, Lady Evelyn, first climbed in to the perfectly intact tomb of the boy-king. Lady Carnarvon said her great-grandfather-in-law had tried to write about first seeing the chamber, but just said it was \"entirely surreal\". \"It was beyond anything they'd ever dreamt of,\" she said. The world's media went into frenzy over the discovery, with Carter and Carnarvon becoming world famous. Griffith Institute/Harry Burton Tutankhamun's burial mask was uncovered after millennia in situ Lady Carnarvon said she believes the interest in Tutankhamun comes from the \"totality of the treasures\". \"It is a window back in time, of a culture which spanned 5,000 years and created works of art and architecture, such as we probably haven't created in our own world after 2,000 years.\" Just months after the discovery, Lord Carnarvon died following a mosquito bite - with some in the media speculating that it was the result of a curse placed on the tomb of Tutankhamun. \"He sacrificed all that we can give,\" Lady Carnarvon said. \"You can read into it what you will.\" \"I think there's a lot we don't understand in this world and the next, however you choose to interpret our imagination and our consciousness,\" she added. Griffith Institute/Howard Carter Ms Rosenow said autopsy drawings done by Carter during the unwrapping were among her \"favourite archaeological records ever\" A beta version of the Oxford database launches on Tuesday, exactly a hundred years on from the unwrapping of Tutankhamun's mummy, and will showcase Carter's material from the de-mummifying process. \"We do have other royal mummies, but none before were found in their context, their tombs had all already been plundered in antiquity - this is the first and only time that a royal mummy had been discovered in situ,\" Ms Rosenow explained of the event's significance. \"This was all planned in a very scientific way, a committee of experts was gathered and it took them nine days to unwrap the body.\" She added: \"During these nine days, some of the most stunning archaeological records ever were produced.\" Getty Images The new Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo houses treasures from the tomb, including Tutankhamun's golden coffin The databases launch comes just weeks after the Grand Egyptian Museum fully opened in the shadow of the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza. Described as the world's largest archaeological museum, it is packed with some 100,000 artefacts - including the entire contents of Tutankhamun's tomb. \"You can now see all these objects carefully curated as individual masterpieces,\" Ms Rosenow said. \"But not everyone can travel to Egypt, and our database will give everyone around the world the sense of how the tomb originally looked.\" Once the database is completed, and the 5000 or so objects are inputted, Ms Rosenow said the next step was to create an interactive 3D digital model of the tomb as it was found. Tutankhamun Exhibition The Tutankhamun Exhibition in Dorchester gives visitors the chance to experience an exact replica of the tomb But in Dorchester, that is already a reality. The Tutankhamun Exhibition in the town gives visitors the chance to experience an exact replica of the tomb. Michael Ridley, the exhibition's director, said the showcase's journey from its original home at the British Museum had been an \"accident of history\". Struggles to find a suitable permanent home for the display eventually ended with the choice of a redundant church in Dorset's county town. It has remained there ever since, with more than two million people having visited it in that time. Mr Ridley said visitors came through the doors because Tutankhamun's story was \"in fact many stories\". \"It is about the discovery of treasure, it's because of the wonderful gold mask that covered the head of Tut's mummy, and because of the mystery of why and how this pharaoh died at the young age of 19,\" he said. Of the new database, Mr Ridley said its appeal was that \"documents are the raw material of history\". \"They combine with the evidence unearthed by archaeology to make sense of the past.\" Griffith Institute/Harry Burton Photographer Harry Burton meticulously photographed the de-mummifying process More than a century on from the discovery, the story of Tutankhamun and his uncovering after millennia still captivates and intrigues the world. \"I think it's like all the appeal of Rider Haggard, Indiana Jones and the missions that we set ourselves in life,\" Lady Carnarvon suggested on why interest remains. \"All of us are the same, and I think the ultimate desire we all have, a quest we all have, is for knowledge, or for treasure - and maybe knowledge is treasure.\" But Ms Rosenow suggested a different answer for the persisting interest. \"There's this mystery about this young man who died very unexpectedly, but also it's the amazing and beautiful objects,\" she said. \"They are visually striking and you learn so much about ancient Egypt, but also about this young person, Tutankhamun.\" \"Hopefully, a 100 years on, you can actually move away from the gold and the curse and look at the young man.\"",

        "content": "New exhibition celebrates town's Norwegian links 21 hours ago Share Save Molly Armstrong BBC Scotland, BBC Scotland Share Save BBC The Norwegian exhibition at Dumfries Museum runs until February next year A new exhibition has opened celebrating the long-standing links between Norway and a south of Scotland town. It is called \"Alt for Norge\" - which translates as \"All for Norway\" - a saying which dates back to World War II, when Dumfries became known as the \"unofficial Norwegian capital\". Over recent years, the balcony of Dumfries Museum has been completely revamped with a focus on military history. People with links to both countries attended the recent launch of the new archive material on display celebrating the Scandinavian connection. A telegram thanking the people of Dumfries is part of the exhibition In 1940 Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany, which meant many people fled and ended up in Dumfries. Many were based in Troqueer and Rosefield Mills, where they built a thriving community. This included setting up a Norwegian Society, where they hosted events from Burns suppers, to language classes. There were also 200 weddings between Norwegians and people from Dumfries, which is why some tourists from Norway continue to travel to Dumfries, so they can see where their parents got married. A launch of the exhibition celebrating the Norwegian links was held at Dumfries Museum Judith Hewitt, curator of the exhibition, said one special item in the exhibition was a telegram sent from Buckingham Palace in 1945. \"It's from the King of Norway, King Haakon VII, and it's to the provost of Dumfries on the liberation of Norway,\" she explained. \"It's giving thanks to the people of Dumfries for all they did to liberate his country. \"For a time in World War II, Dumfries was known as the capital city of Norway because so many Norwegians were here - 3,000 of them.\" Judith said the skis were her favourite part of the exhibition She said another special item was also worth highlighting. \"There's a famous campaign that the Norwegian army were involved in during World War II and it was to stop the Nazis getting the atom bomb,\" she said. \"I was told a long time ago that we had a set of skis in the museum collection that was used in the campaign to blow up the heavy water plant (a place where atom bombs could be manufactured) before the Nazis reached it.\" Judith said that the skis used came from Dumfries, which meant that the Norwegian army was carrying this small link to the town through their mode of transport. The display includes two uniforms worn by Norwegian soldiers \"They're with a big display about The Heroes of Telemark film, which is based on the book Skis Against the Atom, and it's quite probable that these skis saved the world,\" she said. Other items included are two uniforms of Norwegian soldiers with the photos and diplomas of the men who wore them along with an explanation of their Dumfries connection. The exhibition will run until 1 February next year.",

The 3,000-year-old artefact currently resides in the Great Hall at Chiddingstone Castle in Edenbridge, and the plan is to move it down several flights of stairs in order to be with similar relics in another part of the building. There it will be placed into a bespoke, museum-grade display case to make it more accessible to visitors. Curator Naomi Collick said its new home would also \"help preserve it for decades to come\". The operation to move the coffin lid will take place on 27 November, in plenty of time for when the castle, now closed for winter, reopens to the public in March. Studies of the coffin lid in 2017 revealed its origins, with analysis of its badly faded hieroglyphs identifying the name of the person for whom it was made. The middle of a set of three nested wooden coffins, it belonged to a man called Irethoreru, who lived during Egypt's 25th dynasty (circa 760   656BC). It will now be placed in the castle's designated Egyptian Room to sit alongside the rest of the historic collection from that period. Chiddingstone Castle The Egyptian Room at Chiddingstone Castle, which will be the coffin lid's new home Ms Collick said the move has been made possible with grants and donations from the William and Edith Oldham Charitable Trust, Museum Development South East and the Warren Meadows Trust. But she added the task would be far from an easy day's work. \"The castle's previous owner Denys Eyre Bower would have brought it here sometime between the 1950s and 1970s,\" she said. \"It's made of sections of wood, connected by wooden dowels, and covered with plaster and paint. \"It's not in bad shape for something of that age, but we are going to have to mount it on some type of carrying frame or stretcher in order to move it. \"We'll then pad it out with a protective material and use a couple of professional art handlers to help navigate it along the narrow corridors and down the stairs. \"It's going to be tricky, but it needs to happen as its current glass case isn't really fit for purpose anymore.\"",

The 5cm (2in) high jar is part of the Galloway Hoard - a collection described as one of the most important UK archaeological discoveries of the century. Decorated with a gold filigree - an intricate metalwork - experts say it resembles a perfume bottle. And a Latin inscription which translates as \"Bishop Hyguald had me made\" shows the vase likely had a religious function. When the jar was found it was wrapped in lengths of linen and placed in a silk-lined purse. Experts initially used 3D x-ray imaging to view the jar inside its wrapping without risking damaging the treasure. National Museums Scotland A Latin inscription is on the base of the jar The jar was then separated from its wrapping with painstaking care over a series of months. Due to these textile preservation methods, this is the first time the object has been available for public viewing. Dr Martin Goldberg from National Museums Scotland said: \"The rock crystal jar is one of the highlight objects from the Galloway Hoard. \"The jar was the subject of international attention when we first revealed the inscription, and it's great to be able to put it on display for the first time in Kirkcudbright.\" Due to gaps in 9th Century church records, it has not been possible to precisely identify Hyguald, but he was most likely a Northumbrian bishop. The inscription shows the clearest evidence that the hoard comes from a church or religious community in the early medieval kingdom of Northumbria. This included Dumfries and Galloway, and stretched all the way from Edinburgh to Sheffield. PA Media The Galloway Hoard was acquired by National Museums Scotland in 2017",

Work started in March to enhance the landmark, which has led to its removal from Historic England's at Risk Register. Rebecca Trimnell, from Gloucester City Council, said: \"I was delighted to see the archaeological team uncover part of the medieval wall around St Oswald's Priory, which is now visible for all to see.\" The site was built by Alfred the Great's eldest daughter and later became the resting place for the relics of the Christian martyr St Oswald. Small scale repairs to the stonework and improvements to the gravelled area have been carried out, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Jeremy Hilton, leader of the council, said: \"It needed some repair works and we just needed to make sure the structure was protected. \"Installing up-lighting really does help because it protects it from vandalism, particularly at night, which we were getting at periods of time.\" \"It has always been a wonderful historical landmark, but for many years it was looking very unloved,\" said Ms Trimnell. \"I am pleased to say with a lot of time and effort from a number of individuals it's now looking wonderful with new lights and new interpretation boards also installed.\" The local authority received grants of  20,000 from Historic England and  16,000 from the government's Shared Prosperity Fund to carry out the work, which includes improvements to the landscaping, new architectural lighting and CCTV cameras.

Destiny of the Republic includes sections on Republican Party factionalism, the antiseptics preferred by British surgeon Joseph Lister and Alexander Graham Bell's invention of an early metal detector, used eventually to search for the bullet in Garfield's body. Makowsky chose to focus on the contrasting journeys of Guiteau and Garfield. \"Both men cared very much about being known,\" he said. \"One propels himself to the highest office in the land, whereas the other courts greatness and never achieves it.\" The killer's motivation By turns Guiteau failed as a lawyer, a journalist and an evangelical preacher. He even flopped at the free love commune he joined; no woman would sleep with him, as Millard recounts. Yet he always believed God intended him for a grand purpose. Guiteau became obsessed with Garfield after the congressman's unlikely nomination, and travelled to New York in the summer of 1880, determined to play a crucial role ensuring his victory in the general election. Guiteau harassed the staff at Garfield's New York campaign office until he was allowed to give a single rambling speech endorsing the candidate. Garfield vocally opposed the spoils system of handing out lucrative posts to supporters, yet Guiteau believed in it fiercely. He expected that, in exchange for his backing, Garfield, now president, would give him a key post. Ambassador to France was his first choice. The deluded man travelled to Washington, and appeared at the White House every day with hordes of other insistent office seekers. Guiteau even came face to face with his hero once, in the president's office, where he handed Garfield a copy of his election speech, with \"Paris Consulship\" scrawled on it, and a line connecting those words to his name. Garfield, meanwhile, embarked on an ambitious agenda for his presidency, including upgrading the US Navy, aiming to expand trade with Latin America, and advocating for civil rights. He appointed the once-enslaved social reformer Frederick Douglass as recorder of deeds for the District of Columbia, the first African American to hold a prominent federal office. At the same time, Garfield also had to face down Roscoe Conkling, Republican senator from New York, arguably the most powerful politician in the nation, thanks to his indirect control of the lucrative customs revenue flowing into the port of New York. Conkling didn't like Garfield's progressive instincts nor his opposition to the spoils system. He'd already imposed on candidate Garfield his associate Chester A Arthur, to be vice president. Now Conkling sought to block Garfield's Cabinet picks.",

        "content": "This French glacier has given rise to countless works of art in the past 200 years, including Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Paintings, photographs and modern satellites reveal how the site has dramatically transformed since Shelley was first transfixed by it. In the 1800s, above the town of the Chamonix in the French Alps, there was a sublime sight known as the \"sea of ice\" that provoked both awe and a touch of dread. Those who climbed up the mountain trails to see it would encounter an icy, barren expanse of white, dark blue and aquamarine. Visitors described a scene akin to a torrent of waves and whirlpools frozen in time; an unrelenting frost extending boundlessly into the mountains. Many artists at the time painted this icy sea, but one of the most striking images is an early photograph: a gloomy daguerreotype taken by an assistant of the writer John Ruskin in the 1850s (above). This was the \"Mer de Glace\" glacier   a mass of compacted snowfall, creeping down from the Mont Blanc massif. For centuries, it has remained the largest glacier in France, and was one of the first to be studied scientifically. Sadly, it has shrunk profoundly since then   more than 2.5km (1.6 miles) since the mid-1800s   and as I discovered following a recent visit, it is barely visible from the same point that the Ruskin photo was taken. The melting is accelerating, and by 2050, scientists anticipate it could retreat by at least 2km (1.2 miles) further, even with stringent emissions reductions.",

        "content": "Perhaps the most informative and convenient way to get around is on the new double decker City Sightseeing bus, launched in February 2013, which delivers historical commentary as it travels the streets of downtown Jo burg and beyond. Make sure to stop off at Constitution Hill: today, this is the site of the South African Constitutional Court, but visitors will also learn about a rather less cheery era in the country s history. Its Old Fort is a former prison that operated from pre-Boer War times in the late 19th Century and throughout the apartheid era until its closure in 1987. Mandela spent short stints here in 1956 and 1962 while awaiting trial, and although the cells he occupied have since been demolished, a recreated one contains a permanent exhibition documenting his stay both here and on Cape Town s Robben Island, largely through correspondence written during his incarceration. The one-time prison also offers a chilling look at the apartheid regime, where deep racial inequalities permeated even the penal system. The sightseeing bus then takes you on an equally emotional ride to the excellent Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg South, where the exhibition is as superbly moving as it is distressing. Understanding the political system that ruled South Africa from 1948 to 1994 is essential to understanding Mandela himself, and a couple of hours spent walking through recent history will help untangle the extent of the complex web of laws that segregated every aspect of South African society. Throughout the 1950s and  60s, Mandela s home was a simple dwelling on Vilakazi Street in Soweto, a thriving suburb 30km southwest of Johannesburg   though his underground political activities meant that he spent little time here with wife Winnie and their two daughters. Today, the house is preserved as a museum, and while the information panels go a long way to explaining this era in Mandela s life, it is the impassioned guided tours that make this a must-see stop. In those final years before his lengthy incarceration (1962 to 1990), Mandela also spent time in a farmhouse 28km to the north of the city. In the 1960s, Liliesleaf Farm was the headquarters of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the then-banned ANC. Today it has been transformed into a magnificent museum, where interactive exhibits draw visitors into a fascinating chapter in South African history. Information is abundant, so be sure to set aside half a day to fully appreciate the role that Liliesleaf played in the resistance movement. Cape Town and around: Imprisonment and freedom (1964 to 1990) After the Rivonia Trial, which began with the Liliesleaf raid in 1963 and wrapped up in 1964, in which 10 leaders of the ANC were tried for acts of sabotage designed to overthrow the apartheid system, Mandela was moved to Robben Island, South Africa s answer to Alcatraz. Lying 7km off Cape Town s coast, the island served as a jail, a leper colony and a World War II fortification before returning to its roots in 1961 as a maximum security prison with virtually no chance of escape. Today the building is a museum, and it s is one of the main attractions in a city awash with activities and sights. Board a ferry at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront for the half day trip that takes in the choppy seas, tours the island and makes an all-important stop at the cell that held prisoner 46664 for much of his 27 years behind bars. Towards the end of his incarceration, Mandela was moved between prisons in the Cape. Both Pollsmoor Prison and Drakenstein Correctional Centre (formerly Victor Verster Prison) remain in use, and the latter, 70km east of Cape Town in the Winelands, is worth a visit. It is here that Mandela spent his final days of imprisonment and where the memorable scenes of him walking free for the first time in almost three decades were shot. A bronze statue of the great man, hand raised in triumph, commemorates the moment. If you re lucky, you might find a warden to take you on a quick unofficial tour of the cottage where he spent his final years of captivity. Back in Cape Town, there is one more sight to see: the Edwardian City Hall facade overlooking Grand Parade. This large square is home to a daily bustling market, but on 11 February 1990, thousands gathered in this spot to hear Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela speak from the balcony as a free man for the first time in more than 27 years. Visit on a Sunday when the square is quieter and ponder the life of a man who epitomised forgiveness and reconciliation, and inspired not only a nation, but the rest of the world as well.",

In the autumn of 1608, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, the most original Italian painter of the 17th Century, was on the run. Tempestuous and arrogant, Caravaggio was forever getting into brawls. He swaggered about with a sword at his side and once flung a plate of scalding artichokes in the face of a waiter, supposedly because some of them were cooked in butter rather than oil. Yet even by his own combustible standards two years earlier he had crossed a line, when he killed a man in a quarrel over a gambling debt at a tennis match. Before he could be charged with murder, he fled Rome and spent the rest of his short life as a fugitive from justice. That autumn in 1608, following spells in Naples and Malta, he arrived in Sicily. He stayed on the island for around a year, sleeping fitfully with a dagger by his side, and painting several late masterpieces, including the Nativity with San Lorenzo and San Francesco.",

        "content": "Another issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive. The answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\" In History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.  to the accompanying weekly newsletter. This elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A 12.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\" The project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"",

        "content": "Vladimir Syromiatnikov's bold attempts to light up Siberia with a space mirror captured global attention. The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993. It sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993. But the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell. WATCH: 'On a clear night, it could illuminate an area the size of a football stadium'. Even today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one. Back in 1923, German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth had proposed it in The Rocket into Planetary Space. His self-published book   based on a PhD thesis which Heidelberg University had rejected for seeming too implausible   demonstrated mathematically how a rocket could leave the Earth's orbit. Among the other ideas covered in the publication were the potential effects on the human body of space travel, how satellites could be launched into orbit, and, crucially, the concept of creating a grid of colossal adjustable concave mirrors that could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the Earth. Oberth reasoned that this illumination could help avert disasters   like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912   or assist with the rescue of their survivors. Oberth also speculated that space mirrors could be used to clear shipping lanes by melting icebergs or even to manipulate the Earth's weather patterns.",

        "content": "Mary Poppins had long been something of a passion project for Walt Disney. In the early 1940s, he had promised his daughters, who were fans of the first book, that he would adapt it into a movie. But he had not counted upon its notoriously prickly author, Travers. He spent the next 20 years repeatedly trying to persuade her to sell him the screen rights. By the 1960s, despite Travers' serious misgivings about Disney's much more jolly, whimsical take on the darker elements of Mary Poppins, the author s increasingly dire financial situation forced her to relent. Despite author PL Travers describing Mary Poppins in the books as being very plain, Disney had a clear idea he wanted Andrews for the 'practically perfect in every way' nanny In 2013, Disney would depict their founder's fractious relationship with the intransigent Travers, and his efforts to bring the book to the screen, in the film Saving Mr Banks. In keeping with the author's fears about the adaptation of her own book, some critics claimed that the film portrayed a highly sanitised version of their antagonistic relationship, and the two complicated people involved. Despite Travers describing Mary Poppins in the books as being very plain, Disney had a clear idea about who he wanted for the \"'practically perfect in every way'\" nanny   and that was Julie Andrews. A fast-rising talent By this time, Andrews had already established a successful stage career on both sides of the Atlantic. Born in 1935, in Surrey, in the UK, Andrews' mother and stepfather, on discovering their daughter's exceptional singing ability and four-octave vocal range, propelled her towards a career on stage. By the age of 12, she was astonishing West End audiences in London with her clear, melodic soprano voice. In 1954, she made her US debut on Broadway in the immensely popular The Boy Friend, but it was her role as Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in the 1956 musical My Fair Lady that really brought her to people's attention. The production proved to be a perfect showcase for her talents   earning her a Tony Award nomination   and by 1958 was the highest-grossing Broadway show of all-time.",

Described by experts as the county's \"ancient sacred heart\", Castilly Henge is believed to have been built during the late Neolithic period - about 3,000 to 2,500 BCE (Before Common Era). More than  40,000 of National Lottery funding was awarded to Cornwall Heritage Trust (CHT) to excavate a hidden stone circle at its centre earlier this year. Carolyn Kennett, CHT's site project manager, said: \"Neolithic henges are incredibly rare, so this is a really exciting moment.\" Is there a Bronze Age stone circle in Bodmin? Located just off the A30 near Bodmin, the substantial oval embankment that makes up Castilly Henge is believed to have been once used as an amphitheatre-like setting for gatherings and ritual activities. Its significance continued into the Early Bronze Age (circa 2,400 to 1,500 BCE) when several high-status burial mounds or barrows were built close by. Previous researchers also suggested that the site might have been used as a medieval open-air theatre known as a plen-an-gwari, as well as fortified housing for cannons during the English Civil War. The four-week archaeological excavation, which is a collaboration between the CHT, Cornwall Archaeological Society and Historic England, aimed to delve deeper into the monument's backstory, project leaders said. Historic England & Cornwall Archaeology Unit A large team of volunteers and experts are working to excavate the site Possible traces of a long-vanished stone circle at the site were discovered in 2022, of which only one other example is known to survive in Cornwall. Ms Kennett said she hoped that the henge - which is at risk from invasive vegetation and nearby road infrastructure - could be saved for future generations. \"Our goal is to fundraise to purchase this site and to open it up to public,\" she said, adding that more than  10,000 of an overall  50,000 target had already been raised. Dr Olaf Bayer, senior archaeological investigator for Historic England, described the henge as offering a \"direct visceral connection\" to our ancestors. \"To discover and hold in your own hands the very tools people of the past had used - it's the kind of stuff that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck,\" he said.",

Dr Lindsey B ster's research claims to be the first to focus on the lives and experiences of older adults in prehistoric and Roman Europe and will examine skeletons and objects, many from York Museums Trust. It's hoped the project, known as Age-Old Stories, will help challenge existing stereotypes and ageism. \"They have a very large collection of Roman human remains from across Yorkshire and that's going to be a really important assemblage for us,\" said Dr B ster. Getty Images The study will also look at human remains from the Bronze Age period \"The ultimate aim is for the research to provide strong examples of why making older adults more visible in policy-making and public life is so important,\" said Dr B ster. \"Ageing is not a marginal experience, it is a central part of human history and we should have better strategies for valuing and celebrating it today.\" Archaeological discoveries already suggest that older adults were central figures in many past societies. In Scarborough, the remains of Gristhorpe Man, Britain's best-preserved Early Bronze Age skeleton were analysed and suggested that he was aged between 45 and 60 years, tall and muscular, and nourished by a rich diet. \"He is over 45 and he was buried in this log coffin, which would've been hugely time consuming, hugely labour intensive and he's buried with a dagger,\" said Dr B ster. \"These are all the trappings of a high status individual.\" The project will also work in partnership with York Museums Trust to create a new exhibition and public events and will also collaborate with Age Friendly York.

On 23 September, 1779, beneath Bempton Cliffs, a French and American fleet of four ships swooped in and attacked two British Royal Navy vessels that were escorting a convoy. The USS Bonhomme Richard, under the command of Scottish-born naval captain John Paul Jones, managed to capture the frigate HMS Serapis. The Battle of Flamborough Head, during the American War of Independence, is now one of the most celebrated naval actions in US history. To mark the 246th anniversary, a refurbished monument, known as a toposcope, will be unveiled on the cliff tops with markings pointing to the site of the battle. One of the organisers, Kim Hodgson, secretary of Yorkshire Coast 1779, said Jones is seen as \"the father of the US Navy\". \"They actually still teach the Battle of Flamborough Head to every midshipman that goes through their officer training,\" she said. \"They see him as a hero and so it is a very important battle for the Americans. \"It gave the Americans a boost that they could just about win the war because at the time America was not doing very well, they were suffering quite a few defeats over in the colonies, so this really gave them a boost of confidence. \"The Royal Navy was outnumbered two to one but they managed to protect the convoy, it was saved, but they did lose both their ships.\" Getty Images Scottish-born naval captain John Paul Jones is seen as the father figure of the US Navy According to the research group, more than 400 men and boys were killed and injured when Captain Jones captured the Serapis, with his own Bonhomme Richard later sinking. Ms Hodgson added: \"The Americans treat it as a battle that they won. They may have captured two ships but they didn't achieve their objective, which was to capture some of those supply ships. \"They got off with the two Royal Navy ships but they didn't achieve their objective, but the Royal Navy did. That's why we want to raise this significant event.\" Legend has it that when the two ships were side by side firing broadsides into each other the captain of HMS Serapis asked Jones if he was prepared to surrender, to which he reportedly replied \"I have not yet begun to fight\". The refurbished toposcope was first installed on Bempton Cliffs in 1959 The toposcope will be unveiled in the presence of the Lord Lieutenant of East Yorkshire, Jim Dick OBE, Michael Rice, High Sheriff of East Yorkshire, Charlie Dewhirst MP for Bridlington and the Wolds and Liam Dealtry, chairman of East Riding of Yorkshire Council. It was originally built in 1959 and has been refurbished and made more accessible. As well as arrows pointing to the site of the battle, panels will be installed giving more information about the skirmish, allowing visitors to \"look out to sea and reimagine this ferocious battle and what it must have been like for the terrified locals watching this\". Ms Hodgson said the monument was a \"really nice opportunity to remember our history and the significance of what the Yorkshire Coast played in that little bit of a historic timeline in 1779\". She added: \"Isn't it amazing that in 1779 we were fighting with each other, but over the course of the last 250 years we have been good friends, sometimes best friends and always managed to turn that relationship around.\" Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.

The piece of gilded silver jewellery was discovered by a metal detectorist at Carleton Rode, near Attleborough, Norfolk, earlier this year. Dr Natasha Harlow, an expert in portable Iceni objects, said it was quite a rare piece and was probably made in East Anglia. The brooch is going through the treasure process and Norwich Castle Museum is hoping to acquire it. \"It would have been very eye-catching, as it was made from silver and it was partly gilded, so it had these flashes of gold and silver,\" said Dr Harlow, who is an honorary research fellow at the University of Nottingham. \"[The Iron Age] would have been a very bright and colourful world to live in, which is not necessarily what we think of when we think of British pre-Roman history.\" Andrew Williams/Norfolk County Council Only 17 similar brooches have been found in Norfolk making then quite rare, said Natasha Harlow The find has been dated to between 30BC and AD60 and is reminiscent of other late Iron Age finds from Norfolk, she said. In particular, she pointed to three little pellet shapes at its base, which are seen in Iceni coins and horse metal work. The Iceni were a tribe occupying present-day Norfolk and Suffolk and are most famous for queen Boudicca, who led a revolt against the Romans. Dr Harlow said: \"In northern East Anglia, there is a regional distinctiveness to the settlements and we tend to see people showing their wealth and status through the small items they wore - it shows something about the wearer's importance and access to resources.\" This style of brooch is known as the Birdlip type, because the first one of its kind was found at Birdlip, near Gloucester. In a time before buttons and zips, brooches were also believed to have had a practical purpose, acting as safety pins to hold clothes together, Dr Harlow added. A coroner at a treasure inquest typically decides whether the discovery is treasure, and therefore whether a museum should have first refusal over it.

The Great Fire of Northampton destroyed 700 out of 850 buildings and claimed 11 lives within hours of starting on 20 September 1675. The anniversary has been commemorated with a series of events in the town over six months. But, what caused the devastating blaze and how did Charles II help with its rebuild? The BBC has been finding out. 'Densely packed and filthy' Joseph Ashmenall/BBC One of the few houses to survive the conflagration was Hazelrigg House, part of which did need rebuilding Northampton in 1675 was still essentially a medieval town, densely packed with lots of alleyways, having evolved in a random way over centuries, according to Alan Clark, an expert on the town's history. \"At the same time there was a population increase in what was a golden era of English market towns in terms of commercial activity, which meant the population density was such that properties were simply ramshackle, insalubrious and often filthy,\" he added. The vast majority of the buildings were thatched and built from timber frames with plaster walls imbedded with straw and horse hair - all highly flammable. Dr Clark said the local authorities were well aware of this, repeatedly urging people to maintain what fire precautions were in place. Meanwhile, conditions across the country were tinder-dry. \"[The year] 1675 is known for a terrible drought, which began in January and continued throughout the year,\" he said. \"So along with supplies like hay for horses and barrels of alcohol, it was a recipe for disaster,\" he added. 'Going up in a whoosh' Nick Moses/BBC James Miller (left) and Earl Spencer (right) have been researching the Great Fire of Northampton The fire is believed to have started accidentally on St Mary's Street, now Chalk Lane. Dr Clark said: \"It's reported that late in the morning of 20 September, a woman put a kettle on an open fire and left it unattended, so this is just a simple human occurrence - except that on this day a very stiff wind, blowing directly from the west, had been suddenly picking up in speed and strength. \"It may have contributed to the ignition of the fire at that lady's property and fanned those flames into and affecting other properties.\" An eyewitness riding past the town and bound for London would later describe the astonishing speed of the blaze that ripped through the town. Earl Spencer, who has has written several historical books and co-hosts a history podcast, said: \"I've read contemporary accounts that say the Great Fire of Northampton was more devastating than the Great Fire of London (1666) for its scale. \"You think of these quite compressed, highly combustible buildings going up in a whoosh.\" Trapped in the market square Joseph Ashmenall/BBC Many of the townsfolk fled to the safety of the market square - reportedly the largest in the Midlands - only to seek escape through the Welsh House (above) As the blaze began at about midday, people could grab some of their possessions and flee, said art historian James Miller, who worked on the town's anniversary events. \"They weren't in their beds, they knew it was coming and they all rushed to the large Market Square because they thought that would be quite safe,\" he said. But the square was packed with more combustible material, which also caught fire and \"whoosh off it went\" trapping them, he said. Just as they feared the worst, the terrified people discovered an opening at The Welsh House, in the square's north-eastern corner, enabling them to cross its grounds by the side of the property to make their escape. Meanwhile, the fire reached All Hallows Church, south of the Market Square, which supercharged the blaze. Dr Clark said: \"Its central crossing tower becomes a chimney and magnifies, radiates and increases the intensity of the heat and so the fire reignites and this then allows it to leap spaces and to spread and continue eastward to St Giles' Church.\" Then the weather that had helped whip up the conflagration, suddenly came to the town's aid. Mr Miller said: \"The next morning, a gale took place and it drenched the town - it had burnt down but within 36 hours, it was sodden and the fire was out.\" 'You should have seen the looting' Joseph Ashmenall/BBC All Saints' Church stands on the site of the burned-out All Hallows' Church and was built within five years of the devastating blaze Thousands of people were now without their homes - more than 80% of the town's properties were uninhabitable. They were about to benefit from a rapid rebuild thanks to lessons learned from the Great Fire of London - and royal support. Dr Clark said it had taken five months to pass an Act of Parliament for London's rebuild and this set the foundations for helping destroyed towns and cities going forward. \"One of the first buildings to be constructed was the Sessions House in 1678, because it is regulating the economy, levying taxes and fines and reconstitution of law and order,\" he said. \"This mattered, because an anecdote from the time was, 'If you thought the fire was bad, you should have seen the looting'.\" Next to be rebuilt was All Saints' Church, constructed on the foundations of All Hallows and funded by the ecclesiastical authorities. Dr Clark said, for many people, the immediate impact of the blaze was devastating - \"exceptional poverty becomes rampant, people starve and are left impoverished\". 'An act of reconciliation' Getty Images Charles II (1660 to 1685) became one of the chief benefactors of the construction effort Leading local figures stepped in with offers of help. The Reverend Oliver Cross, the rector of All Saints' Church, said: \"The Earl of Northampton turned up the day after the fire and donated  150 for the immediate aid effort.\" Others who helped the rebuild efforts were chief justice Sir Richard Rainsford, who had experience working on the aftermath of the Great Fire of London, and Sir Roger Norwich. Prior to the fire, Charles II had pulled down Northampton's town walls to punish its people for Parliamentarian supporters during the English Civil Wars of the 1640s and 1650s. Father Cross said: \"It was only after the Great Fire that an incredible act of reconciliation took place between the Parliamentarian town and the crown, which meant Charles II became the chief benefactor of the construction effort. He donated more than 1,000 tonnes of timber to reconstruct All Saints' Church and halved the town's taxes for seven years following the fire. All Saints' Church still remembers that help by marking Oak Apple Day, which commemorates the restoration of the Stuart kings to the English throne, said Father Cross.

Dr Clark said: \"It's reported that late in the morning of 20 September, a woman put a kettle on an open fire and left it unattended, so this is just a simple human occurrence - except that on this day a very stiff wind, blowing directly from the west, had been suddenly picking up in speed and strength. \"It may have contributed to the ignition of the fire at that lady's property and fanned those flames into and affecting other properties.\" An eyewitness riding past the town and bound for London would later describe the astonishing speed of the blaze that ripped through the town. Earl Spencer, who has has written several historical books and co-hosts a history podcast, said: \"I've read contemporary accounts that say the Great Fire of Northampton was more devastating than the Great Fire of London (1666) for its scale. \"You think of these quite compressed, highly combustible buildings going up in a whoosh.\" Trapped in the market square Joseph Ashmenall/BBC Many of the townsfolk fled to the safety of the market square - reportedly the largest in the Midlands - only to seek escape through the Welsh House (above) As the blaze began at about midday, people could grab some of their possessions and flee, said art historian James Miller, who worked on the town's anniversary events. \"They weren't in their beds, they knew it was coming and they all rushed to the large Market Square because they thought that would be quite safe,\" he said. But the square was packed with more combustible material, which also caught fire and \"whoosh off it went\" trapping them, he said. Just as they feared the worst, the terrified people discovered an opening at The Welsh House, in the square's north-eastern corner, enabling them to cross its grounds by the side of the property to make their escape. Meanwhile, the fire reached All Hallows Church, south of the Market Square, which supercharged the blaze. Dr Clark said: \"Its central crossing tower becomes a chimney and magnifies, radiates and increases the intensity of the heat and so the fire reignites and this then allows it to leap spaces and to spread and continue eastward to St Giles' Church.\" Then the weather that had helped whip up the conflagration, suddenly came to the town's aid. Mr Miller said: \"The next morning, a gale took place and it drenched the town - it had burnt down but within 36 hours, it was sodden and the fire was out.\" 'You should have seen the looting' Joseph Ashmenall/BBC All Saints' Church stands on the site of the burned-out All Hallows' Church and was built within five years of the devastating blaze Thousands of people were now without their homes - more than 80% of the town's properties were uninhabitable. They were about to benefit from a rapid rebuild thanks to lessons learned from the Great Fire of London - and royal support. Dr Clark said it had taken five months to pass an Act of Parliament for London's rebuild and this set the foundations for helping destroyed towns and cities going forward. \"One of the first buildings to be constructed was the Sessions House in 1678, because it is regulating the economy, levying taxes and fines and reconstitution of law and order,\" he said. \"This mattered, because an anecdote from the time was, 'If you thought the fire was bad, you should have seen the looting'.\" Next to be rebuilt was All Saints' Church, constructed on the foundations of All Hallows and funded by the ecclesiastical authorities. Dr Clark said, for many people, the immediate impact of the blaze was devastating - \"exceptional poverty becomes rampant, people starve and are left impoverished\". 'An act of reconciliation' Getty Images Charles II (1660 to 1685) became one of the chief benefactors of the construction effort Leading local figures stepped in with offers of help. The Reverend Oliver Cross, the rector of All Saints' Church, said: \"The Earl of Northampton turned up the day after the fire and donated  150 for the immediate aid effort.\" Others who helped the rebuild efforts were chief justice Sir Richard Rainsford, who had experience working on the aftermath of the Great Fire of London, and Sir Roger Norwich. Prior to the fire, Charles II had pulled down Northampton's town walls to punish its people for Parliamentarian supporters during the English Civil Wars of the 1640s and 1650s. Father Cross said: \"It was only after the Great Fire that an incredible act of reconciliation took place between the Parliamentarian town and the crown, which meant Charles II became the chief benefactor of the construction effort. He donated more than 1,000 tonnes of timber to reconstruct All Saints' Church and halved the town's taxes for seven years following the fire. All Saints' Church still remembers that help by marking Oak Apple Day, which commemorates the restoration of the Stuart kings to the English throne, said Father Cross.

One pilot tells BBC Future what it feels like to fly them. They are two of the most celebrated aircraft still flying today. The two Boeing B-29s flown by the Commemorative Air Force (CAF) in the US are the last airworthy examples of nearly 4,000 built in the mid-1940s, the largest bomber in the world at that time and a design which pushed aviation technology to the limit. The aircraft, nicked \"Fifi\" and \"Doc\" by the CAF, take part in airshows across the US during the summer, where aviation fans can pay to ride along in 30-minute-long demonstration flights. The Boeing B-29 was the most advanced bomber in the world when it entered service in 1945: it was the first mass-produced aircraft to have pressurised compartments for the crew, and it could fly higher and further than any other aircraft thanks to its four enormous engines. These engines also helped it fly almost as fast as the fighter planes of the time. Designing and building it cost more than the atomic bombs that B-29s would eventually drop on Japan to end World War Two. Bringing the B-29 into service was a colossal industrial project that at times overwhelmed Boeing. Its engines were powerful but temperamental, and keeping them in line required the full-time attention of a dedicated flight engineer, who kept a beady eye on engine temperatures to avoid the engines catching fire from overheating. Even getting a B-29 airborne for its mission over Japan required great effort in the humid air of tropical airfields. So, 80 years after the B-29 helped bring the world's most costly conflict to a close, what is it like to fly one now?",

        "content": "FBI returns stolen conquistador document to Mexico Cort s was an explorer who brought about the end of the Aztec empire and helped pave the way for the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. The manuscript details plans for his journey across what would become New Spain. The page - which describes payments made for supplies for expeditions - was discovered in the US and repatriated on Wednesday. The manuscript page was penned in 1527 and is one of 15 pages thought to have been swiped from Mexico's national archives between 1985 and 1993, the US investigatory agency said. The FBI has returned a 500-year-old stolen document signed by Spanish conquistador Hern n Cort s to Mexico. At its height, the colony stretched across much of western and central North America, and into Latin America. The previously missing document was written after Cort s had been made the governor of New Spain by the Spanish crown. Mexico's national archives had counted the document among a collection of papers signed by Cort s - but found 15 pages were missing when it was put on microfilm in 1993. The recovered page bore a number written in wax that archivists had applied in 1985-1986, suggesting it had been stolen between the two cataloguing periods. The Mexican government requested the assistance of the FBI's art crime team in finding the missing documents in 2024, providing notes on which pages had been taken and how certain pages had been torn. The FBI said open-source research revealed the document was located in the US. The agency did not reveal exactly where the manuscript page was found or who had owned it when it was seized. No one will face prosecution over the theft as the page had \"changed hands several times\" since it was stolen, according to Special Agent Jessica Dittmer of the FBI's art crime team. The document \"really gives a lot of flavour as to the planning and preparation for uncharted territory back then\", she said, outlining \"the payment of pesos of common gold for expenses in preparation for discovery of the spice lands\". The so-called \"spice lands\" were areas of eastern and southern Asia. Europeans sought to find a quicker trade route with these areas by sailing west, but in doing so landed on the Americas instead. Cort s would go on to explore north-western Mexico and the Baja California peninsula. The document's repatriation comes at a time of political tension between Mexico and the US over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and illegal migration across the US-Mexico border. But the FBI says that, as one of the largest consumers of antiquities, the US had a responsibility to counter the trafficking of artefacts. Ms Dittmer said: \"Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico's history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their archives for the purpose of understanding history better.\" The FBI said it was determined to locate and repatriate the other pages still missing from the collection. Another document signed by Cort s was returned to Mexico by the FBI in 2023.",

The plans were spread across numerous pages, some with lines crossed through, and others with annotations. Previously Matt Crowson, from Hansons, told the BBC: \"It's an incredible story - the document had been part of a dusty box of papers in a UK saleroom, the value of which was considered negligible. \"But on closer examination the vendor came across a piece of World War Two history detailing the freeing of the only Nazi-occupied area of the British Isles.\" The file was formerly the property of Sub-Lieutenant Walter Page, of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, who was also part of the Normandy invasion.

The team from the University of Southampton said it was the first time one from this period had been totally uncovered in the UK. Buckler's Hard, the small hamlet in the New Forest where the slipway is located, was once home to one of the busiest private shipyards of the 1700s. The researchers said they hoped the findings would help improve their understanding of shipbuilding techniques and infrastructure during the period. The slipway is the first of its era to be fully revealed in the UK The dig was supported by the newly formed Buckler's Hard Shipyard Trust, a conservation charity. A total of 55 wooden warships were built at Buckler's Hard for the Royal Navy in the 1700s, some of which were comparable in size to HMS Victory. \"No other private yard built as many ships for the navy during this period,\" said Prof Jon Adams, director of the university's Centre for Maritime Archaeology. Prof Jon Adams said Buckler's Hard provided a unique look into the shipbuilding techniques and infrastructure of the time Unlike the slipway at Buckler's Hard, most slipways from the 18th Century are now buried under concrete. Prof Adams said that made this one uniquely suited for learning about traditional shipbuilding. \"The only opportunity is a place like this where you can actually see the whole of the whole of the infrastructure and the logistical structures needed to build ships of that size,\" he said. The team also found some historical curiosities, such as musket balls and fastening nails from the 1700s",

In recent days, the names Patrick, Lily and Liana have appeared cut deeply into three stones. South Wales Police is investigating the damage as a heritage crime, with support from Cadw, the body which preserves and protects Welsh heritage. Cadw said criminal damage to listed buildings was on the increase, adding this year could see the highest ever number of reported crimes of damage and vandalism at some of Wales' ancient sites. The body said heritage crime was widely under-reported but rising, and encouraged anyone who witnesses suspicious behaviour at heritage sites to report it. It is a criminal offence to damage or destroy a scheduled monument or use metal detectors on protected sites without consent. Erica Staple, from nearby Merthyr Mawr, said it was \"mindless and unacceptable\". Ms Staple likened the damage to the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland. \"This is an absolutely beautiful place,\" she said. \"The whole village is upset by it.

She added despite the names written on the stone, the community had \"no idea\" who could have carried out the damage, which had \"clearly taken planning\". \"We don't know if they could be local or visiting the area. \"But we just don't know. There are different theories. We hope that the police and Cadw find out.\" What is heritage crime? Heritage crime refers to any illegal activity that harms historical assets.

The Buckinghamshire Council site in High Wycombe has four separate buildings, including a neo-Georgian structure built in 1932. A Conservative councillor said she was \"exceptionally disappointed that this wonderful building is being sold\". The council said the site was \"currently underused\" and offered a \"prime location\". The 1932 building in Queen Victoria Road was designed by Richard Greaves Brocklehurst and Charles Cowles-Voysey in the neo-Georgian style. The Royal Institute of British Architects awarded a bronze medal for the design. On Tuesday, the Conservative-controlled council's cabinet will decide whether the sale of the site should go ahead with the most likely outcome being a residential development. A drawing of a possible design for the land shows about 180 flats across three buildings of up to seven storeys.

        "content": "Volunteers reclaiming much loved historic railway 5 September 2025 Share Save Bea Swallow, BBC News, West of England and Luke Knight, BBC Radio Somerset Share Save The historic line ran between Bath in Somerset and Bournemouth in Dorset For more than a century the Somerset and Dorset Railway (S&D) served as a lifeline for rural communities - transporting coal, commuters and holidaymakers alike. The historic line ran between Bath in Somerset and Bournemouth in Dorset, serving towns and villages such as Highbridge, Glastonbury, Wells, and Wincanton. This week is the 60th anniversary since the 105-mile (168km) route was given a public notice it had to close all its station due to the Beeching cuts - a sweeping reduction of the UK rail network that severed thousands of miles of track. But now volunteers, historians and local residents are reclaiming sections of the abandoned route, determined to preserve the once rich history of the railway line. Julian Peters The historic line ran between Bath in Somerset and Bournemouth in Dorset In the 1960s, the British railway system was considered financially unsustainable, with underused lines, high maintenance costs, and slow passenger services. Dr Richard Beeching, former chair of the British Railways Board, aimed to modernise the railways by eliminating unprofitable routes and stations to create a more efficient, financially sound network. A total of 2,363 train stations were axed across Britain. As a child, Colin Price and his family referred to the S&D railway as the \"holiday line\", transporting them from Wells to Bournemouth for a seaside getaway. \"I was keen on railways anyway, so obviously I spent all my time with my head out the window, as you could in those days,\" he laughed. Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust On 5 March 1966 a coffin with the words \"S&D died today\" was loaded on to the very last train in a mock funeral to mark the service's demise Mr Price said the day the stone station was built, local residents \"thought it would be there forever, but it wasn't\". \"It was a very sad day,\" he recalled, as he watched the wooden sleepers being ripped from the ground. \"There was a lot of feeling around that it was the end of an era. \"The closest station would have been the main line at Castle Cary. It was getting further and further from anybody here, cutting us all off.\" John Strickland When the stone station closed, residents said they felt cut off from the world Elsewhere in Midford, tears welled in Peter Davis' eyes as he watched workmen tear down a legacy. \"My grandparents used to live just up the road, so I can remember it as a child,\" he said, conjuring a faint memory of roaring black locomotives. \"They took a couple of years to take the track up and I remember seeing them do it. It had a big effect on me. I cried at the time, I thought I'd lost something.\" Peter Davis said watching the train station fall into disrepair felt like a personal loss Eight years ago, Mr Davis began volunteering at the former station, cutting back overgrown vegetation and reinstalling old signs to \"see more clearly what it used to be like\". \"We lost a lot in the Beeching cuts, a lot of good railway lines,\" he said. \"But this is one I thought I could focus in on. It needed something doing with it.\" The site is now part of a popular walking and cycling path called the Two Tunnels Greenway, featuring the Devonshire Tunnel and the Combe Down Tunnel. Frank Tompson said life without the Two Tunnels network would be \"unimaginable\" Frank Tompson, chair of the Two Tunnels group, says the line was transformed into an active travel path in 2013, almost 50 years after the last trains rumbled through the stone arches. \"It was a case of uncovering both of the tunnels, keeping our fingers crossed they were in good condition, which luckily they were,\" he said. \"When you've got something like this on your doorstep, it's just a case of recycling what's already there. Bath now without the Two Tunnels would be unimaginable.\" In Shepton Mallet, the disused Windsor Hill tunnels are finding their purpose again as part of a 76-mile (122km) traffic-free circuit known as the Somerset Circle. When the passenger services stopped, the demolition trains arrived - destroying the Windsor Hill Tunnels so they could never be used again Gavin Mayall leads the Friends of Windsor Hill Tunnels group, a team of volunteers who \"dared to dream\" of reopening the route to the public. \"Probably about four years ago, the tunnel was inaccessible,\" he said. \"It was gated and there was scrap, fridges, tyres and all sorts just dumped here. \"A group of volunteers decided it was about time this amazing resource that had been lost for so many years was reopened to the public. \"The usage now is nothing short of remarkable. You build the paths and the people will come.\" However, the second tunnel still remains closed due to a rare bat colony nesting in its arches. The signal box, painted in the S&D colours, overlooks the former track at Masbury A disused signal box, originally built in 1874, was previously left to rot beside the former Masbury station before Joe Bourne snapped it up. He was in the process of putting his house on the market when he spotted the unique gem for sale. \"Most signal boxes were destroyed when they closed the line, or were vandalised or destroyed. I thought it had to be done,\" he said. \"It was a pile of rubble when I first moved here. I've never had a grand plan. I just saw the opportunity to buy it and I thought 'what a cool place, what a project'.\" Mr Bourne sensitively restored the building back to its former glory, painting it in the original S&D colours as a tribute to the lost relic. Rosie Craddock, lives in S&D railway viaduct with her family Rosie Craddock, lives in S&D railway viaduct with her family in Shoscombe. Her grandparents bought the land in the 80s following a long battle for planning permission. \"He [granddad] had the vision originally to make the arches into a house. \"Unfortunately he got too old to finish it, and my husband and I saw an opportunity. \"It's only when you get visitors like 'wow' you think, 'oh yeah actually, it is quite special',\" she added. Roger Burfitt described the S&D railway as a \"part of [the] community\" Roger Burfitt is acting chair of trustees at the S&D Railway Heritage Trust, who run public day trips along a mile-long (1.6 km) restored section of the railway in Midsomer Norton. The group of enthusiasts got together when the station was just days away from being demolished. \"They managed to save the day at literally the last minute,\" he explained. \"We are extremely fortunate because most of the other stations on the railway have either been demolished or become private residences.\" The station's signal box has been completely rebuilt to the original design, using components that have been rescued from other derelict signal boxes. \"It wasn't just an old railway, it served a purpose, it was part of a community. It fulfils a different role now,\" Mr Burfitt added fondly.",

Blaenavon Ironworks' Cast House was recently closed to the public after a visual display was vandalised and bricks thrown from the top of a tower. \"There are incidents of theft too at Blaenavon iron works,\" said Mr Berry. \"Lead from the roof was stolen, we replaced it, and it was stolen again. \"So, we now use a product which looks like lead but isn't and thankfully that has stayed on the roof.\" Windows to the under croft of Neath Abbey were smashed, and a Tudor exhibition vandalised Wales has one of the highest proportions of historic buildings in Europe - 30,100 buildings are listed. There are more than 4,000 scheduled monuments which include archaeological sites of national importance including Roman remains, burial mounds, castles, and bridges, with 400 registered historic parks and four world heritage sites. The consequences for deliberate damage to a scheduled monument range from fines to a prison sentence. Cadw Graffiti painted on the medieval masonry of the undercroft at St Davids Bishop's Palace What is heritage crime? Heritage crime refers to any illegal activity that harms historical assets. This includes: Theft of historic metal such as lead from church roofs Deliberate damage including graffiti or vandalism Unauthorised works on scheduled monuments Illegal metal detecting also known as \"nighthawking\" Anti-social behaviour, including littering, out of hours access or climbing on walls Rob Taylor says there needs to be education to prevent these crimes Rob Taylor, Wales' wildlife and rural crime co-ordinator, says the crimes are sometimes down to ignorance. \"People are coming to sites which they might not realise are ancient sites like burial grounds which can just be a grassy mound,\" he said. \"Areas like Gwent now have a special constable who is an archaeologist which is a fantastic addition to their team and we have police cadets involved patrolling these sites and education is really important to the public and the police. \"Everyone is aware of the problem but we need to look at how we can prevent it from happening in the first place.\" Bryn Celli Ddu passage tomb is one of the best known neolithic sites in Wales, but has seen graffiti and damage to the internal chamber Bryn Celli Ddu passage tomb on Anglesey, is one of the best known neolithic sites in Wales, dating back 5,000 years. It has recently seen graffiti and damage to the internal chamber stones. More than 40 marks were painted inside the passage and tomb, including fingerprints, handprints, diamond shapes and circles, and large symbols on the internal lintels. Ffion Reynolds, from Cadw, discovered the damage while planning an event. \"Every year we come to Bryn Celli Ddu to promote monuments for future generations of people to come and enjoy them, and while I was up here planning those events I went inside the chamber and discovered that it was covered in lots of paintings, more than maybe 40 or 50 marks in there, and it did feel like a bit of a bunker in there.\" Dr Reynolds said she believes education is key to preventing future vandalism. \"So one of the things we did as part of the project was we got permission from Cadw and worked with some of the young volunteers and we cleaned it off safely, but it was really good to involve these young volunteers because some of them were actually individuals that had been in trouble for graffiti, so in a sense this is the message, it's trying to get young people to understand the importance. \"A lot of them found the experience to be quite a privilege, so hopefully they went away and told their friends to make sure not to do this to other monuments across Wales.\" \"Leave nothing but a footprint and take nothing but a photograph\" says archaeologist Rhys Mwyn",

        "content": "Great Fire events to mark county's 'resilience' 5 September 2025 Share Save Alex Pope BBC News, Northamptonshire Share Save All Saints Church The Great Fire of Northampton occurred in 1675 A week-long series of free events is set to commemorate the 350th anniversary of a fire that devastated a town centre. In 1675, the Great Fire of Northampton destroyed 700 of 850 buildings and claimed 11 lives. Starting on Saturday, 13 September, events marking the anniversary are taking place including guided walks, music and theatre performances, and a main event in the Market Square the following Saturday. Art historian James Miller, who has spearheaded the project, said it was a chance to \"celebrate Northamptonshire's extraordinary resilience, civic pride and independent spirit\". The huge blaze was believed to have started from sparks from an open fire at a home on St Mary's Street and it quickly spread, with residents seeking refuge in the Market Square. Despite efforts to control it, prominent buildings including All Hallows Church were destroyed. Following a community-driven effort, the town raised  25,000 to fund reconstruction. A number of events have taken place in the past five months to commemorate what happened all those centuries ago, building up to this final week. Mr Miller said: \"The Great Fire of Northampton is a hugely significant moment in our local history and we have been thrilled to see so many people coming together in recent months to mark the 350th anniversary. \"This will be an opportunity for the county to come together to celebrate Northamptonshire's extraordinary resilience, civic pride and independent spirit. \"It is that character that shone through 350 years ago and is still very much in evidence today.\" Matt Crockett Music star and former Finedon vicar, Rev Richard Coles, is taking part in the week of commemorations The main event of the upcoming week will take place from 11:00-19:30 BST in the Market Square on 20 September, where a specially commissioned animation will premiere at 13:30 telling the story of the fire on a big screen. The film is the result of a project involving hundreds of local people answering the question: 'If Northampton burnt down again tomorrow, what would people save, what would people rebuild first and what would make it feel like our Northampton again?' Becky Carrier, of Northampton Film Festival, said: \"We're looking forward to showcasing everyone's work, as we come together as a community to commemorate this huge milestone in our town's proud history.\" There will also be an artisan market, live music, a performance from the Bach choir and displays from the police and fire service. Also on 20 September, a Service of Rededication will be held at All Saints' Church at 19:30 BST, where Rev Richard Coles - the former vicar of Finedon, Communards musician and Strictly Come Dancing contestant - will be a guest. A \"spectacular\" light show is due to be beamed on to All Saints' Church every night from 19:00, from 15 to 20 September. Fiori Musicali will perform an interpretation of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks at the church on the Thursday of that week. Father Oliver Coss, rector of All Saints, said: \"The memory of All Hallows' Church and its destruction in the Great Fire of Northampton serves as a reminder of the resilience of the town and its ability to recover and rebuild, even in the face of catastrophic events. \"The events will channel that community spirit and shine a light on the history and heritage that gives Northamptonshire such a proud identity.\" The Royal Household Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, came to Northampton in June to mark a year of commemorations Elsewhere, on Saturday 13 September, there will be Mystery Tours and guided walks from St Mary's Street through the town centre. The next day The Deco will host a performance called Northampton Remembers The Great Fire of 1675, from 16:30-18:30. From 15 September, Northampton Museum and Art Gallery will host an immersive mixed-media experience. Also from 15-17 September, the University of Northampton will hold an exhibition of artefacts loaned by Northamptonshire Archives Service. Then on 19, 20 and 21 September, Tipping Point - an art show by internationally renowned Luke Jerrams - will be in Hazel and Thoroughsale Woods in Corby, from 20:00-21:30. \"The show uses immersive light, smoke and sound to simulate the drama of a forest fire alongside a bespoke soundtrack created by Bafta and Ivor Novello award-winning composer Dan Jones, which includes the sounds of burning trees, whirring chainsaws, and fleeing animals, plus moving global testimonies from individuals who have experienced wildfires,\" organisers said.

        "content": "Captain Scott s famous polar shipwreck as never seen before 2 September 2025 Share Save Share Save Watch: Underwater footage shows the polar vessel colonised with sea life Rebecca Morelle, Alison Francis and Kevin Church BBC News Science One of the most famous polar shipwrecks has been filmed in detail on the sea floor for the first time. The Terra Nova carried Captain Scott and his men on their doomed expedition to reach the South Pole more than a century ago. The British party lost the race to the pole, and died on their return journey in 1912. The footage shows the Terra Nova colonised with sea life, but key features of the wooden ship are still visible including its wheel, winch and mast. Getty Images/Royal Geographical Society The Terra Nova is forever entwined in the tragic tale of Captain Scott and his men The wreck lies 170m down off the coast of Greenland. After the polar expedition with Scott, the ship continued in service and eventually sank in 1943 while carrying supplies to US bases during World War Two. The Terra Nova was discovered in 2012 by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, but the new expedition has been the first opportunity to record extensive footage of the wreck. \"To be able to see these significant parts of the wreck, it was truly awe inspiring,\" said Leighton Rolley, Science Systems Manager at REV Ocean. \"The wheel was sat there perfectly intact amongst the debris of the aft section of the wreck. \"When you think of the people who have stood there, manoeuvred the Terra Nova through ice, like Captain Scott  It was like, wow, if that ship's wheel could talk, it could tell an amazing history.\" The Terra Nova was one of the finest polar vessels of its time and sailed for 60 years. The ship was 57m (187ft) long with a wooden hull that was a metre thick in places to help it break through the sea ice. Captain Scott's men embarked to Antarctica in 1910. A comprehensive scientific programme was planned for the Terra Nova expedition - along with the goal of being the first to reach the South Pole. Scott, along with Edward Wilson, Henry Bowers, Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans, were attempting to make history. After trekking hundreds of miles, the British party reached the pole in January 1912, but they found they had been beaten by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen. Getty Images Captain Scott and his men reached the pole but realised others had got there first A black flag, planted by Amundsen, is now on display at the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in Cambridge along with other items from the Terra Nova. \"Their hearts must have sunk seeing this black flag against the whiteness of Antarctica,\" said David Waterhouse, curator of the polar museum at SPRI. The deflated British party began their arduous return journey to their base. But they encountered unusually bad weather, and Edgar Evans died after falling while descending a glacier. Several weeks later Captain Oates left the men's tent. His last words were recorded in Scott's journal: \"I'm just going outside and may be some time.\" He was never seen again. Scott, Bowers and Wilson continued on and made a final camp, but trapped by a freezing blizzard with dwindling supplies, all three perished. A search expedition discovered their last camp just 11 miles from a resupply depot that would have provided them with food and fuel. Getty Images The Terra Nova played a crucial role in breaking the news of their death. \"In January 1913, the Terra Nova arrived at Cape Evans in the Antarctic to pick up the shore party, and they were expecting to pick up Captain Scott and his pole party at the same time,\" explained Naomi Boneham, an archivist at SPRI. \"But when they arrived they found out the sad news.\" The ship's log records that the men had died from \"exposure and want\". The vessel sailed on to New Zealand, where the tragic end of the Terra Nova expedition was announced to the world.

        "content": "Historian seeks recognition for first English king 2 September 2025 Share Save Helen Burchell BBC News, Cambridgeshire Share Save Parker Library/Corpus Christi David Woodman with a 10th Century manuscript that shows Aethelstan's head bowed as he stands before Saint Cuthbert A University of Cambridge academic has joined calls for greater recognition of the first king of England. Aethelstan ruled England from 927 AD to 939 and united the kings of Wessex, Mercia, Northumberland and East Anglia/Danelaw under a single crown. He was also king of the Anglo Saxons from his coronation in 925, and was buried in Malmesbury Abbey in Wiltshire. David Woodman, a professor of history at Cambridge University who has written a new book about the king, said: As we approach the anniversaries of Aethelstan's coronation in 925 and the birth of England itself in 927, I would like his name to become much better known. He really deserves that.\" Aethelstan was the grandson of Alfred the Great and in 929 he conquered the last Viking kingdom, York, at the Battle of Brunanburh, making him the first Anglo-Saxon ruler of the whole of England. He died in Gloucester in 939 and was succeeded by his half-brother Edmund. Woodman, from Robinson College, said: \"There has been so much focus on 1066, the moment when England was conquered. \"It's about time we thought about its formation, and the person who brought it together in the first place.\" Prof Woodman said he blamed a lack of public relations for this. \"Aethelstan didn't have a biographer writing up his story. \"His grandfather, Alfred the Great, had the Welsh cleric Asser to sing his praises. \"And within decades of Aethelstan's death, a wave of propaganda ensured King Edgar became famous for reforming the church. This completely overshadowed Aethelstan's earlier revamping of learning and religiosity.\" Edgar was the son of Aethelstan's brother Edmund, was the great-grandson of Alfred and became king of all England in 959. Getty Images King Aethelstan's bones were buried at Malmesbury Abbey in Wiltshire Prof Woodman said some historians dismissed Aethelstan's status as England's first king on the basis that the kingdom fragmented soon after his death in 939 and the focus instead shifted to Edgar. \"Just because things broke down after Aethelstan's death doesn't mean that he didn't create England in the first place,\" he said. \"He was so ahead of his time in his political thinking, and his actions in bringing together the English kingdom were so hard-won, that it would have been more surprising if the kingdom had stayed together. \"We need to recognise that his legacy, his ways of governing and legislating, continued to shape kingship for generations afterwards.\" He added Aethelstan brought England together just as parts of continental Europe were fragmenting. \"Nobles across Europe were rising up and taking territory for themselves. \"Aethelstan made sure that he was well placed to take advantage of the unfolding of European politics by marrying a number of his half-sisters into continental ruling houses.\" Parker Library/Corpus Christi The 10th Century manuscript shows the king and a saint Prof Woodman, together with other historians including Tom Holland and Michael Wood, has been campaigning for greater public recognition of Aethelstan's creation of England in 927 AD.

The work has been carried out on Dereham Windmill, in Norfolk, to weatherproof deteriorating brick work and remove moss from the exterior. It was made derelict in 1937 and opened to the public in 2013 as a community exhibition centre hosting events and art exhibitions across five floors. Philippa Whittington, trustee of Dereham Windmill, said: \"I only moved to Dereham a couple of years ago and it's a good way of getting to know people and getting to know things that are going on and it's nice to see something that is used for the community and it is staffed entirely by volunteers.\" Maddy Jennings/BBC Philippa Whittington said repairs to the building will be ongoing with urgent repairs being carried out first Built in 1836 by millwright James Hardy for Michael Hardy, a miller and baker, it ceased work as a mill in 1937 and was left derelict more than a decade later. The building received grade II listed status in 1972 and was opened to the public in 2013. Tracey Lingfield The mill opened to the community for events and exhibitions in 2013 Previously it underwent a number of renovations including work on the sails and was boarded up for some time to keep it weatherproof after failed funding attempts. She said: \"We had a number of work we had to do in getting rid of the moss on the outside and making sure the windmill was waterproof because we were suffering from a lot of water coming in through the bricks that were deteriorating so we are very pleased at the work that has been done.\" Ms Whittington said the work will be carried out in phases, with the urgent repairs done first. She said repairs will remain ongoing due to money strains. \"The idea is to keep it looking as it was shortly after 1836 when it was built, so it's really maintaining that building and making sure it doesn't deteriorate too much. \"The bricks tend of deteriorate in the weather, we have to make sure we replace them from time to time.\" Surveys carried out also show work will need to be undertaken on the cap of the windmill too.

On Sunday, the site near Langport in Somerset will be open to public so that people can view the villa and archaeological findings for the first time. The site includes remains of an old Roman villa, a ritualistic horse burial and luxury items that were used by the occupants. Agata Socha-Paszkiewicz, regional manager at Thames Valley Archaeological Services South West, said the finds were \"quite a significant\". The people living in the villa complex were likely to have been a wealthy family Ms Socha-Paszkiewicz said: \"In the villa, there probably would have been extended family as well as servants and slaves at Roman times. \"We have surviving floors and an atrium and evidence of a mosaic, which means they were quite wealthy, upper middle class.\" She said they found fragments of fine glass and hair pins that suggest they were trading with places quite far away from Somerset. \"We have some personal hygiene objects too, like tweezers. They are different objects that can tell us what life was like, how far they traded,\" Ms Socha-Paszkiewicz said. Agata Socha-Paszkiewicz said the findings were \"quite significant\" She added that the most common items they found was pottery and animal bones, as well as more than 60 coins. However, the most interesting find was a buried horse, she said. The remains show it was buried on its side, with its legs arranged to look like it was still galloping. \"It usually would have been a ritual or spiritual act. That's quite spectacular and quite a rare find,\" Ms Socha-Paszkiewicz said. People will be able to see the horse grave as part of the open day on Sunday. Correction 3 September: This article was amended on 1 September to make clear that archaeologists uncovered a villa, rather than a village as originally reported. The article has also been amended to remove part of a quote from Agata Socha-Paszkiewicz, from Thames Valley Archaeological Services, as saying of the discovery \"we are looking at probably several thousand occupants\" because this was a misquote.

Saunders' Boathouse in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, was recognised by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport on the advice of Historic England. It was built around 1894 for pioneering boatbuilder and engineer Samuel Saunders whose connection to the building is marked with a blue plaque. Historic England described it as a rare surviving example of a late Victorian commercial boathouse on the non-tidal River Thames. Historic England Archive The boathouse was built in about 1894 for pioneering boatbuilder and engineer Samuel Saunders Sarah Gibson from Historic England said the listing \"celebrates the building's design and its origin as the early business premises of Samuel Saunders who became one of England's leading boatbuilders and engineers. Saunders commissioned the boathouse after the stretch of Thames nearby had grown more popular following the arrival of the railway in the 1840s. Jerome K Jerome's classic travelogue Three Men in a Boat, published in 1889, credited Goring and Streatley as \"charming places to stay\", the annual regatta was drawing large crowds and there was a boom in leisure boating. Historic England Archive Sarah Gibson at Historic England said the boatyard was a \"prominent local landmark\" Saunders offered boat building services and craft for hire from the boathouse which included the riverside wharf, a showroom and a manager's flat. The building, which faces both the riverside and High Street has had a variety of uses over time. Its showroom was leased to WHSmith and then to the Royal Mail for use as a sorting office and part of it currently houses a dental practice. Historic England Archive There was a boom in leisure boating in the area when Saunders commissioned the boathouse Samuel Edgar Saunders (1859 1933) At Goring he patented the Consuta boat building method, placing thin layers of wood together with a waterproofing material, stitched together with copper wire, creating a lightweight, tough hull that allowed for higher speeds In 1898 he built the steam launch Consuta as an umpiring boat for the Henley Royal Regatta, later used by the BBC for live TV commentary of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race In the early 20th Century he expanded his business to East Cowes on the Isle of Wight His company developed faster and lighter powerboats, flying boats, and aircraft Aircraft designer and manufacturer Sir Edwin Alliott Veron Roe invested in 1928, and the company became Saunders Roe, or Saro Its famous designs include Sir Malcolm Campbell's Bluebird K3 speedboat Source: Historic England",

The next time it will be possible to see the nearly 1,000-year-old work of art should be when it goes on display at the British Museum in September next year. However, the French art world is fiercely opposed to the project, with experts fearing the 70m-long (230ft) masterpiece is in far too delicate a state to be transported across the Channel. French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the loan when they met in London in July. The last few weeks have seen a big rise in visitor numbers at the Bayeux Museum ahead of its closure from 1 September. A new display area is being built for the tapestry, which will take at least two years. The closure   long planned   is what gave Macron the opportunity to perform his act of cultural diplomacy, committing France to loaning the tapestry to the British Museum for a year from next September. But that promise has triggered an outcry from many in the French art world. A petition   which describes the loan as a cultural crime   has drawn 60,000 signatures. What many opponents resent above all is the high-handed way they feel Macron decided to make his gesture to the UK, overriding the advice of specialists who say the vibrations inevitable in a long journey by road could cause irreparable damage.

He said: \"In this case, we will record as much as we can before it's lost and, hopefully in the near future, return to the site to excavate a wider area to fully understand the scale and nature of the monument in which the remains were buried, with its glorious vistas from the southernmost point of the British mainland.\" National Trust The National Trust says the remains will be sent to an osteoarchaeologist The National Trust said the remains were due to be sent to an osteoarchaeologist, a specialist in human remains, for detailed analysis.

Rot was found three years ago and became increasingly worse, leading to removal of the cap and the windmill's six sails in August 2024. The mill, which was built between 1878 and 1880, is one of just a handful still operating in northern Lincolnshire. It is hoped the six sails will be back on the mill in the next two to six weeks.

In the 19th century, the Chartists movement founded settlements in Snigs End and Lowbands, in Gloucestershire, as part of efforts to help working-class people satisfy the landholding requirement to vote. Over the years, Snig's End has fallen into disrepair and as a result has been nominated to be included in Historic England's Heritage at risk register for 2025. At a meeting on 11 August one resident reminded the council that Snigs End had been left to \"complete ruin\" leaving Lowlands as the best chartist site left which needs protecting. \"There are only five such settlements and this is the best one,\" they said. \"The Forest of Dean has already let the fourth one, Snig's End completely go to the wall   it's completely ruined. \"They've only got one chance left to keep one Chartist settlement going.\" Snigs End is considered at risk from development, alterations to the original Chartist cottages, and subdivision of the original plots, the Local Democracy Reporting Service was told. The council also said it is concerned about the condition of the closed Prince of Wales pub, which was built as a school for Snig's End, and the increase in traffic in the area. Carmelo Garcia Locals say Lowbands could be protected if the district council steps in And the real possibility of a new town with around 3,000 homes being built a stone's throw from Lowbands has sparked serious concerns among villagers that their heritage could also be \"completely ruined\". The meeting also heard that attempts to give Lowbands special protection as a conservation area had fallen on deaf ears at the District Council. Josh Wheeler from Redmarley Parish Council said: \"We've literally been knocking at their door and they've been keeping it firmly shut.\" The District Council has been approached for comment on the application for Snig's End to be considered by Historic England's heritage at risk register.

        "content": "Derelict fortress transformed into  3m party island 17 August 2025 Share Save Charlie Buckland BBC News Share Save Strutt & Parker The fortress did not even have running water when Mike Conner took it on Many dream of taking on a renovation project, something to transform and make your own. But for one former software company owner, the opportunity to bring back to life a derelict 19th Century Napoleonic fort brought with it more challenges than he had ever anticipated. Mike Conner, 52, snapped up Thorne Island near Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire for  555,000 in May 2017. The building, which was known for its parties under a previous owner, had been empty for 17 years, taking him about a year to bring it to a habitable state. Now equipped with 40 beds, four en-suite bathrooms and its own night club, the historic building has come a long way from having no running water, and is back on the market for  3m. \"Many have described it as a midlife crisis,\" Mr Conner joked. \"I really didn't know what I was getting myself into.\" Layered with history, the 100-man fort was originally built in the 1850s to protect the busy port of Milford Haven from French naval attacks. A proposal was first made in 1817 to fortify the island but it was not implemented until sometime after 1852. A date of 1854 has been carved above the island's entrance, according to the island's website. It was converted into a hotel in 1947 and hired out for birthday parties, weddings and stag parties, before being sold in 1999. By 2001 the building was bought by the Von Essen hotel group who intended to spend  4m to re-open the hotel, equipped with a cable car to allow access from the mainland. But it was largely abandoned when Mr Conner purchased the listed building, with the once-bustling party island left to grow over. Mike Conner Mike Conner bought the island back in 2017 and has devoted years to bringing it back to life \"There was no electric, no water, and any food or waste needed to come back off,\" he said. \"My wife was pretty cross when I first said I bought it, she said she would stay once it had a flushing loo, which is pretty reasonable.\" But Mr Conner did not anticipate the first flush would require cutting through 16ft (5m) of rock to get to the biodigester pump, ultimately costing him  200,000. Strutt & Parker Strutt & Parker The fortress now has 40 beds, four en-suite bathrooms and its own night club The 100-man fort was originally built in the 1850s to protect the busy port of Milford Haven from French naval attacks \"Wales has got some absolutely fabulous historic buildings that are in really sad states,\" said Mr Conner. The whole Thorne Island renovation process took nearly five years to get over the line, with six men living on the island for about four years while work was ongoing. Much of the equipment was brought in via helicopter, Mr Conner said, a process he described as \"incredibly hard\" given its location. He added getting materials was extremely difficult, but it was also a challenge for those who agreed to work on the project and live on site. \"Most people who joined the project, I still work with now,\" said Mr Conner. \"You just couldn't predict how many people want to help you.\" The men working on the island would spend stints of about two weeks on the island, unable to shower and covered in dust. \"They would charge their phones with a generator, and would have to have a dip in the sea for a wash. It was tough living,\" said Mr Conner. Mike Conner The island hosted its own festival for Mr Conner's 50th birthday, complete with a tight-rope performer Mr Conner, who trained as a design and technology teacher, said the design process excited him the most. He said he could not believe the Victorians could build something so magnificent, inspiring him to keep going. He added: \"A thousand men were working on it for two years, it was built in the same way as Stonehenge.\" \"I felt my task was really modernising it,\" Mr Conner said, adding the renovation was a task of figuring out how the new would work with the old. \"It almost feels like a tribute to their hard work and you're just really building the last little bit on top of what was already an awesome, bomb-proof construction.\" The island has \"seen everything\", according to Mr Conner, from 80-people parties to \"millpond serenity\". With \"no neighbours to upset\", the island hosted its own festival for Mr Conner's 50th birthday, complete with a tight-rope performer across the picturesque courtyard. \"People who come for a weekend are surprised when I hand them a bin liner and say it needs to come back off with them - but no-one comes here to collect the bins.\" Mike Conner The fortress, built in the 1850s, was intended to protect Pembrokeshire from French naval attacks As a former CEO, Mr Conner described his time on the island as \"incredible\" as he had to let go of everyday routines. \"We all often live by a calendar of scheduled meetings, but the island is the complete opposite - it's off grid. It feels real time, it feels like living.\" Time stops on the island, Mr Conner said, adding that with something always going on, people tended to put their phones away. \"I think that's what makes Thorne a special place, that people are present.\" Mike Conner Thorne Island operated as a hotel from 1947 to 1999, hosting weddings, hen and stag parties and birthdays Originally from Gloucestershire, Mr Conner does not live on the island but as the primary contractor spent a lot of time there during the renovation process. He initially juggled running his business alongside the venture, but sold his software company two years ago. \"It was quite cathartic for me to have this parallel life of complete chaos, which particularly through Covid was quite awesome.\" The project also lifted the lid on Mr Conner's personal heritage too, as it was not until he got the keys did he discover he is in fact a quarter Welsh, as his mum grew up at Upton Castle, Pembroke Dock. Mike Conner The island can host about 800 people, Mr Conner said Speaking of the island's future, Mr Conner said he hoped its new owner enjoys it as much as he has, but that it also has huge potential to operate as a tourist attraction, or play host to \"the most unbelievable raves\". Mr Conner said he envisaged the site offering an \"unbelievable 24-hour experience\", with the potential to host about 800 people. \"I think that would be great for Wales, but I'm not in that industry and I don't know how that works. \"If it was generating revenue, and creating jobs and sustaining itself, that would be a great outcome. \"The more people who could use it the better, as it's got to be one of the most interesting buildings in the area,\" he added. Mr Conner said more people needed to come to Wales and see what is there. \"It's a blank canvas, and the next owner can work out what it's for,\" he said, speaking of the island. \"But if there are any events there, I would crawl over broken glass to get there.\"",

The maritime miniatures were uncovered while staff at Leeds Industrial Museum were assessing and cleaning their collection of historic model ships. They are now on display as part of Engineery, an exhibition about the history of engineering and inventors. Leeds Museums and Galleries' curator of industrial history John McGoldrick said the art of model ship making was as \"old as shipbuilding itself\". He said: \"Each of the model ships in our collection has been made at a unique and very different moment in history, but what unites them is the ingenuity and attention to detail, which has gone into capturing each minute feature. \"That level of dedication and commitment speaks volumes about how impressive these ships were and how much they inspired and motivated each model maker to reach such incredible feats of creativity.\" Leeds Industrial Museum A model of the RMS Queen Elizabeth, once the biggest passenger ship ever built, is also on display The model bone ship carved more than 200 years ago is a replica of a 19th Century warship. It is believed to be an example of the type carved by French captives in British prisons and aboard ships during the Napoleonic Wars. Using leftover bone, the prisoners were also known to employ hair, clothing and jewellery in a model, which normally took a prisoner years to complete. Other ships in the museum collection include wool clipper Cromdale, built in Glasgow in 1891. After narrowly escaping disaster on her maiden voyage when she was hit by 300ft high icebergs, she later ran aground in thick fog, ploughing into cliffs off the coast of Cornwall, where the wreck is visible today. Several members of the crew died, including one who was reportedly eaten by a shark in Montevideo Bay. Also part of the collection is a scale replica of the RMS Queen Elizabeth. More than a 1.5m long, the model is a tribute to the much larger original cruise liner, which was once the biggest passenger ship ever built.",

        "content": "The battle to rescue an historic pub from ruin 17 August 2025 Share Save Alex McIntyre BBC News, West Midlands Share Save Historic England The Golden Lion pub was dismantled and moved to Cannon Hill Park in 1911 In the grounds of a 19th Century park lies an old, derelict, timber-framed pub which has had to withstand both the passage of time and adversity. Almost destroyed in the English Civil Wars, it was then dismantled and relocated before, in the 20th Century, almost being burnt down by suffragettes. The story of the Grade II listed Golden Lion in Birmingham is one of a \"rare and remarkable\" survival, conservationists say, and many believe the community has a duty to rescue it from ruin. Leaders of the restoration project received a boost in August after Historic England awarded them  344,265 to make vital repairs. The Golden Lion was one of 37 heritage sites in England - and four in the West Midlands - to receive funding, which also included the Bethesda Methodist Chapel in Stoke-on-Trent - known as the \"cathedral of the Potteries\". With the pub, which was originally based in Deritend High Street, its early history is \"shrouded in mystery\" though some of its timbers date back to the 15th Century, the Birmingham Conservation Trust says. The building was rebuilt between 1616 and 1644, thought to be as a result of damage during a Royalist attack on Birmingham in the Civil Wars era. Historic England The Golden Lion has deteriorated over the last 20 years Since then, the Golden Lion has been used as a pub, culler's house, six small homes, a scrap shop and a rangers' hut, the trust said. It was dismantled by the Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeological Society in 1911 before it was rebuilt at its current location in Cannon Hill Park, where it was used as a cricket pavilion. During the votes for women protests, it was badly damaged in an arson attack carried out by suffragettes in 1912. Sarah Hayes Sarah Hayes, pictured with a visitor at the site, said the building was in \"desperate\" need of repair Sarah Hayes, museum and trust director at the conservation trust, said: \"It's a rare and remarkable survival of a timber-framed building in Birmingham, one that has stood the test of time and survived beyond all odds.\" But the building has stood empty and unused for 20 years, falling into a dilapidated state, with scaffolding currently surrounding the site. The trust has been working with Birmingham City Council to try and bring it back into community use, though the grant from Historic England, a spokesperson said, would make the site secure and watertight but not yet usable. The repair work will include fixing the roof, chimneys, walls, floors, windows and doors, as well as adding French doors to the rear before the scaffolding is removed. Ms Hayes said it was \"our turn\" to help the much-loved building in \"desperate\" need of help. \"In many ways it feels like the last chance for us to act before its condition becomes beyond repair,\" she added. Historic England Bethesda Methodist Chapel was known as the \"cathedral of the Potteries\" Meanwhile in Stoke-on-Trent, charity Re-Form Heritage said it was \"delighted and grateful\" to receive  521,737 of funding for its work to rejuvenate Bethesda Methodist Chapel in Hanley. The Grade II* listed building on Albion Street, Hanley, was first built in 1798, according to the Friends of Bethesda Chapel. At first, it seated 600 people but was deemed to be too small in 1813, so the back wall was removed and the building extended to fit 1,000 people. As the \"fire of Methodism\" grew in the Potteries, the Friends of Bethesda Chapel said it was once again judged to be too small in 1819 so the extension was pulled down and replaced. The chapel reopened to worshippers in 1820 and was \"full to excess\" with about 3,000 people in attendance. Historic England said the chapel stood as a \"testament to the power and influence of the Methodist Church\" in 19th Century Stoke-on-Trent. Re-Form Heritage The chapel was extended on two occasions due to a growing number of worshippers Since its closure in 1985, the Friends of Bethesda Chapel and Historic Chapels Trust have been maintaining the site. Conservation specialists Re-Form Heritage have taken control of the efforts to bring the building back into use. The grant will go towards repairing plasterwork, timber panelling, staircases, east lobby and ceiling coving, a spokesperson said. The charity said the renovated site would \"provide a more attractive, comfortable and accessible space\". Under the plans, the building will be used as a mixed-use space in the future, housing creative arts education specialist Pinc College and feature exhibition and performance space. Re-Form Heritage chief executive Alasdair Brooks said: \"The funds will allow us to move forward with bringing the much-loved Cathedral of the Potteries back into community use. \"We're excited at being able to progress our work at this important Grade II* listed building over the coming months.\"",

        "content": "Exploring the catacombs which lie under a city 16 August 2025 Share Save Elliot Ball BBC News, West Midlands Share Save Birmingham City Council Archives A catacomb at Key Hill Cemetery opened in 1836 and was Birmingham's first The fact that a labyrinth of catacombs lies beneath one of the UK's biggest cities may surprise many. Rome or Paris could spring to mind for their underground chambers but Birmingham? But it is true - the UK's second city once housed more than 500 bodies in large, private vaults, dug out underground and used until the middle of the 20th Century. The first location to house them opened in 1836 at Key Hill Cemetery in the city's Jewellery Quarter before nearby Warstone Lane Cemetery opened 12 years later. Tour guide Richard Beardall said, at the time, the vaults cost up to  30 - about  3,000 in today's money. They were inspired by concepts across the continent before the British climate put an end to them in the late 1950s. \"The idea for the catacombs came from Rome where the bodies would dry out and mummify but, with the British climate, the bodies would instead go mouldy and smelly,\" Mr Beardall said. \"The coffins were metal-lined and supposed to be sealed but they weren't, because they tended to explode due to the gasses that built up in them. \"You can imagine a small room with 10 bodies decaying in them wasn't very pleasant. \"The idea was to go and see granny's coffin and go to polish the brass. \"It was a nice idea but, due to the practicalities, people just didn't like the idea of it.\" Heritage England A vault for a family cost about  30 each, according to Mr Beardall The 56-year-old is the principal tour guide for the two catacombs with a voluntary group, the Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries, formed in 2004. \"We primarily keep the place clean and tidy, raise funds to restore headstones, as well as reconnect families with their ancestors,\" Mr Beardall said. \"The responsibility [for the cemeteries] is with the council but we work very closely with them.\" The Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries The Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries maintain both cemeteries Describing what lies beneath the surface in Key Hill's catacomb, Mr Beardall said: \"Key Hill has a long linear arrangement but with a curve at each end so look like an elongated 'S'. \"They are also two-tiered but the lower level is below ground level and is no longer accessible or visible. \"There is a small interior section in a T-shaped tunnel. This is accessible and we hold tours on our open days.\" The Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries Each vault was for one family and could house about 10 bodies, according to Mr Beardall In contrast, he explained Warstone Lane's catacomb was below a now-demolished church in a semi-circular arrangement, on two levels. \"There would be a gate of wrought iron, possibly with glass backing and coffins would have been visible to all visitors to the cemetery,\" he said. \"Sadly these have now all been bricked up. \"A number [of vaults] were full while the cemetery was in operation so the gate would have been removed and a memorial fixed to seal the opening.\" Heritage England The catacombs at Warstone Lane were on two levels and tunnelled beneath a now-demolished church Both catacombs stopped being used in the late 1950s when they were no longer profitable and were bought by Birmingham City Council. Asked why it was important to preserve the Key Hill and Warstone Lane, Mr Beardall explained: \"Key Hill is a Grade II* listed cemetery because of its age and the people that are in there. \"We have the major founding fathers of Birmingham in the two cemeteries. \"It's important that we honour them and keep their final resting places intact.\" Key Hill in particular houses some famous names including Marie Bethell, claimed to be the country's first female reporter, along with Alfred Bird, the inventor of baking powder and egg-free custard and former politician Joseph Chamberlain.

        "content": "How a 'moth-eaten rag' became a war memorial 16 August 2025 Share Save Katy Prickett BBC News, Cambridgeshire Share Save The Long Shop The union jack is the centrepiece of a memorial made to remember the men of the 4th Battalion who died while prisoners of the Japanese A small coastal town is home to an unusual World War Two war memorial created by soldiers in memory of comrades who died while prisoners of war (POW). It was made by men from the 4th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment, who were captured at the fall of Singapore in 1942. They spent more than three years as slave labourers for the Japanese army, much of it at Chungkai camp in Thailand. The centrepiece of the memorial in Leiston, Suffolk, is a union jack, used in the camp during funeral services and brought home by Corp Hermie Bailey after he and the other survivors were finally liberated. In 1952, the veterans transformed the \"moth-eaten rag\" into a tribute to the POWs of the 4th Battalion who died and to mark the 10th anniversary of their capture. \"Sometimes people just refer to it as a flag, but it's not just a flag - the flag is just the centrepiece of a very, very interesting and unusual war memorial,\" said Taff Gillingham, chairman of the Friends of the Suffolk Regiment. Norfolk Museums Service Men from Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire regiments joined other prisoners of war and slave labour to toil on the Burma to Thailand railway In 1942, the 4th Battalion was among many Allied divisions rushed to defend Singapore, in the wake of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour. After fierce fighting but against impossible odds, the British, Australian and Indian forces were ordered to surrender. Somehow the 11ft by 6ft (3.3m by 1.8m) flag went with the men of the 4th Battalion when they were transferred to Chungkai camp, said Mr Gillingham. This was a POW camp used during the construction of the infamous Burma-Thailand Railway, and today it is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery. About 13,000 Allied prisoners of war died during the railway project, plus an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 civilians, according to the commission. Mr Gillingham said the 4th and 5th battalions of the Suffolk Regiment were about 2,000 strong when they disembarked at Singapore in 1942, but more than a third of them had died by the end of the war. The POWs were allowed to build a little wooden chapel at Chungkai for church services, where the flag rested on its altar. \"And every time one of the soldiers died, it was used for the funeral service,\" Mr Gillingham said. \"Starved, beaten and executed for the slightest misdemeanours - the thing that inspires me is their resilience and their ingenuity, making medicines from plants that they'd find in the jungle, for example.\" The Long Shop Every year on VJ Day (Victory over Japan), the people of Leiston remember the men from the town who never came back, said historian Taff Gillingham Every aspect of the memorial has a specific link to the 4th Battalion, a territorial unit which recruited from the Leiston area. Mr Gillingham said: \"The frame is just as interesting [as the flag], in that it's made from wood salvaged from Southwold Pier and the metal frame it sits on was made by the engineering works of Garretts, the engineering works in Leiston, so it was a proper local project. \"And the colours behind the flag mean something too - they are the colours of the Pacific Star, the medal that all the Far East prisoners of war were given.\" Today, it is owned by the Friends of the Suffolk Regiment and is on long-term loan to the town's Long Shop Museum. When the men of the 4th Battalion were liberated at the end of the war, many, including Corp Bailey, continued to serve in the territorials for years, with weekly training and annual camps. Underneath the memorial is a plaque which describes it as \"a moth-eaten rag on a worm-eaten pole\". It also records how the union jack was \"hoisted to the top of the pole in the camp by the men of the battalion who survived three years of living hell\". Mr Gillingham said: \"It's often said to be the only war memorial based on an artefact brought back from the field, and it's certainly the only one I can think of, but it's a lovely thing because it has a direct connection with the place, and the people, with those who died.\" A service to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day and the end of World War Two will be held at the memorial at 10:30 BST.",

Wing Commander Cuthbert \"Cubby\" Lander from Northumberland led the 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment at the Battle of Meiktila in March 1945 and was killed aged 30 during a night-time patrol. His pivotal role in the battle was remembered with an annual dinner at the regiment's headquarters, RAF Honington, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Wing Cdr Lander's niece Penny Fell, 81, said: \"It's absolutely times like this VJ Day milestone that we should be remembering the sacrifices that war calls for. \"And - both for the regiment and our uncle - where the sacrifice has been great and the contribution significant, there isn't a shelf life on honour or gratitude.\" VJ Day stands for Victory over Japan Day and commemorates 15 August 1945 when Japan surrendered, bringing the Second World War to a complete end. Fell family handout Penny Fell (left) and her late sister Juliet Francis were invited to the RAF Regiment's annual dinner in honour of their uncle in 2020 The Battle of Meiktila was both a significant milestone in the reconquest of Burma by Allied forces from Japan and one of \"the greatest and proudest battle honours\" for the newly-formed regiment, said the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund. \"The unusual thing about Lander is he was a wing commander, but he was leading a clearance patrol of the airfield when he died, partly because they'd lost so many officers and also because he was a man of action who the troops looked up to terrifically,\" said Warrant Officer Mac MacDonald, 60, manager of the RAF Regiment Heritage Centre. \"Not many other wing commanders would have done so or been able to - and in other circumstances, he would have been awarded some kind of medallic recognition,\" WO MacDonald added. Fell family handout The wing commander - known as Bill in the RAF - married during the war and his widow Eileen remained close to the family The capture of the important command and supply centre at Meiktila was crucial to the plan of General Bill Slim - who led the 14th Army in the Burma campaign - to prevent the Japanese army from organising effective action. The 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment had been set up in 1942 to provide a ground defence force for the air force and its men had the specialist skills needed to defend Meiktila's airstrips. Mrs Fell said: \"Slim - commander of the 14th Army - saw that morale and supplies were the two things they needed to beat the legendarily fierce Japanese fighters and the airfields were crucial to his strategy of getting men and supplies to the places they needed to be.\" The Japanese army rushed in reinforcements to besiege the town, desperate to recapture Meiktila. Two runways could not be held at night, so Japanese patrols would move in under darkness and establish themselves on the airstrips. The 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment gunners had to clear the airstrips every day, before essential supply, casualty evacuation and fighter aircraft could land. Fell family handout After his father died, the Lander family moved to Kirkley, just north of Newcastle, where Cuthbert started school (front row far right) Wing Cdr Lander was responsible for coordinating the actions of the 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment squadrons and flights [platoons] and often led night patrols. In his diary, he wrote: \"Mortars and snipers gave us hell and it took an hour to get our casualties clear. \"Bullets were flying in all directions which didn't make our task pleasant... not a man relaxed his efforts.\" Lander and his runner, Leading Aircraftman Dakers, were shot dead on 24 March. WO MacDonald said: \"The capture of Meiktila was an essential part of Gen Slim's plan to beat the Japanese and (if they had not retained it) the rest of the campaign would have been very difficult and very different. \"People talk about the battles of Kohima and Imphal as the turning points in the Burma campaign, but the thing that cemented those achievements was the battle for Meiktila.\" Air Historical Branch RAF Crown Copyright A newspaper in March 1945 reported the 1307 Wing HQ RAF Regiment were using a captured Japanese foxhole as a shower, featuring Wing Cdr Lander (right) Wing Cdr Lander was the youngest of seven and born in Northumberland, where his father was a coachman on an estate at Simonburn near Hexham. His childhood was one of \"considerable poverty\" after his father died when he was four, said Mrs Fell, who lives near Cardiff. She is too young to remember \"Uncle Cubby\", but was brought up on stories of his charisma and sense of fun and the loss has been remembered down the generations. The family remained close to his widow Eileen who never remarried, and Mrs Fell chose Cuthbert as the middle name for one of her sons. \"By 1942, he joined the RAF Regiment as a pilot officer and it's quite something to go from joining a regiment and becoming a wing commander that fast, even with dead man's shoes,\" she said. Air Historical Branch RAF Crown Copyright In a letter of condolence to his widow, Air Vice Marshal Vincent praised Wing Cdr Lander's \"wonderful leadership\" In 1990, Leading Aircraftman Dennis Leftley remembered \"there was a feeling of great loss that day [when Wing Cdr Lander died] - he was a great bloke to the lads\". Mrs Fell said: \"Afterwards, another of Cubby's men described him as 'the bright star that shone in the darkness of Meiktila'. \"He paid the ultimate sacrifice for a very important cause and there's just me and one nephew left alive now, so this is our last shout to say how wonderful it would be if he could be remembered for what he has contributed.\"",

        "content": "VJ Day: The padre, the medic and the secret radio 15 August 2025 Share Save Katy Prickett BBC News, Cambridgeshire Share Save Ely Museum Returning prisoners of war, led by John Beckett, marching past Ely's war memorial in November 1945 The end of World War Two 80 years ago meant liberation for three men who were \"beacons of humanity and resistance to evil\". Noel Duckworth, George Easingwood and John Beckett were captured with the 2nd Battalion The Cambridgeshire Regiment at the fall of Singapore in February 1942. They were a chaplain whose courage prevented a massacre; a sergeant who tirelessly cared for the starving and injured; and a captain who created a hidden radio to provide morale-boosting news updates. \"They found themselves in this unimaginably awful situation and did not give up or give in to selfishness - it's an incredible story,\" said Felix Jackson, from Ely Museum. The 2nd Battalion was a territorial division, \"a unit imbedded in the local Ely population, quite often it was sons following fathers,\" said Mr Jackson. In 1941, they were heading to India for garrison duty, when the attack on Pearl Harbour took place and the ship they were on was rushed to Singapore. After fierce fighting but against impossible odds, the British, Australian and Indian forces were ordered to surrender. The Cambridgeshire Regiment was about 1,900-strong when it reached Singapore, but by 1945, 784 officers and men had died fighting or as prisoners. The conditions the Japanese Army inflicted upon the prisoners of war (POWs) have since become a by-word for brutality and cruelty, while millions of civilians also died in the South East Asian countries the army occupied. The padre who 'used his charisma' Cambridgeshire Regiment Research Trust Chaplain Noel Duckworth pictured in late 1945. He rowed for Great Britain in the 1936 Olympic Games Chaplain Noel Duckworth (1912-1980) loved rowing - and the sport would go on to save his life. At 5ft 2in (1.6m), the vicar's son from Yorkshire coxed for his college at the University of Cambridge, for the university boat club - and for Great Britain during the 1936 Berlin Olympics, said Mr Jackson. By the outbreak of World War Two he was a Church of England priest and he joined the 2nd Battalion as its padre - the name given to Army chaplains. As Singapore fell, field hospitals were being overrun and the injured were being executed, so the order went out that it was every man for himself. \"Amazingly, Royal Army Medical Corps personnel elect to stay behind and look after the wounded and Noel Duckworth sees it as his duty to do the same,\" said Mr Jackson, co-founder of the Cambridgeshire Regiment Research Trust. The group he was with was captured and the order to kill was about to be given. The padre's story featured on the TV programme This is Your Life in 1959 Mr Jackson said: \"Noel steps forward and starts berating the Japanese officer and everyone around him, giving them a proper parade-ground telling off. \"There's a moment of hesitation and the officer recognises Noel from his rowing days - the Japanese had a rowing team at the Olympics - and, according to multiple reports, this stops the massacre, all because he stood up and did what he could.\" This episode set the pattern for the way he behaved during his years of captivity, paying the price with \"incredibly severe beatings\" for standing up for his fellow POWs, said Mr Jackson. \"He would use his charisma to trade with the guards for food or medical supplies - everyone speaks so highly of him as this remarkable chap, getting up to a little bit of mischief,\" he added. After the war he worked in Ghana, before returning to Cambridge to become chaplain of the newly founded Churchill College. The selfless medic Ely Museum Ely's Sgt George Easingwood (1919-1987) was awarded the British Empire Medal for his bravery and devotion as a medic, which saved many of the prisoners \"George Easingwood's story is another one of moral courage, he is caring from the off,\" said Mr Jackson. At the time of capture, the grocer's assistant from Ely was an acting medical sergeant, triaging patients alongside a doctor. He was initially held at Changi Prison before being sent to join the POWs toiling relentlessly as slave labour while building the Burma to Thailand railway. They were also expected to work on docks, airfields, in coalmines, shipbuilding yards, steel and copper works. So in 1944, Sgt Easingwood was among thousands of Allied POWs crammed into unmarked and disease-riddled \"hell ships\", sent to become slave labour in Japan. Ely Museum He was selfless in his care of the men he was with, who were suffering from tropical diseases and malaria, malnutrition and torture, said Mr Jackson Mr Jackson said: \"He is sent to Tokyo knowing that when the Allied invasion comes, they're all going to be killed - except the atomic bombs are dropped and the war is over.\" On his return home, he was nominated for a British Empire Medal by fellow-survivors. \"The citation talks about the incredible care he showed during a terrible cholera outbreak in 1943 and how he looked after 750 men during the voyage to Japan, despite suffering from [tropical disease] beri-beri and marked malnutrition, while refusing to rest when his medical officer said he was too ill to work,\" said Mr Jackson. Sgt Easingwood remained in Ely for much of the rest of his life, marrying and staying active in a Far Eastern Prisoner of War (FEPOW) club until his death. Saved by a Rolex Ely Museum John Beckett was a young captain when he was captured, but on liberation went on to become a colonel and is seen here with Queen Elizabeth II in 1955 \"Within four months of capture, John Beckett comes up with a plan to scavenge whatever machinery and electronics they can to create a rudimentary radio,\" said Mr Jackson. \"He knew there was huge personal risk, if the radio was found he risked beatings, torture and probable execution - but morale is suffering and he felt the best way to help that is to get hold of news about the war.\" Capt Beckett (1914 to 1987) was a solicitor in Ely before the war, who had followed his uncle Lt Col Archer and taken a commission in the Cambridgeshire Regiment. \"He described the absolute shock of being told to surrender and within a few weeks he was getting a bit itchy and keen to push back so comes up with the idea of making a radio - it's this quiet resistance that's quite remarkable,\" said Mr Jackson. Ely Museum Capt Beckett would seek out men from the Royal Corps of Signals to help create a much smaller radio (above) which remained in use until mid-1944 The initial radio was hidden in the latrine's roof, but it was too big to be portable so over time, a radio was developed small enough to fit into his 8in by 6in (20cm by 15cm) water bottle. Captain Beckett was the one listening to the updates and writing them down. Mr Jackson said: \"There was one occasion, where a Japanese sentry stumbles across him doing this, works out what is going on, but see his fancy Rolex watch and takes that in exchange for not reporting him.\" He also kept a secret list in his bible of the names of the men who went missing or died - or got moved into different work groups - as a record for when the war ended. On his return to Ely, he married, remained in the territorials, and ended up becoming its commanding officer. Ely Museum A group of Allied prisoners of war celebrating after liberation Mr Jackson said: \"They were such remarkable men and it's important we remember them because they were people from the communities we live in now. \"A vicar, a grocer's assistant and a solicitor - people who risked everything to help those around them and are beacons of humanity and resistance to evil.\" Follow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "content": "Why does a Bronze Age hoard have a silvery 'glow'? 16 October 2025 Share Save Giancarlo Rinaldi South Scotland reporter Share Save NMS Initial conservation work has revealed the \"exceptionally rare\" silver-coloured objects Initial conservation work has revealed \"exceptionally rare\" silver-coloured items in a hoard of Bronze Age artefacts unearthed by a metal detectorist in the Borders. The Peebles Hoard, which had lain undisturbed for 3,000 years before it was discovered in 2020, was acquired by National Museums Scotland (NMS) last year. It comprises more than 500 unusual bronze and organic objects and components, many \"without archaeological parallel anywhere in the world\". NMS senior curator of prehistory Dr Matthew Knight said: \"The Peebles Hoard is truly a one-of-a-kind discovery, and I have never seen anything like the stunning, silver-coloured finish of these Bronze Age objects. They almost glow.\" NMS The true colour of many items was unclear prior to the conservation work The hoard has been described as one of the most significant ever found in the country. Dating from between 1,000 and 800BC, it was allocated to NMS under the Treasure Trove system, with a payment made to the detectorist Mariusz Stepien who found it. NMS said the defining technological characteristic of the Bronze Age was the widespread use and production of bronze - an alloy of copper and tin that is usually a deep golden colour. However, conservation of the Peebles Hoard has revealed rare silver-coloured objects from an era when silver was unknown. Crown Copyright Hundreds of pieces were discovered by a metal detectorist in 2020 Analysis has revealed the colour is the result of high levels of tin on the surface. This is thought to be the product of a deliberate enrichment technique by highly-skilled craftspeople. The bronze objects emerged from the earth encrusted with earth and green copper patina - a film produced by oxidation After months of careful preparatory work to stabilise, assess and document the material in the hoard, conservators are painstakingly removing thousands of years of dirt and corrosion to reveal the \"spectacular lustre\" of the original surface. Duncan McGlynn It has been estimated conservation work will take three years to complete It is estimated that it will take three years to complete the conservation work on the discovery. Bethan Bryan, conservator at NMS, said: \"Working on the conservation of the Peebles Hoard is a rare privilege and definitely a career highpoint. \"As well as removing dirt and corrosion, it is essential that we preserve as much precious organic material as possible for future research. \"Getting to this point has been a challenging and incredibly time-intensive process, but the moment the silvery surface began to emerge was magical, a secret revealed after 3,000 years.\" NMS The items are estimated to have lain undisturbed for 3,000 years",

        "content": "The Egyptologist and former minister of antiquities will be the first Arab to lead the UN s cultural organisation. The board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has nominated Egypt s Khaled el-Enany, an academic and former minister of tourism and antiquities, as its next head, before the organisation s general conference next month. If confirmed, el-Enany, a professor of Egyptology at Cairo s Helwan University, would become the first Arab director-general of the organisation, which oversees the UN s handling of cultural heritage, alongside international cooperation in other areas, including science and education. The former minister campaigned widely for the role, which was also contested by Firmin Edouard Matoko of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabriela Ramos of Mexico, who withdrew from the race earlier this year. The decision by the board, which represents 58 of the agency s 194 member states, is expected to be finalised at a meeting of UNESCO s general assembly in Uzbekistan next month. The organisation s next leader will replace France s former Minister of Culture Audrey Azoulay, who has served in the role since 2017. Azoulay notably helped lead a high-profile effort to rebuild the ancient Iraqi city of Mosul after it was devastated during fighting between the ISIL (ISIS) armed group and combined US and Iraqi forces. El-Enany s nomination comes as the Paris-based UN body continues to face political challenges, including in its work of choosing which cultural heritage sites to help preserve from threats including wars, pollution and climate change.  The organisation is also set to face an 8 percent funding cut at the end of 2026, when the United States again formally withdraws its membership, along with its funding. It will be the second time that the Trump administration has pulled the US out of the UN cultural organisation in protest at its members  decision to admit the State of Palestine as a member in 2011. The State of Palestine is also a Permanent Observer State member of the UN General Assembly, where more than 80 percent of member states now back its full membership. Explaining the US decision to withdraw again, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce claimed that allowing Palestine to remain a member of UNESCO had  contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organisation . Israel left UNESCO at the end of 2018. The organisation has been remotely monitoring damage to cultural heritage sites in the Gaza Strip during Israel s war, and says it has verified damage to a total of 110 sites since October 7, 2023, including 13 religious sites, 77 buildings of historical or artistic interest, three depositories of moveable cultural property, nine monuments, one museum and seven archaeological sites. El-Enani, 54, worked earlier in his career as a tour guide at ancient Egyptian sites, earned a doctorate in France and became a famed Egyptologist before serving in government. He was minister of antiquities and, later, tourism, under Egypt s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi from 2016 to 2022. El-Sisi welcomed the news of el-Enani s nomination, calling it a  historic achievement that shall be added to Egypt s diplomatic and cultural record and to the achievements of the Arab and African peoples . During his tenure in government, el-Enani oversaw the start of mega-tourism projects, including the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo, the Jewish Temple and multiple ancient discoveries that helped revive the country s battered tourism sector. He is expected to focus on UNESCO s cultural programmes, and has pledged to continue UNESCO s work to fight anti-Semitism and religious intolerance, according to The Associated Press news agency.",

        "content": "The newly discovered tombs are believed to date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period. Archaeologists in drought-hit Iraq have discovered 40 ancient tombs after water levels in the country s largest reservoir declined, according to an antiquities official. The tombs, believed to be more than 2,300 years old, were unearthed at the edges of the Mosul Dam reservoir in the Khanke region of Duhok province in the country s north.  So far, we have discovered approximately 40 tombs,  Bekas Brefkany, the director of antiquities in Duhok and leader of the archaeological work at the site, said on Saturday. His team surveyed the area in 2023 but spotted only parts of a few tombs. They were able to work on the site only when water levels dropped  to their lowest  this year, Brefkany said.  Drought allows us to do excavation work  In recent years, archaeologists have uncovered ruins dating back thousands of years in the same area, as a result of droughts that have plagued Iraq for five consecutive years.  The droughts have a significant impact on many aspects, like agriculture and electricity. But, for us archaeologists   it allows us to do excavation work,  Brefkany said. The newly discovered tombs are believed to date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period, according to Brefkany. He added that his team is working to excavate the tombs to transfer them to the Duhok Museum for further study and preservation, before the area is submerged again.  Iraq, which is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, has been facing rising temperatures, chronic water shortages and year-on-year droughts. Authorities have warned that this year has been one of the driest since 1933 and that water reserves were down to only 8 percent of their full capacity. They also blame upstream dams built in neighbouring Iran and Turkiye for dramatically lowering the flow of the once-mighty rivers Tigris and Euphrates, which have irrigated Iraq for millennia.",

One hundred years after it was made The Birth of a Nation still has the power to both enthrall and appall. The film is as confounding as ever, both brilliant and repugnant. Groundbreaking in its use of innovative cinematic techniques, it remains tainted by its brazen racism. The Birth of a Nation was the creation of DW Griffith, who had tried his hand as an actor and playwright but whose real genius lay in film-making. Nothing on its scale had even been attempted before. It was the epic story of the relationship between two American families, one Union, the other Confederate, at the time of the Civil War and the Reconstruction that followed. The film ran for more than three hours and employed (according to a New York Times report from the time) 18,000 people and 3,000 horses. By 1922 it had been watched by more than five million people. It was the first blockbuster.  It was a box office success   a mainstream film, so utterly mainstream,  says Professor Alan Rice, a Birth of a Nation expert at The Institute for Black Atlantic Research at the University of Central Lancashire, who has been organising a series of symposia on the film. It made history by becoming the first film ever to be screened at the White House. But it was revolutionary for another reason:  It was very important in [that] it was the first full-scale long narrative using a lot of the new techniques of film-making,  says Rice.",

        "content": "It s amazing how little art has changed since the decade of grunge rock and Ally McBeal. We re stuck in a rut and can t move on writes Jason Farago. How long does it take for the present to become history? Once our museums and universities were guardians of the past, but now they seem ever more concerned with the here and now. But what was once new must inevitably turn old, and historically minded curators are beginning to turn their gaze to the 1990s: a decade that feels like only yesterday and yet like ancient history all at the same time. They ve been coming thick and fast, these  what were the  90s?  surveys. In 2013, the New Museum in New York presented NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star, which filled the museum s entire building with art from the year of Bill Clinton s inauguration. Last year, the Centre Pompidou s satellite space in Metz unveiled 1984 1999: The Decade, which showcased the generation that put French art back on the global art world s map. And opening this week at New Jersey s Montclair Art Museum is Come As You Are: Art of the 1990s, a hotly anticipated full-scale survey of the last decade of the last millennium. The passing of the 1990s into history may feel a little sudden but this wave of 1990s shows marks a welcome effort to impose historical rigour on a period we still sometimes call  contemporary . By insisting on the distance between then and now, and by placing the works in the context of their times   Clinton and Blair, Bosnia and Rwanda, grunge rock and Ally McBeal   these shows do the great service of showing how this art came to be. Yet these exhibitions do something else too: they reveal that the gap between then and now might not be as gaping as presupposed, and that, in aesthetic terms at least, the  90s are still going strong 15 years past their expiration date. Dream of the  90s If you want to understand the art of the 1990s, you have to start not with aesthetics but with economics. The 1980s, especially in New York but also in cities from Cologne to Tokyo, was a period of media excess and frenzied stock market speculation, typified by aggressive large-scale painting that sold for lots of money. But in 1991 the art market crashed spectacularly, closing galleries right and left. Prices fell by more than 50% for many contemporary artists, and average art prices didn t recover their pre-crash height until 2003. (Now they are even higher, of course.) Art in the 1990s, in economic terms but also in aesthetic ones, went through a period of retrenchment and rethinking.  Value in everything is being questioned,  said Mary Boone, the influential 80s art dealer, in the midst of the crash.  The psychology in the 80's was excess; in the 90's, it's about conservation.  What typified the art of those days? Race, sexuality and multiculturalism were hotly debated at the start of the decade, notably at the controversial Whitney Biennial of 1993, of which the most famous artwork was an admissions button, designed by Daniel J Martinez, reading  I Can t Imagine Ever Wanting to Be White.  The rise of the World Wide Web had a strong influence on art production. So did celebrity culture, especially in Britain, where the Young British Artists hit the galleries and the tabloid front pages. The big theme was globalisation. That was reflected not only in the art of the time, but in the institutions that arose from it: the 1990s was the decade when biennials, from Johannesburg to Montreal to the South Korean city of Gwangju, became central nodes in artistic production and transmission.",

Despite glitches, it offers a glimpse of a future in which there are no linguistic misunderstandings   especially ones that change the course of history. BBC Culture looks back at the greatest mistranslations of the past, with a 19th-Century astronomer finding signs of intelligent life on Mars and a US president expressing sexual desire for an entire nation. Life on Mars When Italian astronomer Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli began mapping Mars in 1877, he inadvertently sparked an entire science-fiction oeuvre. The director of Milan s Brera Observatory dubbed dark and light areas on the planet s surface  seas  and  continents    labelling what he thought were channels with the Italian word  canali . Unfortunately, his peers translated that as  canals , launching a theory that they had been created by intelligent lifeforms on Mars. Convinced that the canals were real, US astronomer Percival Lowell mapped hundreds of them between 1894 and 1895. Over the following two decades he published three books on Mars with illustrations showing what he thought were artificial structures built to carry water by a brilliant race of engineers. One writer influenced by Lowell s theories published his own book about intelligent Martians. In The War of the Worlds, which first appeared in serialised form in 1897, H G Wells described an invasion of Earth by deadly Martians and spawned a sci-fi subgenre. A Princess of Mars, a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs published in 1911, also features a dying Martian civilisation, using Schiaparelli s names for features on the planet.",

        "content": "One of the surprising joys of downtown Los Angeles   a city most visitors think of as one great freeway where no-one even thinks of walking   is Grand Central Market on South Broadway. Opened in 1917 on the ground floor of the Homer Loughlin Building and designed by the English-born architect John B Parkinson, the market has served succeeding generations of immigrants. Today, 80% of those who shop here daily are Hispanic Americans, a fact reflected in the wealth of fresh fruit, vegetables and Spanish delis. Most of these, though, display their wares under all-American neon signs hung from the reinforced concrete beams of an innovative building where Frank Lloyd Wright, the most famous of all US architects, once ran his studio. The architecture of Seattle s Pike Place Market is a rambling affair in a number of different styles dating from 1907, when this waterfront enterprise first opened. Located on several hillside levels, the nine-acre (3,600 sq m) market offers everything from the freshest Pacific fish to local crafts. A publicly owned development, it houses some 500 people as well as feeding and delighting many more. Of course you can dine on sushi here, although in its early days and before Congress passed an act in 1942 sending them to internment camps for the duration of the Second World War, Japanese-American families had made their special mark here, owning at least 80% of the market stalls. Pike Place Market thrives today, a city centre alternative to a world of manufactured food and heavily marketed retailing. If you re lucky, you will even see   hard to miss him   Sol  The Cod Father  Amon, Pike Place s longest serving stall holder and a Seattle legend, outside Pure Food & Fish. Market buildings and big characters have long gone hand in hand. Les Halles   the  Belly of Paris . This mid-19th Century Crystal Palace of food, designed by the City Architect Victor Baltard, was demolished in 1971 (Wikimedia Commons) For sheer architectural beauty, Europe and the Middle East offer the finest of all covered markets. Despite intense competition from opulent palazzos and mesmerising art-laced churches, few visitors to Venice can fail to be impressed by the Pescheria, the covered fish market set cheek-by-gill with Rialto Bridge. A fish market has existed near here since 1097, although the existing Neo-Gothic building designed by architect Domenico Rupolo and painter Cesare Laurenti dates from 1907. Look up at the capitals crowning the columns supporting the roof: they sport fish heads rather than classically correct volutes or acanthus leaves. Competing for artistry, however, are the displays of fresh food on offer, here and in the next-door Erberia or fruit and vegetable market. The market is best approached by the traghetto   gondola ferry   from Santa Sofia on the other side of the Grand Canal. This way, the worlds of fish, water, boats, a very grand canal, a particular cuisine and unforgettable piscine architecture are caught in one distinctive Venetian net.

        "title": "The Americans: Were the KGB the good guys?",
        "content": "The US TV series examines the Cold War from the perspective of Russian agents   and offers up a radical revision of history, writes Eric Kohn. While the US may struggle with its own history of espionage, its CIA and FBI have nothing on the KGB. The Soviet security agency has been one of the great faceless  villains  in the American imagination since World War Two. Since so many of the Cold War s  battles  took place behind closed doors, some of the conflict s key moments   and even players   may be unknown to history. Hollywood usually responded to this lack of information about  what was really happening  by portraying the Cold War as a battle against Russians who are villainous caricatures   with the KGB as a one-note, shadowy threat. The US TV series The Americans, which begins its third season on 28 January, challenges that notion by giving Soviet agents a familiar face   one we are supposed to empathise with. This is a radical shift in perspective, the full implications of which haven t been examined as closely as they should. In the series, Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) are Soviet agents posing as a quiet suburban family in the early 1980s. As The Americans explores the agents' ongoing missions to disrupt US interests and juggle other daunting orders from their handlers, it adopts the twisting structure of a classic espionage tale. The disguises they wear when assuming different identities, marked by innumerable ridiculous wigs, wouldn't feel out of place in an episode of The A-Team or Alias. But the show has a distinctive edge thanks to creator Joe Weisberg, a former CIA agent, whose storylines continually emphasise the similarities between the spies and their American foes. The result is a subtle parody of American suburban life: Philip and Elizabeth grapple with how best to raise their children, navigate infidelities and jealousies, deal with  bedroom problems  and intrusive neighbours. It s the stuff of soap operas, except that this nuclear family has a hand in events that might actually go nuclear. The bad guys don't just look like  us ; they struggle like us, too. Seeing red A few years ago, Sleeper Cell, another programme on US TV, attempted a similar concept but set in the present day   with Islamic terrorists fighting the CIA on American soil. Yet its plot felt hyperbolic and out of touch with reality. The lure of dramatic embellishment also holds back other popular shows about domestic terrorism such as Homeland and 24, which offer escapist fantasies about American security measures but struggle to top each increasingly outlandish plot point with events that are even more extreme.",

        "content": "Urban cemeteries emerged in the 19th Century in response to cities  exploding populations. Jonathan Glancey looks at the history of these final resting places. The word cemetery, derived from ancient Greek, means a sleeping place. So, those countless inscriptions found in city cemeteries reading Gone to Sleep or Rest in Peace make perfect sense. Here, bodies lie in rows beneath stone and marble monuments as if asleep in secret dormitories. And   except for those susceptible to images from horror stories or George A Romero s Night of the Living Dead   cemeteries, as different as San Michele, the Venetian island graveyard, and Calvary Cemetery, Queens, with its tombs of Italian mobsters overlooking Manhattan   are truly restful places offering a sense of reverie and otherworldly escape from the teeming towns and cities they serve. The works of skilled landscape designers, architects, sculptors, letter carvers and gardeners, city cemeteries can be heartbreakingly beautiful. And, yet, although often havens for wildlife, compelling essays in the history of taste and design, and fascinating glimpses into social conventions and religious creeds, the genesis of cemeteries was a frightening one. Until the 19th Century, it was normal to bury the urban dead in churchyards. As the population of industrial cities in Europe skyrocketed, far too many corpses were shoe-horned into already crammed graveyards. These contaminated water supplies and horrific cholera epidemics ravaged cities.",

        "content": "We think of the Greeks as the orderly people who gave us drama, democracy and philosophy. But the fearsome creatures in Hellenic art reveal a dark side, writes Alastair Sooke. What do you think about when you hear the words  ancient Greece ? The conventional view is that the ancient Greeks provided the bedrock for Western civilisation. After all, they invented democracy, philosophy and drama. But it would be a mistake to imagine them as exclusively rational. Their society was shaped by strange and primal forces as much as the guiding light of reason. And nowhere is this more visible than in their art. One of the most intriguing aspects of ancient Greek art is its glut of fantastical creatures. When we consider Greek art, we tend to envisage marble statues of Olympian gods   but gorgons, griffins, centaurs and sphinxes are actually just as common. Lots of them were on show recently in New York, decorating all sorts of objects in the Metropolitan Museum of Art s exhibition Assyria to Iberia at the Dawn of the Classical Age. What was the significance of all these ferocious supernatural beasts? Fantastical animals were already part of the repertoire of Aegean craftsmen in prehistory, a millennium before the high point of the classical age in Athens in the Fifth Century BC. For instance, they star in the art of both the Minoan and Mycenaean civilisations of the Bronze Age. The famous  Throne Room  in the Minoan palace at Knossos on Crete was decorated with frescoes of elegant griffins   hybrid creatures with the bodies of lions and the heads of birds of prey. They flanked the chamber s so-called throne, as though conferring supernatural power upon whoever sat there.",

        "content": "Evelyn Nesbit achieved great fame more than a century ago as a model. She revolutionised cultural life, writes Lindsay Baker. What makes a supermodel? A preternatural beauty, of course, but there is more   a certain charisma, an unerring fashion instinct, a steely resilience, sex appeal. And a mere model becomes a  super  when she becomes not only stratospherically famous, but also when she somehow encapsulates her era. The supermodel provides a snapshot of a moment in time because she is always at the epicentre of the fashionable cultural life of her time   and at its vanguard. Every decade has their supers, from impish, mini-skirted, swinging- 60s icons Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy to quirky Cara Delevingne today. But the phenomenon goes back further than Twiggy, to the very start of the 20th Century, when the world s first ever supermodel rose to fame. Evelyn Nesbit, a willowy, copper-haired beauty from Philadelphia, was the most sought-after artists  and fashion model in America s Gilded Age. Her life was turbulent and eventful, and her fame peaked when she became embroiled in a murder, and what was then dubbed  the trial of the century . Nesbit embodied her era in more ways than one. The late 19th Century was a glamorous period of rapid economic growth in the US but it was also an era of considerable poverty, as many poor European immigrants poured in. Nesbit in her lifetime saw both sides. She came from a modest Scots-Irish background in Tarentum, Pennsylvania, and after her father died leaving debts, her mother struggled to support the family. It was also an age with one foot still in the starchy Victorian era and one just about to step into the permissive Roaring  20s. The young Evelyn was from a  respectable  family, and modelled   fully dressed   for artists from the age of 14, as a way out of poverty for the whole family. When she came to New York in 1900, her rise was meteoric. But she was also stepping into a new, different world. James Carroll Beckwith, whose main patron was John Jacob Astor, took her under his wing, introduced her to artists and illustrators, and Nesbit was soon the most in-demand model in New York. She was the inspiration for numerous art works, including sculptor George Grey Barnard s famous piece Innocence (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Charles Dana Gibson s Women: The Eternal Question (1905). She was a popular face too on the illustrated covers of many journals and magazines, among them Vanity Fair, Harper s Bazaar, The Delineator and Ladies  Home Journal, and her likeness was also to be found advertising everything from face creams to toothpastes. In demand Nesbitt s soft-featured, youthful face soon became ubiquitous, to be seen on postcards, tobacco cards, calendars and chromolithographs. She often posed for illustrators in costume   a wood nymph, a gypsy, a Grecian goddess, a geisha girl   she was always clothed and the resulting images were not overtly sexual, though there was a pin-up suggestiveness about them that no doubt contributed to their popularity   and Nesbit s celebrity.",

        "content": "John Singer Sargent s infamous portrait scandalised late-19th Century Paris. But who was the woman in the painting? Jason Farago investigates. She looks off to the right, staring out into the middle distance, her mouth shut tight, her dainty nose directed ever so slightly downward. Her right hand rests upon a bare wooden table, while her left hand, decorated with a wedding ring, clutches a folded fan. Her hair is twisted up, away from her shoulders   which are bare save for two straps, somewhat unconvincingly holding up her cinched, classical black gown. On her head is a little diamond tiara, but other than that and the ring she wears no jewelry. Between her long neck and the plunging, heart-shaped neckline of her dress lie acres of flesh, as cold and pale as ice milk. John Singer Sargent s portrait of the so-called  Madame X , painted in 1884 and now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, has attracted and repelled generations of gallery-goers. The stern face and the pseudonymous title have made her into a figure of mystery, an American Mona Lisa of inscrutable character. But her mystery, her anonymity, is not the result of lost historical documents or the covering of artistic footprints. Madame X, so alluring and so enigmatic, was once a bona fide celebrity   before it all came crashing down. John Singer Sargent s Portrait of Madame X caused a massive scandal upon its debut in Paris in 1884, in part because it emphasised the sexual allure of a married woman (Wikipedia) She was born Virginie Am lie Avegno, the daughter of white Creole parents in New Orleans. Her father died fighting for the Confederacy at the Battle of Shiloh in 1862. In 1866 her young brother died too, of congestive fever. Her widowed mother had had enough, and after taking out loans on the family plantation she left with her daughter to Paris in 1867. The City of Light must have seemed like a daydream after the devastation of the Civil War and the travails of Reconstruction that were just beginning. But Am lie had been brought to Paris for more than that. She was there to get married, big time   which she promptly did, to a banker more than twice her age, Pierre Gautreau. She was beguiling. Not conventionally pretty, she nevertheless cut a striking figure with her thin lips and extreme pallor; according to one Sargent biographer, she not only covered herself with powder, but also consumed arsenic to sap her skin of colour. (It was actually a less toxic substance .)  I remember seeing Madame de Gautrot [sic], the noted beauty of the day, and could not help stalking her as one does a deer,  wrote the American expatriate artist Edward Simmons.  Her head and neck undulated like that of a young doe . Every artist wanted to make her in marble or paint.  Yet though she had public admirers and a packet of money, she still struggled to climb to the top of Parisian society; the gossip pages took only limited notice of her, and as a Creole she would have been excluded from the highest echelons of the French beau monde. She, and her ambitious mother, were keen to make her name. And the young John Singer Sargent, who had commissions from fellow expats but craved French acceptance, was keen to make his. So there they were, the American society madam and the American painter, both in their late 20s, both eager for their big break. It took 30 sessions, and, as he would throughout his career, Sargent chose the dress: the little black number, which might actually be a two-piece skirt and bodice brutally drawn in at the waist, with severe d colletage. And   as a preparatory sketch in the Tate s collection shows   she originally appeared with one of the dress s straps missing. That bare shoulder, plus the wedding ring on her left hand, made a scandalous combination. It signified, not very subtly, that this married woman would look kindly on introductions from other men.",

        "content": "A historian claims Bach s wife wrote some of his works. That s up for debate, but these 10 female composers deserve recognition, Clemency Burton-Hill argues. Scandal threatened to rock the classical music world recently when a music historian named Professor Martin Jarvis reasserted his explosive theory that some of JS Bach s music was in fact written by his second wife, Anna Magdalena. His new documentary, Written By Mrs Bach, is described on its distributor s website as a  300 year old mystery and detective story , which incurs the  wrath of scholars worldwide  as it  challenges and confronts the myths surrounding Johann Sebastian Bach . Supported by  stunning visual forensic evidence , it claims that the handwriting in some of the original Bach manuscripts was not that of a mere transcriber or copyist, as we had previously understood Anna Magdalena to be, but bears the hallmarks of a mind in the act of creation. Over the years, plenty of minor works by JS Bach have been reattributed to others, with little furore. So why is this causing such a stir? Not only are the pieces in question some of Bach s greatest   including some of the Cello Suites and Well-Tempered Clavier   but the suggestion they might have been written by a woman rather than another man is raising the musical patriarchy s collective hackles. How could Anna Magdalena have written such sublime things, given she had over a dozen children to attend to, not to mention domestic duties galore? As critic Ivan Hewett notes, Bach s wife would also  have had to defy one of the strongest prejudices of her era , namely that  Woman, a lesser sort of being made from Adam s spare rib, couldn t possibly be creative. She could sing and play music, but only men could do the serious intellectual business of writing the stuff.  If Professor Jarvis  thesis turns out to be true, Hewett muses, it  puts a bomb right at the heart of the old patriarchal view of the Western tradition . Ever since Hildegard von Bingen in the 12th Century, women   as in other art forms   have made a significant contribution to classical music which has often been overlooked. This is not just a great injustice on an individual level to those creative and brilliant humans, but a shame for music history in general. Whether Anna Magdalena was the  real  Bach behind some of that glorious music or not, let s hope Professor Jarvis  arguments can inspire and empower classical-music-inclined females to slip out from their male counterparts  shadows. Because goodness knows we in classical music need our Beyonc s and our Taylor Swifts more than ever. Here are 10 undersung female composers who should be recognised for their contributions to the classical canon. 1. Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179)",

Just look forward, don t discuss. We have a lot to do with building up the country.  That s how actress Nina Hoss describes the attitude of many Germans, and German filmmakers in particular, in the first few decades after World War II.  It worked well to not look at it, what had happened in this country,  she says. But in the past 15 years, that attitude has changed dramatically, and German filmmakers have turned their cameras on the nation s darkest hour in films and TV miniseries like Downfall and Generation War. Christian Petzold s Phoenix is one of the latest German films to address the war and its aftermath, and it was a sensation at the Toronto Film Festival. It stars Hoss as a Jewish woman who survived imprisonment in a concentration camp and searches the rubble of post-war Berlin for her husband, who may have betrayed her to the Nazis. Petzold, a prominent member of the Berlin School of filmmakers, wanted his film to empathise with the victims of the Nazis rather than tell another story about the Nazis themselves. Reporting for Talking Movies, Christian Blauvelt examines the recent slate of German films about World War II and the difficulties German filmmakers face when depicting the period.

Harbours and market-places and pilgrimage sites   Venice, Naples, Genoa, Sicily, in Italy alone   begin to emerge as significant centres of talkative storytelling populations. To the north, Hans Christian Andersen s glowing Danish homeland is emitting powerful signals from regions stretching to the Arctic Circle. And when your eyes track his large force field, you begin to discover beacons blazing in the darkness, lit by the work of Walter Scott in Scotland, Alexander Afanasyev in Russia, and other omnivores of their countries  stories. The circumpolar regions, as well as the steppes and forests of Russia and Central Asia, are also rich in fairy tale ore.",

        "content": "It s one of the most famous paintings in the world   but why? Andrew Graham-Dixon explains how Van Gogh came to create his most celebrated work. At a time of decline in religious faith and amid an industrial revolution that changed landscapes and cities forever, artists in the Low Countries began to look inwards, turning art into a new kind of religion. The most famous artist to come out of the Netherlands and Belgium in the 19th Century, Vincent van Gogh s biography is well-known: the tortured man who cut off his ear in despair; the troubled soul who found ecstasy in the beauty of the French landscape. After unsucessfully attempting a career in the church, Van Gogh discovered his true calling in painting:  I ve found my work  he wrote in an early letter,  something which I live for heart and soul.  Andrew Graham-Dixon explains how the painter transformed everyday images of nature into visions of divine beauty, reaching a climax in his most famous subject: sunflowers. He painted the flowers in a fit of enthusiasm, the thick daubes of paint resembling, Graham-Dixon says,  the hot, peppery, garlic-infused mayonnaise  called aioli.

        "content": "Vogue model, Surrealist muse   and war correspondent. As a combat photographer with the US forces during WWII, Lee Miller created a unique historic record.  I was living in Hitler s private apartment in Munich when his death was announced.  These words came not from a high-ranking Nazi officer or a hardened Allied soldier, but from a fashion model-turned-photographer. Lee Miller   who became the muse and lover of Surrealist artist Man Ray during the early 1930s after appearing on the cover of Vogue   was one of a small number of female combat photographers embedded with Allied troops in WWII. Her account of their advance in Western Europe has been put together from manuscripts, negatives and contact sheets for the new book Lee Miller s War: Beyond D-Day. After her death in 1977, Miller s son Antony Penrose discovered the records in trunks in her attic. In the book s afterword, he describes finding  maps still splattered with Alsatian mud, captions and notes scribbled on scraps of paper, orders and passes from the military, looted souvenirs . Miller s photographs and reports appeared as spreads in Vogue between 1944 and 1945.  The gore and violence of her articles feature boldly in the pages,  says Penrose.  The grim skeletal corpses of Buchenwald are separated by a few thicknesses of paper from delightful recipes to be prepared by beautiful women dressed in sumptuous gowns.  Evacuating wounded in Normandy (Lee Miller archives, England 2014. All rights reserved) Miller rarely talked about the war in the years that followed   Penrose describes how she spent them  in a misery of depression and alcohol abuse    but she gave evocative accounts in her reports for Vogue.  The ward was like a jungle of banyan trees. A maze of hanging rubber tubes swaying in khaki shadow   one to the nostril and one to the wound of each man.  Miller s description of an evacuation hospital near Omaha beach in Normandy was published in the fashion magazine in August 1944. Her story, Unarmed Warriors, was Miller s first as a war correspondent accredited by the US Forces.",

In 1878, a year after he created the phonograph, US inventor Thomas Edison noted that the cylinder could be rotated backwards to pleasing effect:  the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way . Since avant-garde musicians in the 1950s first experimented with tape recorders, editing together sound fragments in a style called  musique concr te , messages have been inserted into songs that only become clear once they are played backwards. But which are the best, and which are just myths? Pop will eat itself This video is no longer available Death metal bands don t hold the monopoly on hidden messages: one pop group has been at the centre of rumours for nearly five decades. The Beatles first stumbled across what is called  backmasking    recording a message backwards onto a track   when they were making their Rubber Soul album in 1965. Influenced by the techniques of musique concr te, they featured a backmasked line in Rain, a single released in 1966. Featuring in the fade-out, the reversed vocal is the first line of the song.  On the end of Rain you hear me singing it backwards,  John Lennon told Rolling Stone magazine in 1968.  We'd done the main thing at EMI and the habit was then to take the songs home and see what you thought a little extra gimmick or what the guitar piece would be. So I got home about five in the morning, stoned out of my head, I staggered up to my tape recorder and I put it on, but it came out backwards, and I was in a trance in the earphones, what is it   what is it? It's too much, you know, and I really wanted the whole song backwards almost, and that was it. So we tagged it on the end.  Right to reply",

        "content": "During WWI, artists created optical illusions on water with camouflage  dazzle paintings . Now a sculptor and a painter have revived the technique. The periscope broke through the water. The U-boat captain had to be quick: he had just a few seconds to find his target and fire. And then the ship he was tracking appeared to break up, jolt, change direction. The torpedo missed. That was the idea, anyway. The scientist John Graham Kerr first suggested the use of camouflage to make it difficult to calculate a ship s course in 1914, but it was an artist who developed the technique. British marine painter and poster artist Norman Wilkinson was inspired to create  dazzle  camouflage after serving as a Royal Navy volunteer in a submarine patrol at Gallipoli and on a minesweeping ship off the British coast. Instead of attempting to render warships invisible, he aimed to confuse the enemy with contrasting colours and shapes that distorted the ship s form and obscured its movement in the water. The troopship USS Leviathan, 1918. (Hirz/Frederic Lewis/Archive Photos/Getty Images) Now the optical illusions have been revived as part of a series of art commissions celebrating the centenary of World War I. Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez has created a new work for a historic pilot ship in Liverpool, and in London today, Tobias Rehberger unveiled his transformation of the HMS President, which served as a  dazzle ship  during the conflict. The German sculptor won the Golden Lion award at the 53rd International Venice Biennale with a cafe he created using the principles of dazzle painting. Although Wilkinson s own artwork was traditional   he was commissioned to create paintings for the smoking rooms on the Titanic   his dazzle designs have been compared to the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Curves on the hull of a ship could create the impression of a wave, shapes on smokestacks suggested the ship was facing another direction, and patterns at bow and stern made it hard to see which was which.",

For the technically or mathematically minded, a geodesic dome is a spherical structure composed of triangular elements forming part of a network of circles, or  geodesics , on the surface of a given sphere. This description might seem a little mind-bending, yet for New Age Americans in the 1960s and  70s, the geodesic dome, for all its formal complexity, represented freedom, the potential to create a wholly new form of lightweight structure that, theoretically, could be placed anywhere within the United States. The idea of a home that could be manufactured in a factory and flown by helicopter to any suitable plot of land had long been a dream of the US inventor Richard Buckminster Fuller. Born in 1895, Fuller was a more or less a practical dreamer. Expelled twice from Harvard, he took on such unlikely jobs as a labourer in a stockyard and commander of a crash rescue boat in World War I before finding funds   through persuasion and charm   to develop a number of prototypes for factory made homes. He called these radical devices Dymaxion houses. Fuller believed they would sell like Model-T Fords, but they never quite caught on. Fuller even developed a Dymaxion car that was like no other that has been seen on US roads or anywhere else since. The British architect Norman Foster has recently had a replica built of this enormous, three-wheel, streamlined Buck Rogers-style car. Originally, only three were built.",

        "title": "Going up: How the elevator changed everything",
        "content": "The invention of the elevator enabled a whole new type of architecture   and had a profound effect on our culture, writes Jonathan Glancey. Scary stories about elevators are a dime a dozen: lurid tales about lifts are ten a penny. Lifts and elevators are, of course, one and the same thing, yet whatever you choose to call them, they have long evoked fears of being trapped inside or of plunging to death down dark, vertiginous shafts. A gift to filmmakers, the elevator was as its nastiest in De Lift, a 1983 Dutch shocker directed by Dick Maas in which an elevator fitted with a bio-computer brain finds nasty ways to kill those unwittingly foolish enough to ride it. As an antidote, watch Alfred Hitchcock s North by Northwest. In one scene of this immeasurably stylish 1959 thriller, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), an advertising executive mistaken for a spy rides a busy hotel lift along with his mother, hotel guests and a pair of murderous bad guys. The tension is broken when mother says, ever so politely,  You gentlemen aren t really trying to kill my son, are you?  Cue polite and then increasingly hysterical laughter from those crowded in to the lift including the thwarted gunmen   as Grant stares grimly ahead. The famous moment from North by Northwest when Roger Thornhill s mother single-handedly foils a plot to kill her son in a hotel lift (MGM) Lifts have engendered such heightened fears and emotions ever since Elisha Graves Otis demonstrated his elevator safety brake at the New York Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations in 1853. Standing on a high platform, this showman-inventor ordered the rope holding him up severed with an axe. Almost before the crowd below had time to gasp, the lift would grind to a sudden halt. Repeated many times, this theatrical demonstration convinced the world that lifts were safe. They had existed for at least 2000 years   Vitruvius, the first century Roman architect, noted a design for one by Archimedes dating from around 235BC   but Otis proved they were safe for everyday use.",

        "title": "9/11 Memorial Museum: How to remember?",
        "content": "What is striking, though, is the limited nature of the museum s mission. Early visitors have described the wrenching experience of its permanent collection galleries as if they were reliving that awful day, but there is little about the causes of 9/11, except for a short film that has been widely criticized as Islamophobic.. Holland Cotter, the New York Times s co-chief art critic, noted that the museum s depiction of 9/11 is  not so much wrong as drastically incomplete,  offering  news, not analysis.  And, if it remains so, the museum might not have the importance for future generations that it does for ours. A steel beam from the original World Trade Center stands at the center of the Foundation Hall of the museum (Getty Images) Very few museums focus with such single-mindedness on one disaster or one historical crime: Holocaust museums, say, or the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. Even battlefield sites, such as the Gettysburg Museum in Pennsylvania, regularly take in larger remits than the single event that happened at the site. That s for good reason. Museums do best when they not only narrate history, but place it in context and set it in motion. The Smithsonian, for example, does not recount the history of slavery in a standalone institution; slavery is right in the middle of the National Museum of American History. And that s as it should be   the history of the United States is inseparable from the history of slavery, and to separate the part from the whole would diminish both. In context With an event as traumatic as 9/11, whose history is still being written and whose victims are still among us, a more capacious view might be difficult. (And there is some history here. In 2005, George Pataki   the former New York governor and the great villain of the World Trade Center s reconstruction, who also overruled his own jury s recommendations for the site s design   evicted a planned historical museum from the 9/11 museum s site, which conservatives bashed as a  blame America monument. ) But even the greatest traumas, with the greatest need for respect and remembrance, offer room for context. One excellent case study is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Even while the museum insists on the uniqueness and irreducibility of the Holocaust, it also looks more broadly at anti-Semitism and discrimination, as well as at other genocides and war crimes, some dismayingly recent. The museum s permanent exhibition, with its searing display of thousands of victims  shoes, has lost none of its force in the decades since it opened. But it has also presented exhibitions related to Bosnia, Darfur, and most impressively Rwanda   a genocide with horrible parallels to the Holocaust, and which the museum has researched in depth since 1994. Last month, museum officials traveled to Kigali for the 20th anniversary commemorations of the Rwandan genocide; accompanying them was Margit Meissner, a Holocaust survivor. Alice Greenwald, the director of the 9/11 museum, is a veteran of Washington s Holocaust museum. Having steered the new institution to this week s opening, I hope that she thinks about the successes of her previous one, and begins to imagine ways in which the atrocious events of 9/11 could be placed in their historical epoch, rather than shown as an event wrenched out of time. Maybe the political risks are too formidable, and maybe it s too soon: Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, who has admitted to planning the 9/11 attacks, is still being held at Guant namo Bay, where his trial is once again delayed. But in a few years, perhaps, the museum may be ready to look beyond the few hours of that Tuesday in September and take into its narrative all the stories that came before and since: the attacks in Madrid and London and Bali, the ongoing revelations about government surveillance, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. That would be the best way to ensure that 9/11 retains its relevance when the millions of us who lived through it are gone, and it is left to New Yorkers born after 2001 to educate the living and commemorate the dead.",

        "content": "The truth is that despite frenzied speculation (was she the artist s daughter, or perhaps his mistress?), we will probably never know the identity of the model for Vermeer s Girl   if there even was one. Vermeer, himself, is a shadowy figure in the history of art. Once nicknamed  the sphinx of Delft , his native town which he never left, he produced little   only around three dozen paintings are today agreed to be by him. He also left behind few biographical traces, though we do know that his wife bore him 15 children. He is recognised as a master of light who specialised in painting women in sparse domestic interiors, and his pictures are prized in part because they are often suffused with mystery. Unlike some of his Dutch contemporaries, who crammed their compositions full of material objects and narrative detail, Vermeer got a kick out of teasing the viewer and withholding meaning. In one of his canvases, for instance, an elegant couple is engaged in a music lesson   but is the gentleman her tutor, a suitor, or her lover? We will never know. As for his Girl, well, she is even more perplexing. As Emilie Gordenker, the director of the Mauritshuis, told me recently, 17th-Century viewers would have looked at Vermeer s painting and seen not a portrait but a type of picture known as a  tronie .  A  tronie  is a study of a head and shoulders dressed in exotic clothing,  she explains. The giveaway is the turban: it lends an oriental flavour to the canvas, transporting viewers to a faraway realm of the imagination.  While it is possible that someone modelled for it,  Gordenker says,  just as Rubens often painted figures who looked like his wife, it isn t meant to be a specific person, but someone more generalised, timeless and mysterious   perhaps a sibyl or a figure from the Bible.  Moreover, according to one theory, the impossible pearl, which is too big to be worn in reality, was meant to be understood as a piece of costume jewellery   so adding to the general atmosphere of artifice and make-believe. For Gordenker, this  sense of mystery  is what attracts people to the Girl.  Partly, she s just gorgeous   that s easy,  she says.  But the composition is also very clever. Out of that dark background, she pops into our space looking very much alive   and the gesture is a big part of that. Her mouth is open, which you don t see that much in Dutch paintings, so she seems as if she is about to talk to you. I m dying to know what she s going to say. And around the world   in Japan, in the United States, in Italy   everybody has the same reaction: you can see them trying to fill in the story.   The image works because it is unresolved,  agrees Tracy Chevalier, whose novel about the painting has sold more than three million copies.  You can t ever answer the question of what she s thinking or how she s feeling. If it were resolved, then you d move onto the next painting. But it isn t, so you turn back to it again and again, trying to unlock that mystery. That s what all masterpieces do: we long to understand them, but we never will.  Lost and found The curious thing, though, is that it hasn t always been this way. A hundred years ago, visitors to the Mauritshuis were more eager to see Paulus Potter s gargantuan canvas The Bull (1647), which, with its massive, mud-spattered bovine protagonist, was prized as the last word in Dutch naturalism. Back then Vermeer s Girl was more wallflower than superstar.",

        "content": "Verdi s operas are well known   but what about his work as a member of parliament and fervent supporter of Italian unification? On the eve of the composer s 200th anniversary, Clemency Burton-Hill looks back at Verdi s life and times. Can you imagine any country today in national mourning over the death of a classical composer? When Giuseppe Verdi, born 200 years ago next week, died in January 1901, Italy wept as one. Almost a quarter of a million people took to the streets, marching to Va, Pensiero from Nabucco   better known as the Chorus of Hebrew Slaves   sung by a massed choir under the baton of celebrated maestro Arturo Toscanini. Verdi was a truly great composer: there is no question about it. Along with an eternal Requiem, some ravishing sacred choral music and a few notable chamber and orchestral works, there are of course the thirty-odd operas, at least twenty of which are in the core operatic canon. More than any year in recent memory, 2013 has seen a succession of major composers  anniversaries   Benjamin Britten s centenary, the bicentenary of Richard Wagner s birth, the four-hundredth anniversary of Gesualdo s grisly death   and it is noticeable that, in comparison to the festivities arranged for these other dates, the Verdi bicentenary has scarcely made an impact. This is not an indication of the esteem in which he is held; it merely reflects the fact that his music is performed all the time anyway, all over the world. It s a pretty safe bet that, on any given night, someone somewhere will be singing Rigoletto or Otello, Aida or Violetta. But the reason the Italians took to the streets that wintry day at the dawn of the last century was about much more than just music. Verdi s operas had provided the soundtrack to the politically tempestuous half-century that preceded his death, and his most famous arias had become quasi-anthems for a nation recently unified. When Nabucco had its premiere at La Scala in 1842,  Italy  was simply a cluster of geographically contiguous kingdoms and principalities with little more to unite them than a common language. So when Italians sang the Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves at Verdi s funeral procession, it wasn t just because it was a catchy tune they knew the words to. Its subject   the Israelites giving poignant voice to their longing for the promised land   had become a powerful analogue for the long-frustrated desires of the Italian people. When they cried  Viva Verdi!  during the funeral procession, they were still acutely conscious of the slogan s double meaning and its clandestine resonance for the agitators of  the Risorgimento , as the cause of Italian nationalism was known. The letters VERDI also spelled out the name of the King of Sardinia who, in 1861, finally took the throne of a unified nation for the first time since the 6th Century   Victor Emmanuele Re D Italia. That same year, at the request of the new Prime Minister Camillo Cavour, Verdi entered the country s very first parliament, in which he served for four years. Call me uncharitable, but I suspect the likes of Silvio Berlusconi (or Enrico Letta, or Mario Monti) would be hard pressed to name a contemporary classical composer, let alone invite them into the big tent of government.  Honour those heroes!",

        "content": "Alastair Sooke looks through the ultimate Renaissance man s anatomical sketchbooks   scientific masterpieces full of lucid insights into the functioning of the human body. We tend to think of Leonardo da Vinci as a painter, even though he probably produced no more than 20 pictures before his death in 1519. Yet for long periods of his career, which lasted for nearly half a century, he was engrossed in all sorts of surprising pursuits, from stargazing and designing ingenious weaponry to overseeing a complex system of canals for Ludovico Maria Sforza, the ruling duke of Milan. During the course of his life, Leonardo filled thousands of pages of manuscript with dense doodles, diagrams, and swirling text, probing almost every conceivable topic. Not for nothing, then, is he often considered the archetypal Renaissance man: as the great British art historian Kenneth Clark put it, Leonardo was the most relentlessly curious person in history. Yet according to Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Man, a new exhibition at the Edinburgh International Festival, one area of scientific endeavour piqued Leonardo s curiosity arguably more than any other: human anatomy. Leonardo s interest in anatomy began when he was working for Ludovico in Milan.  On the 2nd day of April 1489 , as he wrote at the head of a page in a new notebook, he sat down to begin his  Book entitled On the Human Figure . After executing a sequence of stunning drawings of a skull, though, his studies went into abeyance, probably because he lacked access to corpses that he could dissect. Bodies of evidence But his ambitions to publish a comprehensive treatise on human anatomy persisted   and around two decades later, he returned to his otherwise unused notebook, which is now known as the Anatomical Manuscript B and is kept at the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. In it he made a number of pen-and-ink drawings recording his observations while dissecting an old man who had died in a hospital in Florence in the winter of 1507-08. In the years that followed, Leonardo concentrated on human anatomy more systematically than ever before   and by the end of his life he claimed that he had cut up more than 30 corpses. In the winter of 1510-11, while probably collaborating with a young professor of anatomy called Marcantonio della Torre at the University of Pavia, Leonardo compiled a series of 18 mostly double-sided sheets exploding with more than 240 individual drawings and over 13,000 words of notes. Now known as the Anatomical Manuscript A, and also in the Royal Collection, these sheets are full of lucid insights into the functioning anatomy of the human body.",

        "content": "Fifty years ago, Martin Luther King s speech defined America s civil rights struggle. And it was a song by soul singer Mahalia Jackson that stole the show. Mahalia Jackson took America to church 50 years ago. Minutes before her friend Martin Luther King Jr. announced  I have a dream  to cap the March on Washington DC on 28 August 1963, Sister Mahalia reminded the 250,000 citizens spread out in front of the Lincoln Memorial of the long road they had travelled.  You know my soul looks back in wonder, how I got over,  she sang, praising the heavens for allowing her people to make it this far. But their struggle was far from over. A Hammond organ simmered, and rhythmic handclapping broke out as the singer closed her eyes and rhapsodised. In the past, the gospel classic How I Got Over had allowed her to cut loose for 10, even 15 minutes at a time as she worked church aisles and reached into the pews to grasp hands and anoint foreheads. She had recorded several versions of the song, but they were relatively tame compared to the heights she could reach in front of a congregation. Now, in the minutes before King was to speak, it was once again Holy Ghost time   the type of performance where Jackson surrendered not just her voice but her body to the moment, bending and twisting her robust frame as she reached for the notes. The legendary singer would be the final musical performer on a day in which the civil rights movement mingled with folk music and gospel in front of a national audience   not just the quarter-million assembled to hear King speak about job equality and voting rights, but millions more watching on television and listening on the radio. Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Odetta, the Freedom Singers and Marian Anderson also had performed, but it was Jackson who seized the day with a song that had particularly deep resonance in the African-American community. Pioneer of protest There is some dispute about the exact origins of How I Got Over. Reverend William Herbert Brewster is often credited with writing the song, though it was reinterpreted and popularized by Clara Ward and her family gospel group, the Famous Ward Sisters. In a memoir written by Ward s sister, Willa, she claims the song was inspired by a racial incident in Georgia during the early  50s while the family was travelling between performances. The Wards rode in a Cadillac, which drew unwanted attention from a group of whites, who blocked the road and viciously taunted the passengers. Only a feigned speaking-in-tongues seizure by the family matriarch, Gertrude Ward, prevented the incident from turning even uglier, and possibly deadly, Willa wrote in How I Got Over: Clara Ward and the World-Famous Ward Singers. The whites scattered when they saw Gertrude writhing, shaking and babbling.",

        "content": "An idea that came from Hitler would become the best-selling car of all time. Jonathan Glancey explains our enduring love for the Volkswagen Beetle. In 1945, a rare and curious Volkswagen car was shipped from its bomb-damaged German factory to England. Here, a commission of leading British motor manufacturers, chaired by Sir William Rootes, inspected the small, streamlined saloon. It would be  quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer , the commission reported.  It is too ugly and noisy , while  to build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.  This damning judgement proved as ill founded as that of Decca record bosses who, in 1962, declared  The Beatles have no future in show business , and turned the mop-tops down. Since then, global sales of highly lucrative Beatles  albums have topped two billion. The Volkswagen Beetle, meanwhile, with its friendly styling by the Austrian designer Erwin Komenda, and innovative engineering by Ferdinand Porsche, became the best-selling car of all time. Production of the Beetle outstripped that of Henry Ford s Model-T when the 15,007,034th car rolled off the line at Wolfsburg in 1972. The very last Beetles were made in Mexico in 2003 by when more than 21.5 million had been built worldwide. As its name made clear, the Volkswagen was truly a  People s Car , and, although many modifications were made between 1945 and 2003, the first and last Beetles were clearly peas in the the same mechanical pod. Star vehicle The remarkable thing about the Beetle is not just the sheer number of sales, but the fact that a car developed from an idea of Adolf Hitler s was to become as loved by Californian surf dudes, college kids and free lovin  hippies as it was desired by fervent Nazis. Herbie   the anthropomorphic star of six Hollywood movies beginning with The Love Bug in 1968   was the same car German families had saved up for before Hitler s invasion of Poland dashed their hopes. Ultimately, the sheer quality, along with the affordability, reliability, economy and distinct look and feel of the Beetle, ensured its success. It had, though, been touch and go for Volkswagen in 1945. Although the car had been on the drawing board since 1934, following a meeting between Hitler and Porsche, the Volkswagen failed to get into production before the war.",

        "content": "He murdered his wife and her lover, was tried for witchcraft and dabbled in sadomasochism. But it is for his glorious music, not his grisly crimes, that we should remember Carlo Gesualdo, writes Clemency Burton-Hill.  Irrefutably badass  is not the obvious phrase to reach for when discussing a late-Renaissance lutenist and composer whose output was chiefly a capella madrigals and settings of sacred texts. But it is how Alex Ross, the esteemed critic of The New Yorker describes Don Carlo Gesualdo, who died 400 years ago this week   and badass Gesualdo indisputably was, both as a musician and as a man. A figure of fascination over the years for artists as diverse as Igor Stravinsky, Aldous Huxley, Bernardo Bertolucci and Werner Herzog, the continuing fixation on Gesualdo four centuries after his death is not surprising when you consider the grisly and gruesome details of his biography. We tend to think of classical music as a rather staid affair; its practitioners generally well-behaved servants at court who busy themselves with counterpoint and harmony, not murder and sadism. Gesualdo, on the other hand, lived a life   and death   that the most luridly resourceful director of slasher B-movies might struggle to dream up. A prince and nobleman from a prominent aristocratic family in the Kingdom of Naples, at 20 Gesualdo married his 24-year-old first cousin, the legendarily alluring Maria d Avalos, who already had two marriages behind her. Both husbands are said to have expired  in excess of connubial bliss . One fateful night in October 1590, Gesualdo discovered her in flagrante with the Duke of Andria, Don Fabrizio Carafa (he was wearing Maria s silk nightgown at the time). Gesualdo immediately set about slaughtering the pair, slashing their limbs with his sword, mutilating their sexual organs, and puncturing their skulls with the bullets of his gun. He then allegedly murdered the baby boy who may or may not have been his or Don Fabrizio s child by swinging him to death in his castle courtyard. Immune from the law by dint of his noble status, things didn t look up much for the prince after that: married again, he became subject to fits of depression that could only be relieved by regular beatings from a group of young boys kept at his castle for this express purpose. Embroiled in both the Spanish Inquisition and a witchcraft trial (he was supposedly tormented by the spells and potions of his rejected former concubine), Gesualdo ended his days in a depressive tumult and is said to have been beaten to death, aged 47, by his servants in some kind of masochistic rampage.

        "content": "But why would the studio heads, most of whom were Jewish, so willingly agree to shape their movies to please Nazi sensibilities? Urwand suggests it was all about maintaining access to the German market. Urwand s critics claim he has got it wrong   that the German market wasn t consistently lucrative in the 1930s. On this point, Urwand concedes that box office revenues really started to dwindle by about 1936   and that in 1937 one US studio sustained a loss in Germany. But he maintains Hollywood was thinking in the long term   it wanted to maintain a business relationship to ensure it had access to markets in Germany and other European countries that Hitler might conquer should the Third Reich prevail. Some of Urwand s detractors also maintain he has overplayed the role and influence of the German consul in Hollywood. Steven J Ross, Professor of History at USC, who is working on a book called Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews and their Spies Foiled Nazi and Fascist Plots Against America, argues that it wasn t George Gyslling who had the power but local American officials enforcing the Motion Picture Production Code. The Production Code was a set of self-imposed guidelines that Hollywood adopted. Its stipulations governed how filmmakers could cover a wide range of subjects   everything from sex, drugs and murder to the depiction of American flag. Ross notes that it also  prohibited any studio from making a film that denigrated any foreign country or leader. So that meant that most of the efforts to produce anti-fascist films didn t get produced not because of Gyssling but because of the Production Code censors simply refusing to allow it to be made because it violated the code.  Also, it s argued that there are other reasons why the studio heads didn t fight more strongly to make films with anti-fascist themes   or for the inclusion of Jewish characters in their movies. Film critic David Denby says that  the studio bosses were all from Eastern Europe. They never lost their feeling that as outsiders and as Jews, it could all be taken away.  Consequently they may have been hesitant, in an anti-Semitic environment, of taking any action which could be construed as being favourable to Jewish interests. LA influential",

Adolf Hitler, a failed artist with deeply conservative tastes, waged a propaganda battle against modernist art which foreshadowed his total war against the rest of Europe. The Bauhaus, with its clean lines and community aesthetic, was described as  the crucible of modernism . It epitomised what Hitler viewed as an evil threat. Hitler was particularly fond of architecture. He became obsessed with the idea of rebuilding Berlin as the new capital of Europe and remodelling his 'home town' of Linz, even as he hid in his bunker in 1945. Graham-Dixon looks at how post-war artists have dealt artistically with a country that wants to forget, finding in present-day Berlin signs that German art is finally coming to terms with its dark past.

Concorde flew for the last time ten years ago. This supremely elegant airliner has yet to be replaced and, in an age of ubiquitous flying buses, cheap flights and long-term recession, perhaps it never will be. Glamorous and exclusive, a technological marvel and a thing of daunting beauty, Concorde belonged to an era that has vanished in a cloud of burned kerosene.

Through the aircraft s small windows, passengers could see dark blue space above them and the curvature of the Earth below.

        "content": "Fifty years since the Rolling Stones released their first single, Greg Kot asks whether the band s music has suffered from comparison with The Beatles. By the time the Rolling Stones got around to making records in 1963, The Beatles had already been cutting tracks with George Martin at Abbey Road studios for nearly a year. The Beatles were already stars, and their sweep made what the Stones did (and every other band in the UK, for that matter) seem like a response. In the end, of course, the Stones got their due as rock s nastiest band   that is, until Johnny Rotten came along. Since then, history has pretty much confined the two legendary groups to their prescribed roles: The Beatles as innovators and universal pop icons, the Stones as the anti-Beatles, the dirtiest Chicago blues band not from Chicago. Myth becomes fact. Or does it? It s hard to imagine that a band currently charging as much as $600 for their North American concert tour could once have been underrated. But the Stones  musical contributions often get short shrift because of the huge shadow cast by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and, yes, even Ringo Starr. On the occasion of the 50-year anniversary of the Rolling Stones  first single   a cover of Chuck Berry s Come On, released in June 1963   it s time to reassess. Were the Stones as revolutionary as the Beatles? No, but their reign of good-to-great albums was nearly twice as long, and their best music from this era   1963 through 1981   has a consistency, durability and variety that few bands from any era could match. Not even The Beatles, it turns out. The Beatles were running on fumes during the Let it Be sessions in 1969 and broke up soon after piecing together their final masterpiece, Abbey Road. The Stones were already playing it prickly on their first single. Come On was loosely modelled on Berry s original, recorded in 1960 at Chess Records studio in Chicago, but it had nothing of the guitarist s bounce and brightness. Berry raced through the lyrics with breathless anxiety, but the Stones played it rough and sullen as Mick Jagger sneered his way through the obstacles life dared to throw at him. The track rippled onto the pop charts. A few months later the Stones would have an even bigger hit with another cover, I Wanna Be Your Man, written by two guys named Lennon and McCartney, who were already so popular in the UK that they could hand leftovers to their rivals and watch them turn into gold. The British invasion The Beatles invaded and seduced America, with their three-night run on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964. For the next six years they were the biggest rock band in the world. The Stones followed The Beatles overseas a few months later, but were smugly mocked by Dean Martin on a less popular TV variety show, Hollywood Palace.",

        "content": "To celebrate 100 years since the composer s birth, Clemency Burton-Hill recommends the best way for a casual listener to discover the magic of Britten s music. 2013 has brought forth an embarrassment of riches when it comes to musical anniversaries. As well as the bicentenaries of Wagner and Verdi, the year marks four centuries since the musical visionary and murderer Gesualdo died and one since the marvel that is Benjamin Britten was born. Britten s musical language is singular and can be tough going, and his sound world can be as disconcerting and strange as it is ravishing. Where in Britten s output might a casual listener begin? For me, the master keys that unlocked Britten s universe were his Canticles. A listen to the complete cycle will take less than a single hour of your life but resonate far beyond. Composed between 1947 and 1974, they bookend Britten s post-war career and form a unique strand in his oeuvre.  They are song, opera, cantata and chamber music , says the tenor Ben Johnson, a rising British (and Britten) star, whose critically-acclaimed new recording of the Canticles is out now on Signum Classics.  And so they correspond with the most delicate of intimacy and the most effective of grand gesture . There can be  no greater summary , he reckons, of Britten s work. Like a prayer Suffused with spirituality if not overtly liturgical ( canticle , loosely defined, denotes a short prayer-like song), they are five precise distillations of Britten s art: gem-like compressions of his supreme talents as a dramatist of human emotion. Musically spare and occasionally subversive, the Canticles shimmer with dissonance and drama, love and chaos. They seethe, they teem, they shatter. They are not, Johnson cautions,  easy listening . But much of the engagement and the wonder   especially for a bookish listener   comes from Britten s ability to set text with such mastery. As a new exhibition at the British Library explores, Britten always had a splendidly literary intelligence, writing operas based on Thomas Mann (Death in Venice), Shakespeare (A Midsummer Night s Dream), Henry James (The Turn of the Screw) and Herman Melville (Billy Budd). The words of the Canticles drink wide and deep across English literature, from the Bible to 17th-Century metaphysical poetry; from medieval Chester Miracle Plays to Edith Sitwell, whose Still Falls The Rain is the basis for the mournful Canticle III   composed in memory of the young pianist Noel Mewton-Wood, who had recently killed himself.",

First-time visitors to New York have been pointing excitedly to the pencil thin profile of the Empire State Building for more than eighty years. Lit up by night in coats of many electric colours celebrating high days and holidays, its spire sometimes vanishing into low cloud, at others crackling with lightning, this commanding and supremely elegant skyscraper is, beyond doubt, one of the world s most revered buildings. In some ways this is surprising. To bring the 1,454-ft (443 m) skyscraper down to earth, the Empire State Building is nothing more than an office block, and for several decades many of its 102 floors were rather shabby. It got off to a less than auspicious start. Declared open by President Herbert Hoover on 1 May 1931, the  tallest building in the world  was hit by the Great Depression. A year on, just a quarter of its floors had been occupied; and it took until 1950 before what New Yorkers dubbed the  Empty State Building  turned a profit. Worse still, on 28 July 1945 a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber flying through fog smashed into the offices of the National Catholic Welfare Council housed on the 79th and 80th floors, killing fourteen people. Today, the Empire State Building   home to some 1,000 businesses   is profitable and, enjoying a major renovation, becoming cleaner and  greener  than it has ever been. Clad in Indiana limestone, this slim steel-framed 20th Century ziggurat rockets up from the site of the old Waldorf Astoria Hotel. This was bought by a consortium led by John J Raskob, a high-rolling New York financier   a papal knight and father of thirteen children   who worked for General Motors.

Raskob is said to have asked his architect, Brooklyn-born William Lamb of Shreve Lamb and Harmon,  Bill, how high can you make it so it won t fall down?

Drawing on the design of his earlier 314-ft (96m) Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Lamb prepared his design drawings in a fortnight.",

        "content": "A new book, Rocking the Wall, claims that that concert, and in particular a short speech which Springsteen gave in German from the stage, galvanised attitudes. As the author, Erik Kirschbaum, tells the BBC:  Three-hundred-thousand East Germans were there   young, enthusiastic East Germans who had never had the chance to see a big Western rock star like that. Chimes of freedom?  Springsteen played an amazing concert   four hours long. It went straight to their hearts.  But what added the political impetus was that in the middle of it, Springsteen defied the authorities and gave a speech no more than a paragraph long. He spoke in German, which he had written out phonetically:  I am not for or against a government. I ve come to play rock and roll for you, in the hope that one day all barriers will be torn down.  He was greeted with a roar of approval. The moment he had spoken, he took off into Chimes of Freedom:  Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake/ Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsaked/ Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake/ An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing . The concert was transmitted with a time delay on East German television and radio channels and the short but utterly powerful speech never made it to air   but those in the concert knew exactly what  barriers  meant, and their word of mouth later travelled the nation. Of course, those words did not cause the collapse of communism. If they had not been spoken, East Germany s communist regime would still have crashed. The forces of change were too strong. But those forces didn t move on their own. Some factors pushed them further and some held them back. Some fanned the flame   and Springsteen gets credit for that, according to Erik Kirschbaum:  They had never heard a message like that. Here was this big, famous American rock star who came into the middle of East Germany, into East Berlin, and told them he hoped that the wall would come down one day.",

        "content": "A groundbreaking vision and a controversial construction colour the fascinating history of one of the world s most iconic buildings, writes Jonathan Glancey.  It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.  With this ringing endorsement from Unesco in 2007, the Sydney Opera House was declared a World Heritage Site. The famous building, with its soaring, sail-like roofs, that is often said to define the city, country and continent, was promoted to join ranks with the Egyptian pyramids, the Great Wall of China and the cathedrals of Chartres and Durham. This must have been a deeply moving moment for Jorn Utzon (1918-2008), the brilliant and poetic architect of the Sydney Opera House. From now on, there could be no doubting the supremely special qualities of this astonishing yet once hugely controversial building, opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1973. Today, few of the 1.2 million people who buy tickets for performances each year, and many fewer perhaps of the seven million who come to Sydney s Bennelong Point from around the world to gawp at this architectural marvel, would ever think that its visionary architect was once treated like a pariah by the government that commissioned the building. The story is as dismal, and as necessary to recall, as the opera house is glorious. It had all begun happily enough when, in 1957, Utzon s proposal was chosen from the 233 entries in an international competition held by the government of New South Wales for the design of an opera house on the site of a tram depot fronting Sydney Harbour. The judges kept returning to the young Danish architect s thrilling drawings even after they had discarded them several times in favour of more obviously practical designs. Intuition won the day.  We are convinced , said the judges at last,  that they [Utzon s drawings] present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.  Out of touch Construction began in 1957 with the driving of 588 concrete piles into land in and around Sydney Harbour to support the huge new building. But, as delays increased and costs began to spiral, a new coalition conservative government voted into office in 1965, took Utzon to task. Like Gaudi   the architect of Barcelona s Sagrada Familia   before him, Utzon believed that the design of a building on this scale should evolve over time. Davis Hughes, the new minister of public works, representing a government that was not exactly culturally aware, demanded instant solutions including a full set of working drawings of the interiors to speed construction along.",
