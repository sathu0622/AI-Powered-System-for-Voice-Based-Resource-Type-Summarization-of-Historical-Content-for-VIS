        "content": "But Thutmose was determined to defy his enemies and, by taking the most dangerous route, show that he didn t fear them. He swore an oath by the sun god Amun-Re, saying:  My Majesty will march by this Aruna Road!  He also determined that he himself would lead the army through the narrow pass.  None shall march on this road in front of my Majesty and (when the time came) he himself did march at the head of his army, showing the way with his own steps.  The route he chose was just over eight miles long, with parts of it only 30 feet wide. With steep walls on either side, it was the perfect place for the enemy to ambush an advancing army from above, as there was no room for maneuver. However, assuming the Egyptians would never risk such reckless exposure, the enemy had only stationed soldiers on the other two paths. Thutmose s army was able to march the route through the Aruna pass in one day without any problem. The soldiers emerged into the Qina valley to the astonishment of enemy troops who were encamped near the city of Megiddo. (The last missing tomb from this wealthy Egyptian dynasty has been found) The Egyptian advance At dawn the following day the Egyptian army was mobilized, dividing and deploying in three large units that advanced in crescent formation toward an encampment of Asian forces to the south of Megiddo. The inscription at Karnak records that:  The southern wing of his Majesty s army was at a hill south of the Qina [brook], and the northern wing to the northwest of Megiddo, while his Majesty was in their center, [Amun] protecting his person (in) the tumult, and the strength of [Seth pervading] his limbs.

SCALA, FLORENCE MILITARY OFFICIALS of ancient Egypt who won fame and fortune could expect a lavish tomb. The achievements of Thutmose III s commander Amenemheb (nicknamed Mahu) are partially preserved on a wall of his tomb. They record that he fought in many Asian campaigns, killing and capturing enemies, amassing a substantial booty, and being rewarded by Thutmose III with promotions and expensive gifts. They also relate several curious episodes, such as when he killed a mare in heat that the ruler of Kadesh had sent into the ranks of Egyptian chariots to distract the horses, or when he helped the pharaoh kill an elephant after a military operation in Syria. This reference provides tantalizing evidence that the pharaohs of the time hunted elephants in the Syrian region of Niya after having fought their northern enemies. That maneuver sparked panic among the enemy warriors; many of them abandoned their tents and rushed toward Megiddo. The pharaoh s troops set about plundering their camp, which allowed many of the Asian forces to escape. A NARROW PASS Thutmose III leads his troops toward Megiddo through the perilous Aruna pass. Choosing this route was a bold initiative that allowed the pharaoh to surprise the enemy. BRIDGEMAN/ACI Some Asian commanders were hoisted to safety over the walls of Megiddo by those inside who were defending the city. Others must have run northward to get as far away from the Egyptian troops as possible. The chronicles point out with a certain bitterness that if the soldiers of Thutmose III had pursued the fleeing troops in that phase of the confrontation, the victory would have been quick and definitive:  When they [the enemy chiefs] saw his Majesty overwhelming them, they fled headlong [to] Megiddo with terrified faces, abandoning their horses, their chariots of gold and silver, so as to be hoisted up into the town by pulling at their garments. For the people had shut the town behind them, and they now [lowered] garments to hoist them up into the town. Now if his Majesty s troops had not set their hearts to plundering the possessions of the enemies, they would have [captured] Megiddo at this moment.  This portion was less of a battle and more like a series of skirmishes with the Egyptians on the offensive. MISSION MEGIDDO Located on a hill in the north of present-day Israel, Megiddo controlled the important trade route linking Egypt with Mesopotamia in the mid-15th century B.C. ALAMY/CORDON PRESS Siege and victory Faced with the impossibility of taking the city by assault, the Egyptians decided to besiege it, building a series of fortifications with wood they obtained by felling trees in the surrounding area. The Annals of Thutmose III show how he emphasized the strategic importance of conquering Megiddo:  Every prince of every [northern] land is shut up within it, the capture of Megiddo is the capture of a thousand cities!  Finally, after seven months of siege, the city surrendered. Among the enemy leaders captured inside was the ruler of Megiddo. The prince of Kadesh, commander in chief of the Asian coalition, did, however, manage to escape. The Aruna pass A key moment in Thutmose III s triumphant first campaign and conquest of Megiddo was the daring decision made by the pharaoh to enter the Aruna pass. The Canaanite forces had left this route unguarded, believing the pharaoh would not expose his army to the possibility of deadly attack from the high ground on either side of the gorge. By taking this risky route, the Egyptian forces were able to take their enemy by surprise at Megiddo, the fortress where the troops of the princes of Retjenu (as the Egyptians called the region of Syria and Canaan) were concentrated. The Egyptians gave their opponents no time to react. At dawn the next day, they were deployed in three divisions that advanced on the Canaanites and their allies with the intention of subduing their flanks and overwhelming them. Thutmose III was in the central division. Unable to resist the onslaught, the Asian troops fled in disarray and several of their leaders ran to take refuge in the walled city of Megiddo while the Egyptians were engaged in looting their camp. As the Megiddo fortress defenders had closed their gates to prevent the Egyptians from forcing their way in, the fleeing commanders had to be hoisted ignominiously over the city wall by ropes tied to their clothes. Megiddo would finally fall after seven months of siege. An extraordinary booty The written sources preserve a long and detailed list of the booty obtained after the conquest of Megiddo. They indicate that there were 83 enemy dead and 340 prisoners, but these figures may only include individuals who were seen as significant. The Jabal Barkal victory stele, erected by Thutmose III in Nubia, recounts several of his campaigns in Asia. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. FINE ARTS, BOSTON/SCALA, FLORENCE AFTER THE VICTORY AT MEGIDDO, Thutmose consolidated his power to the north, in Asia, and to the south, in Nubia. In the 33rd year of his reign, he launched a direct attack against the Mitanni Empire that had sponsored the anti-Egyptian unrest. Mitanni lay beyond the Euphrates River, so Thutmose transported boats by ox-drawn carts from the coastal city of Byblos (today in Lebanon). Using these boats, the Egyptians were able to cross the Euphrates, crushing the Mitanni state and strengthening Egypt s hold over the whole region. Thutmose III erected a victory stele far in the south of his lands at Jabal Barkal in Nubia, today in Sudan. He characterized himself as conqueror of both southerners and northerners  who massacres the tribes of Asia...and who smites the nomads of Nubia.  Apart from herds, provisions, and other objects, the Egyptian army took 2,041 horses; 924 chariots, among which were the chariots carved in gold belonging to the rulers of Kadesh and Megiddo; 200 sets of armor; and 502 composite bows. These bows, of Mesopotamian origin, were very expensive and highly sought after. The body armor, made of hardened leather or bronze mail, was innovative at that time. There is no mention of helmets, although their use was widespread during the rule of Thutmose III. This is demonstrated both by the lists of tributes from Asia and by the paintings in some private Theban tombs in which foreigners paying tribute are shown wearing helmets. (Nubian kings ruled Egypt for less than 100 years. Their influence lasted centuries.)

SCALA, FLORENCE Myth and might The immediate consequence of the victory was the consolidation of pharaonic control over much of what is today Israel and the Palestinian territories. The stunning victory, and expansion of the pharaoh s control, would live in the Egyptian imagination as the beginning of a new era of regional greatness. General Djehuty, appointed governor of the conquered areas by Thutmose, would later be immortalized as the hero in an ancient Egyptian tale,  The Taking of Joppa.  Recounting how Djehuty used his ingenuity to conquer the city of Joppa (modern-day Jaffa, near Tel Aviv, Israel) by smuggling soldiers into the city hidden in baskets, this story preceded the Trojan horse plot device used in Homer s epic poem The Iliad by centuries. It is also a likely source for the Arabic folk tale  Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,  in which the eponymous thieves attempt to smuggle themselves into a house in jars of lamp oil. THUTMOSE THE CONQUEROR This relief at the seventh pylon Karnak Temple Complex symbolizes the victories of Thutmose III over his enemies, who cower as he prepares to crush them with his mace. ALAMY/CORDON PRESS Beyond inspiring great stories, the Megiddo triumph forged new political and diplomatic realities across the region: The new Canaanite territory provided a closer starting point for Egypt to launch future campaigns into Mesopotamia. News of the impressive victory prompted monarchies in the Near East to send ambassadors to Thebes, capital of Egypt, with sumptuous gifts, hoping to curry favor with the pharaoh. (These crocodile mummies are unraveling a mystery) Following his victory, Thutmose III leveraged his position to expand Egypt s power in Asia through an ambitious program of conquests in Syria. The Annals inscribed on the walls of the Temple of Amun-Re at Karnak mention 16 other campaigns, although, in some cases, no details have been preserved. These military operations took place between 1454 and 1437 B.C. and can be divided into distinct phases. The first phase involved the conquest of important port cities, such as Ullaza and Simyra, to facilitate transport to and from Egypt and provide storage points. The second phase involved the occupation of much of central Syria, thereby neutralizing the strength of the city of Kadesh. The third phase consisted of a direct attack on Mitannian territories, while the fourth phase included a series of campaigns aimed at suppressing uprisings in certain conquered territories. Even accounting for Thutmose s campaign of self-mythologization, and the inevitable exaggeration that is built into the claims and boasts of the Annals of Thutmose III, many scholars view the details of this account as a reliable source. In fact, the Battle of Megiddo is one of the earliest well-documented battles of history. This major turning point not only expanded Egyptian territory but also marked the first solo success of one of the greatest military leaders in ancient Egypt.",

Indeed, Ramses II (sometimes called pharaoh Ramesses II) erected more monuments and statues and sired more children than any other pharaoh.

        "content": "For the past few weeks, the internet has been abuzz with stories about a secret city allegedly located under the Pyramids at Giza. A research team led by retired organic chemist Dr. Corrado Malanga and former academic and remote sensing expert Dr. Filippo Biondi, claim to have discovered and reconstructed enormous 38,000-year-old structures buried deep underneath the pyramid of Khafre at Giza. In a press conference held in Italy, Malanga and Biondi announced that through the development of a new proprietary method for interpreting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals, they were able to detect structures two kilometers beneath the Khafre pyramid. According to Malanga and Biondi, they discovered eight shafts, surrounded by spiral pathways, that connect to two 90-meter cube-shaped structures. Above the shafts, they claim to have found five structures connected to one another by passageways. Using what appears to be AI-generated reconstructions, they, and others, have hypothesized that these structures are part of a legendary ancient city or even a prehistoric power-generating structure (i.e. a power station). Rumors of hidden structures underneath the Giza plateau are nothing new. The idea dates to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus and intermittently bubbled to the surface of popular consciousness throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They became particularly popular among French scholars in the 19th century and again in the 20th century when American psychic Edgar Cayce popularized the idea that a secret hall of records was buried underneath the pyramid complex. The concept of a power station, allegedly built by aliens, has also been bouncing around pseudoscientific circles for a while. It is part of a broader conspiracy theory that credits impressive ancient architectural projects to aliens. (How cosmic rays helped find a tunnel in Egypt's Great Pyramid.) This newest iteration of the pyramid conspiracy theory has captured public attention because of the scientific credentials of its authors. In the past Malanga and Biondi published a peer-reviewed article on the internal structure of the Khafre pyramid. Though these newer sensational claims have not been peer-reviewed, and one of the authors is well known for publishing books about aliens, the combination of doctorates and an allegedly new technology has captured public attention. The story went viral and was picked up by InfoWars, Joe Rogan, Piers Morgan, and other critics of  mainstream archeology.",

In 1902, British archaeologists excavated him from his tomb carved into a limestone hillside in the Nuwayrat necropolis, more than 150 miles south of Cairo. While the pharaohs of his time built colossal monuments like the Great Pyramid of Giza, this man, likely a potter who lived 4,500 to 4,800 years ago, left behind a different kind of legacy: his exceptionally well-preserved DNA. (This ancient Egyptian woman may have died in childbirth) Somehow, his remains endured centuries of scorching Egyptian heat and even Nazi bombings while housed in Liverpool, England, during World War II. Now scientists have sequenced the first whole genome of an ancient Egyptian from intact DNA extracted from his teeth. The study, published Wednesday in Nature, describes the oldest Egyptian DNA ever recovered, radiocarbon dated to between 2855 and 2570 B.C. This was during the end of the Early Dynastic and the beginning of the Old Kingdom periods, when Egypt s rulers consolidated power and ushered in the  Age of the Pyramids.   There are hundreds, if not thousands, of ancient genomes from across the world,  says Linus Girdland-Flink, a biomolecular archaeologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and a co-corresponding author of the paper. To date, scientists have collected ancient DNA from Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Homo sapiens from 45,000 years ago.  Yet, Egypt has remained a kind of white spot on the map of this big puzzle of human genetic ancestry.  Previously, the oldest DNA recovered from ancient Egypt came from three mummies buried at the Abusir el-Meleq necropolis and dated between 787 and 23 B.C.

The tapestry was then taken to a secret storage location, according to the AFP , where it will be held before it makes its way to England. Until now, specifics of tapestry's removal from the museum in Bayeux had been scant, and the exact manner in which it will make its way to England remains a closely guarded secret. A spokesperson from the Bayeux Tapestry Museum declined to comment on the logistics of the operation, citing security reasons, and France s Ministry of Culture did not respond to multiple interview requests. Transporting the tapestry to England by plane has reportedly been ruled out partly due to a loss of climate control on the tarmac, and media reports speculate that the tapestry s trip will involve some form of overland transport,  possibly combining road and rail with a shuttle train.  Before Friday, the Bayeux Tapestry had been moved only twice the first time by Napoleon, who had it displayed in Paris in an effort to drum up support for a planned invasion of England, and the second time in the 1940s during the German Occupation. At one point, the Nazis even conspired to steal the artifact in order to advance a claim that the depicted conquerors were Vikings (and hence Germanic) rather than Normans. The Third Reich did succeed in absconding with a small piece of the cloth, which remained hidden in Germany for decades after the war and is due to be returned to France.",

        "title": "What was a drugstore like in medieval Europe?",
        "content": "Europeans in the Middle Ages were no strangers to diseases and plagues. When suffering from health problems, they did the same as people today: They looked to medicine in the hope for a cure, or at least for the easing of pain. People bought, ingested, or applied items that are still familiar potions, ointments, and pills. The chemistry of such medication, however, was very different, made from natural substances once believed to have curative, even miraculous, properties. These included precious stones (agate was a remedy for eye complaints, while jasper was thought to counter hemorrhoids); mineral waters; products derived from animals or even humans (nails, urine, blood); and, above all, a great variety of plants. A pharmacopoeia called De Materia Medica by the Greek physician Dioscorides was widely circulated both in the medieval West and the Arab and Muslim world. It included botanical descriptions and medicinal applications for hundreds of plants. Certain plants were credited with a wide range of curative properties. According to Dioscorides, the cyclamen plant can be made into a potion and used to treat everything from jaundice and headaches to constipation, chilblains, acne, and alopecia. Spice merchants (e piciers in French, speziali in Italian) had close ties with apothecaries, as some of the spices they traded from the East were believed to have medicinal properties. Cinnamon and anise, for example, were used to prevent bad breath. Lotions, potions, and poultices would sometimes be prepared by itinerant healers who sold their wares in the streets or door-to-door. But there were also dispensaries called apothecaries (from the Greek word meaning  storehouse ), the precursors of modern pharmacies and drugstores. (The gory history of Europeans eating mummies for health) Nature cure A garden in a 15th-century French miniature, British Library. ALBUM Monasteries often had a special garden or herbularius dedicated to cultivating medicinal plants, known in French as simples, a word that entered English usage. The plants were placed in square beds separated by pathways. Monk hospital The origin of these apothecaries is closely linked to convents, monasteries, and abbeys. Monastic foundations often had places where they could offer hospitality to pilgrims and the poor. Since many of those using these houses, called hospitals, were also sick, the monks sought ways to treat their ailments, and so the word  hospital  acquired its modern sense Monks were suited to be physicians. They had access to scientific books in their libraries, such as the treatise by Dioscorides, and many other texts in circulation in medieval Europe and the Muslim world. They also had the physical resources. Based on their knowledge, monks knew which medicinal plants to cultivate in their monastery gardens. In this way, the first pharmacies were established as distinct rooms or spaces. In Camaldoli, east of Florence, in the 11th century, a monk named Romuald founded a community of Benedictine monks who ran a hospital for the poor. The pharmacy at Camaldoli was referenced as early as 1048. Sixteenth-century sources describe the provision of medicinal herbs from the well-stocked botanical garden.",

        "content": "The global spice trade is rooted in more than 500 years of colonialism, marked by long supply chains, little transparency, and farmers paid a pittance for their labor. Spices often sit in transit between grower and grocer for years, losing potency in the process. So Javeri Kadri invested the only money she had about $3,000 from her tax refund to buy the freshest turmeric she could find and bring it to California.  I was hand-packing it in my basement and then selling it on the internet,  she remembers. Thanks to a knack for Instagram marketing and a few key contacts in the food world, the business took off. Today Javeri Kadri s Diaspora Co. offers 41 spices, including black peppercorn and cardamom, and spice blends sourced from India and Sri Lanka. Unlike conventional spice companies, Diaspora deals directly with more than 150 farms, reaching thousands of farmworkers while paying them, on average, four times the commodity price for the organic spices they grow. (Fairtrade International, by comparison, pays just 15 percent above market.) The high-quality product allows the company to charge a premium, which has led to more investment in its farm partners. Javeri Kadri s strategy for coaxing people to pay more has been in part to focus on making the difference in quality and potency undeniable.  Before we launch something, we re buying every single competitor and directly comparing, literally in an unhinged way, to make sure that ours is the best out there,  she says. Her company is continuing to offer customers an unmatched level of transparency, sharing not just information about the farms on which each spice is grown but also harvest dates and contract prices. Javeri Kadri says that today one of Diaspora s primary corporate goals is for its farm partners to be able to pay workers enough to lift them above the poverty line. She estimates that the business will need to grow tenfold to reach that bar. Getting there is mostly a matter of encouraging more people to discover why a beautiful black peppercorn or cardamom pod, like great olive oil or wine, is a thing worth splurging on.  Because we re sourcing from South Asia, I think there s a very problematic assumption that it should be cheap,  she says.  That s basically the effects of colonialism and racism, where we re devaluing this labor and we re devaluing the worth of this product.  Meanwhile, the company recently expanded into Whole Foods and wholesale distribution. There s a difference you can taste.",

        "content": "Banditry and bribery Forty years later, after France was engulfed in revolution, King Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette were arrested in 1791 while trying to flee the country. With the monarchs imprisoned, the French Royal Treasury was turned over to the nascent government. In mid-September 1792, as a wave of rioting engulfed Paris, thieves broke into the Royal Storehouse, the Garde-Meuble, and stole most of the French Crown Jewels over the course of five nights. One of the world s few flawless diamonds, the so-called Regent was added to France s crown jewels in 1717 by the Duke of Orleans, regent of France for Louis XV. It was among the treasures stolen in 1792, but was recovered a year later. After the revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte adorned his swords with it. Today it can be found in Paris on display at the Louvre Museum. STE PHANE MARE CHELLE/RMN One of the thieves, Cadet Guillot Lordonner, left Paris with the insignia of the Golden Fleece. He removed the French Blue from the setting along with the Co te de Bretagne spinel, a red gemstone carved in the shape of a dragon. Once in London, he tried unsuccessfully to sell the Co te de Bretagne to exiled French monarchists and ended up in debtors  prison. The Co te de Bretagne would rejoin the French Crown Jewels, along with a good portion of the stolen loot, but the French Blue had vanished. (Another French mystery: Who was the \"Man in the Iron Mask?\") Some chroniclers believe that the French Blue didn t go to London with Lordonner. Instead, it arrived much later in a scenario worthy of a political thriller. According to this theory, the revolutionary armies desperately needed a victory around the time Austria and Prussia were threatening to invade France in 1792. Led by the Prussian Duke of Brunswick, an invasion was repelled by the French at Valmy and retreated back over the Rhine on September 20. Revolutionary momentum returned and fervor soared. Sunlight streams through the Apollo Gallery in Paris s Louvre Museum, which showcases France s royal regalia, gems, crowns, and diadems. SYLVAIN SONNET/ALAMY/ACI Skeptics questioned how an experienced and well-equipped Prussian general could be defeated so quickly. They theorized that revolutionary leaders had orchestrated the jewel heist earlier that month in order to bribe the Duke of Brunswick. They would give him the French Blue in return for losing the battle at Valmy. Theorists suspect that years later Brunswick sent the Blue to his daughter, Princess Caroline, in London in 1805.

        "content": "Early one June morning in 1837, a few weeks after her 18th birthday, Princess Victoria was awoken by her mother to greet the Archbishop of Canterbury, who delivered the news that King William IV had just died. Victoria, still in her nightdress, had become queen. That night she wrote in her journal:  Very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what is fit and right than I have.  Victoria s accession marked a significant change. Gone were the old men who had ruled for half a century, replaced by a young queen soon to have her own family. As the future British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli told the House of Commons in a speech in 1861:  She who reigns over us has elected amid all the splendor of empire, to establish her life on the principle of domestic love.  The royal family represented youth, morality, and domesticity now. Changed, too, were the regalia worn by monarchies past. A teenage queen who stood at less than five feet tall needed better-proportioned displays of royal authority. A new coronation ring was made for Victoria, and the shafts of the scepters were altered to enable her to hold them comfortably. The Jewel in the Woman s Crown Among Victoria s magnificent jewels was the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which passed into her possession after the British conquered the Sikh empire in 1849. In this 1856 portrait, the young Victoria wears it as a brooch.

He also presented his wife with jewelry of his own design, such as the sapphire and diamond brooch he gave her before their wedding, and a gold and porcelain set, which included a brooch, earrings, and necklace that recalled the wreath of orange blossoms she wore on their wedding day.

        "content": "Since 1759, when the first Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease on St James s Gate Brewery in Dublin, generations of Guinnesses have grown the business, along with a vast fortune and a family legacy based on philanthropy as much as their stout. Ad House of Guinness, a drama now streaming on Netflix, explores a chapter of that fascinating family history in the way that only Peaky Blinders and SAS Rogue Heroes creator Steven Knight can. Starring a riotously charming Anthony Boyle (of Masters of the Air fame) as Arthur Guinness, the eight-part series bills itself as a 19th-century Succession, complete with sibling rivalries, political intrigue and a rebellious spirit   all mixed down with plenty of pints. Who was the real Arthur Guinness? The Arthur Guinness of House of Guinness is not the one who founded the brewery back in 1759. This is his great-grandson, Arthur Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun. He ran the brewery business alongside his brother Edward from 1868 to 1876, as well as sitting in the House of Commons as an MP and giving generously to a host of humanitarian causes. Born on 1 November 1840 in Dublin, Arthur was the eldest son of Elizabeth and Benjamin Lee Guinness, the man responsible for turning the brewery into a truly global giant. Growing up with two brothers, Benjamin and Edward, and a sister, Anne, he received an elite education at Eton and Trinity College Dublin, graduating in 1862. A statue of Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun, at St Stephen s Green in Dublin, a 22-acre public park that Arthur bought, landscaped and gifted to the city. (Image by Alamy) During its first three generations, Guinness had become the largest brewery in Ireland and a major exporter to Europe, the Americas and parts of Africa. Under the stewardship of Arthur and his youngest brother, Edward Guinness, the brewery continued to thrive; even the temperance movement, which bemoaned the social ills of alcohol, promoted the stout as a preferred alternative to spirits like gin and whiskey. What was Arthur s involvement in the brewery? For Arthur, 1868 would be a life-changing year, beginning with the death of his father. He was elevated to the title of Baronet Guinness of Ashford, which had been created just a year earlier to mark Benjamin Lee s achievements. His father left a fortune of  1.1 million (well over  100 million today) and the Guinness Brewery, the management of which became a partnership between Arthur and the youngest son, Edward. While the middle brother Benjamin and sister Anne received estates and money, they had no say in the business. In the first decade of their ownership, the success of Guinness only expanded, with sales more than doubling from around 350,000 barrels sold in 1868 to almost 779,000 in 1876. In the decades that followed, it would rise to more than a million a year. Was Arthur Guinness a philanthropist? As a major landowner in rural Ireland, Arthur had hundreds of poor tenants. Although more attentive than many landlords, this got him embroiled in the agrarian unrest and occasional violence of the 1880s, known as the Land War, in which several of his employees were murdered. Generally, though, he was considered a generous and conscientious figure, having learned the creed of the Guinness family to favour philanthropy and social responsibility over greed. Did Arthur Guinness commit election fraud? The year 1868 also saw Arthur s election to the UK Parliament as a Conservative MP for the City of Dublin, the seat previously been held by his father. Only a year later, however, the election was voided when it emerged that Guinness agents had used tactics that amounted to corruption and bribery, even offering  5 for every vote. When the matter went to court, it was concluded that Arthur himself had no idea this had happened.

(Image by Ben Blackall/Netflix) It would be another five years before he could win his seat back, in 1874, when he served under the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli until 1880. This was a time of widening divide in Ireland, between the Unionists who wished to stay part of the United Kingdom and nationalists seeking independence. Religion similarly divided the Irish between Protestant and Catholic. Read more | Who was to blame for the Irish famine? Arthur was a staunch Unionist and Protestant, as all generations of his family had been. In later life, he bought two Unionist newspapers and supported the Irish Unionist Alliance, and the Guinness Brewery s clear stance was cause for some anger among republicans. In 1880, Arthur left the House of Commons as he was raised to the peerage as Baron Ardilaun. What s known about Arthur Guinness s sexuality? In 1871, Arthur married Lady Olivia Charlotte Hedges-White, daughter of the Earl of Bantry. It seemed to be a happy marriage, although childless. The couple became known for their extravagant hospitality, hosting both Queen Victoria and the future George V, and they travelled widely. According to Joe Joyce, author of 2009 The Guinnesses: The Untold Story of Ireland s Most Successful Family, Arthur was  probably gay . Joyce also reported that both Arthur Guinness and the Baroness Ardilaun were content in maintaining the marriage under the agreement that there would be no sexual intercourse. It s a slender claim that the show has taken to heart and run with to riotous conclusions. Certainly, there was no way that same-sex relationships could have been accepted in tandem with success in public life   male homosexuality was legislated against in UK law, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. \"Sodomy (or buggery) were previously a hanging offence in Britain,\" writes Brian Lewis. \"This was modified by the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which replaced capital punishment with minimum sentences of 10 years  imprisonment. The Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 added to the statute book a two-year maximum penalty for 'gross indecency' between men.\" What happened to Arthur Guinness after the events of House of Guinness? In 1876, Arthur made the decision to step back from the brewery, selling his half of the shares to his brother for nearly  700,000. Although that figure made the younger Guinness a fabulously wealthy man, Edward would float the business a few years later on the London Stock Exchange, which made him a multi-millionaire. Arthur helped restore Marsh s Library and extend the Coombe Hospital in Dublin; he sponsored the building of housing for the poor; and, along with his brother, set up the Dublin Exhibition of Arts and Finance to encourage domestic trade. To this day, people can visit St Stephen s Green, a 22-acre public park that Arthur bought, landscaped and gifted to the city in the 1870s and 80s. Was Arthur Guinness assassinated? No, Arthur Guinness was not assassinated, or ever targeted by a Fenian plot to assassinate him. Arthur died on 20 January 1915, at the age of 74. He would be buried in the Dublin suburb of Raheny at All Saints  Church, the building of which he had helped fund several decades earlier. Ad House of Guinness is streaming on Netflix now.

        "title": "Shakespeare s 'lost years': what do we know about this secretive chapter of the bard's life?",
        "content": "The idea that William Shakespeare s life contains a stretch of  lost years  is a minor ghost that haunts popular biographies and discussion of his poems and plays. Those missing years are conventionally taken to begin in February 1585, when Shakespeare s children   twins Judith and Hamnet   were baptised at Stratford upon Avon, and to end in September 1592, when he was described as being  an upstart Crow  in a gossipy pamphlet in London. Ad Between these dates, we have no reliable record that ties Shakespeare to any particular location, or reveals what he was doing. Shakespeare was 20 when his lost years began, and 28 when they ended. Those seven-and-a-half lost years belong in a wider landscape in which we know remarkably little about the playwright. We know virtually nothing for sure about Shakespeare s schooling, which he probably completed in 1578 or so; nor what he did until he married Anne Hathaway in November 1582. Listen on the podcast | What happened in Shakespeare's lost years? This is not only the case for Shakespeare: scholars may hate to admit it, but our ignorance of so much of this period is vast. Almost 60 per cent of the 3,000 different plays written between 1570 and 1642 are lost. While some titles survive, there could be some lost plays that we have never even heard of at all. It is a safe guess, but a guess nonetheless, that plays by Shakespeare are among these wholly lost plays. We are uncertain of even the most basic things. Until the remains of the Elizabethan Curtain playhouse in Shoreditch, London, were discovered in 2012, theatre historians assumed that it was round; it turned out to be rectangular. Why the lost years matter Shakespeare s undocumented years have a special quality: enigmatic, evocative and instructive. As those years began, Shakespeare was a young man in a provincial town who had written nothing and had few prospects. When they ended, he was celebrated enough as a playwright to be worth attacking. The lost years are exactly the period of his genesis as a writer. What has filled those years is a series of guesses and rumours. Half a century after Shakespeare s death, the 17th-century antiquarian John Aubrey began collecting anecdotes and stories about Shakespeare from people who had known him, notably the son of an actor who had been a member of Shakespeare s company. The lost years are exactly the period of his genesis as a writer Aubrey recounts, in his Brief Lives   a collection of short biographies   two slightly different stories about those lost years.  This William being inclined naturally to Poetry and acting,  Aubrey wrote,  came to London I guess about 18 and was an Actor at one of the Play-houses and did act exceedingly well.  Then a little later, he added:  he had been in his younger years a School-master in the Country.  The two stories don t quite fit together: a diligent, rural Shakespeare versus a theatrical, London one. But they establish the two main traditions of thinking about this time. Shakespeare, depicted in a later image based on a contemporary portrait. His dramatic works shed light on Elizabethan and Jacobean society, and on views of history. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) The writer and poet Nicholas Rowe prepared the first real biography of Shakespeare for his own edition of Shakespeare s plays published in 1709. Rowe had apparently not read Aubrey, but he offers an expanded version of the first idea. He repeats a Stratford legend, that the young Shakespeare fell into  ill company  and poached a deer from a local gentleman. The ensuing trouble meant he had to flee to London, where he found work at a playhouse. There, suggests Rowe,  his admirable Wit, and the natural Turn of it to the Stage, soon distinguish d him, if not as an extraordinary actor, yet as an excellent Writer . Read more | Did someone else write the plays of William Shakespeare? The real history that debunks the conspiracy This is an echo, or revision, of Aubrey s first story. Another version, which circulated in the 17th century, was that the young Shakespeare held the horses at the playhouse door. The alternative and less thespian description of Shakespeare also pops up in the early biographies. Edmond Malone, in his great edition of the plays (1790) and the biographical essay which accompanies it, extended Rowe s biography into a much more reliable timeline of Shakespeare s life and works. This edition is the foundation of much later textual study, and while it is a mountain of scholarship it is not without a little sentimental speculation. In it, Malone speculates that after leaving school, Shakespeare was  employed, while he yet remained at Stratford, in the office of some country attorney . Perhaps so: it is worth noting that Malone himself had trained as a barrister. Along with the development of Shakespeare biography, and the beginnings of careful scholarly work on the texts of the plays, came the realisation that some things were unknown. We might say that the lost years are really a sign of how much has been found; it was only once much was known, with some degree of confidence, that the idea of  lost years  emerged. In a further apparent paradox, in the early 20th century the phrase itself became less an admission of ignorance than a boast about knowledge. Player, teacher, clerk? Those keenest to use the phrase have been those most sure they have the answer. Arthur Acheson s 1920 book Shakespeare s Lost Years in London, 1586-1592 confidently uses the phrase  lost years    and sometimes  dark years    to refer to this specific period, but only to find them to be not so lost at all. His book discovers Shakespeare, as in Rowe, arriving early in London. E A J Honigmann s 1985 book Shakespeare: The  Lost Years  places him back in the countryside: in Lancashire, working in the household of a Catholic family in Lancashire, perhaps as a player (actor), or a tutor. In each case, that  lost  is rhetorical. There is no evidence that he was not, say, a pirate or a mercenary in those years Shakespeare the player, the teacher, the clerk: the timidity of the suggestions is revealing. There is no evidence that he was not, say, a pirate or a mercenary in those years. But what he wasn t tells us much about him. Shakespeare was not at university, while so many of his contemporary playwrights were. He was not a spy, while his great rival Christopher Marlowe was, in the same period of his life. The lost years mark him as apart and this is why they matter both as an episode and a story. They say: here is a mystery. Your attempt to solve it may reveal something only about you. Shakespeare got there first, of course.

        "content": "Think of Roman engineering, and it might be the grandest feats that first come to mind: the towering aqueducts bringing water to towns and cities, the amphitheatres filled with cheering crowds, and the paved roads that stitched the Roman empire together. Ad The hypocaust   the Roman system of underfloor heating   may be less staggering in its scale, but it remains one of the most recognisable features of Roman domestic life. Archaeologists still point to those distinctive stacks of bricks beneath villa floors as a mark of Roman sophistication.  The hypocaust system is really important for us to think about when we consider Roman homes,  explains Dr Hannah Platts on the HistoryExtra podcast.  It was important to them: that it heated their baths and their other spaces.  But they weren t for everyone. Who owned homes with underfloor heating? And what did such comfort say about status and power?  I should reiterate, having your own bathhouse or having a hypocaust was a luxury,  says Platts. Rome s underfloor miracle At its simplest, a hypocaust worked by circulating hot air through a hollow space beneath the floor. A furnace, or praefurnium, was stoked outside the building; hot air from the furnace was funnelled into a network of small brick pillars (pilae) that supported a raised floor. But it wasn t just about heating the floor. Read more | How and why did the Roman empire fall?  The hypocaust was used to heat houses via underfloor heating, but actually we ve got a number of houses where we ve got evidence of box flue tiles in the walls,  says Platts.  So we know that hypocausts could heat the walls of the rooms as well.  In the context of ancient Rome this was engineering of incredible sophistication. Archaeological remains from sites such as Pompeii and Ostia, and across Roman Britain, show entire suites of rooms heated by the system. Stepping barefoot on a mosaic floor, warmed from underneath, was quite literally to step upon Roman ingenuity. The Roman baths at Salamis, dating to the 3rd century, feature a well-preserved hypocaust system beneath the tepidarium, or warm room. This network of brick pillars once channelled hot air under and through the floors. (Photo by Getty Images) From the baths to the villa The hypocaust began as a public luxury, eventually exported to private homes. The earliest examples appeared in the great bath complexes (thermae) of the late republic and early empire. Roman baths were vast public leisure centres and required consistent, large-scale heating. The first recorded Roman hypocausts date to the first century BC, developed under architects and engineers serving figures such as Marcus Agrippa, the ally and later son-in-law of the Roman emperor Augustus. Under Augustus himself, public bathhouses multiplied across Rome and its provinces. The technique soon spread to private villas, where the wealthy adapted public comfort for domestic display. By the second century AD, during the reigns of emperors such as Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, the hypocaust had become a standard feature of elite architecture across the empire   from the Mediterranean heartlands to the frontier forts of Britain. The price of luxury But this warmth came at a cost.  We know that the idea of heating your house was really important, but it wasn t for everyone,  says Platts.  To have a hypocaust system in one s house was a big sign of wealth. It would generally only have been present in examples of really opulent and wealthy dwellings: dwellings that, for example, might have their own private bathhouses.  They didn t even need to go to the general baths. They could just have fun in their own spaces.  And, Platts says, what often goes forgotten is that maintaining heat from a hypocaust was hard. Read more | Everything you wanted to know about the Roman emperors  It took significant effort to build [and] to maintain,  says Platts. Fires had to be constantly fed with wood, ash cleared away and airways cleaned.  There s engineering skill behind it too,  says Platts.  Not everyone is going to be able to build a hypocaust. There is a huge amount of skill behind that building process, and then you ve actually got to be able to run the hypocaust and have it working. It really would ve taken considerable finances to build a hypocaust within your house.  The result was that the hypocaust became an unmistakable badge of wealth. Visitors entering a villa with warm floors knew instantly that they stood in the home of someone of status. This Roman mosaic from Sousse, Tunisia, shows the poet Virgil seated between the muses Clio and Melpomene as he writes the Aeneid. (Photo by Getty Images) The Roman world of privilege and luxury The hypocaust was one element within the broader picture of Roman luxury. For the upper classes, architecture, fashion, and food all worked together to display wealth and taste.  What also would be luxuries could be the way in which people spent their fortunes in other ways,  Platts says.  I m thinking about fashionable clothing, or elaborate jewellery or gemstones. Romans loved amber. They loved pearls. They had quite a thing for uncut diamonds   as we all might   and things that were imported: ivory imported from Africa, silks imported from towards China.  The global reach of the Roman empire fed its appetite for exotic goods. To own these luxuries, to eat peppered dishes and dress in silk, was to embody the luxuries of empire.  Anything like fine wines, exotic spices, was a really good way of showing your status,  Platts notes. In this way, food became another way to demonstrate power. Enslaved servants circulated trays of imported delicacies from Britain, Syria and Africa, served to guests in rooms warmed by the hypocaust. Living symbols of servitude Luxury in Rome was also inseparable from labour, says Platts.  Whilst owning a slave in and of itself was not a luxury   Rome was a slave-based economy, and actually, even many of the really relatively poor households would likely have one or two enslaved people living under their roofs   the number of slaves you had, where they came from, and how skilled they were, that really was a sign of wealth and luxury.  For the Roman elites, warm homes   and the people who kept them running   were signs of sophistication and wealth combined. The hypocaust might not have been as spectacular as an aqueduct or as imposing as an amphitheatre, but it does symbolise a crucial fact of ethos of the Roman empire: it shows how innovative engineering served comfort for the wealthy as much as conquest on the frontiers.

        "title": "Ancient Roman theatre was a powerful weapon of empire, so why were actors' lives so tragic?",
        "content": "Roman society was acutely hierarchical. Every occupation carried a moral weight, and the line between dignity and dishonour was a stark one. A senator who spoke in the law courts could win eternal repute, but a gladiator who risked his life to entertain the masses was branded socially devalued, and the same was true of actors. Ad No matter how dazzling their performances in front of a packed theatre might be, their profession consigned them to the lowest rungs of society. By law they were infamis; people of ill repute, stripped of civic rights and grouped alongside the enslaved. But what was this paradoxical life of stardom and shame really like for the actors of the Roman empire? Roman theatre s golden age under Augustus  When we talk about a golden age of Roman theatre, we tend to be talking about Emperor Augustus s reign and the beginning of the Roman empire,  says Jessica Clarke, author of A New History of Ancient Roman Theatre, speaking on the HistoryExtra podcast.  This was a period with new cultural, religious and political structures being implemented.  Augustus was the first emperor of Rome, ruling from 27 BC until AD 14. And he grasped how useful theatre could be as a political tool. Read more | The worst Roman emperors Spectacle was part of a strategy that Romans would come to call panem et circenses, or bread and circuses: free food and entertainment offered to the populace in return for loyalty and social cohesion. Drama and performance helped bind audiences into a shared Roman identity and provided a stage (quite literally) for imperial ideology. This 1st-century AD mosaic from the House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii depicts the staging of a theatrical performance. Such scenes highlight the importance of theatre in Roman cultural life, blending entertainment with expressions of myth, satire, and social commentary. (Photo by Getty Images) A web of theatres across the Roman empire  Augustus built hundreds of theatres across the Roman empire, all following the design of the theatre that he also built for himself in Rome,  Clarke explains.  These theatres are enormous, they re spread across all of the provinces. Essentially, what he built was a web of entertainment venues that Rome was in charge of.  These theatres were architectural marvels in themselves. The Theatre of Marcellus in Rome, inaugurated by Augustus in 13 BC and named after his nephew, could seat more than 10,000 people. Its semicircular rows of stone seating rose above a wide orchestra space and a stage backed by the towering scaenae frons; a richly decorated permanent backdrop of columns, niches and statues. Men and women alike could attend the performances at this new wave of theatres, (unlike in Greece, where women were mostly banned from attending) and seating was arranged by social rank, with senators and equestrians   members of the second-highest social class   in prime positions, and the poor higher up. Performances ranged from solemn tragedies to ribald comedies, farcical mimes and elaborate pantomimes accompanied by music and dance. Admission was usually free, funded by magistrates or emperors seeking popularity. Who performed and who was excluded The Roman stage, however, was overwhelmingly male. As in Greece, women were largely banned from treading the boards. Clarke points to the existence of scant evidence of female performers in mime and pantomime   forms considered lower status and more risqu    but official theatre roles were reserved for men.  It s quite similar to Shakespearean rules around who is allowed to step onto a stage,  says Clarke.  Though it would have been slightly easier for men to play the female roles because they had masks on.  Masks, made of linen and plaster or occasionally wood, were central to performance, and not just because they made it easier for men to portray women; they exaggerated expressions and amplified voices too.

Listen to all episodes now On the Ides of March 44 BC, the most famous Roman in history was murdered. Julius Caesar's assassination transformed Rome forever, and the image of his bloody toga has haunted monarchs and tyrants ever since. Actors as infamis No amount of training or talent could lift an actor out of the social stigma that came with the role.  In ancient Rome, acting was an incredibly lowly profession,  says Clarke.  It wasn t something that was seen as an acceptable job for a Roman citizen to undertake. An actor was in the class known as infamis.  This was the same class as a slave; the same class as a prostitute. You would have no voting rights, and you also don t have bodily autonomy, so you don t have legal rights over your body,  Clarke explains. Why this disdain? Roman moralists believed that a respectable citizen should preserve dignitas (dignity) and gravitas (seriousness). To display one s body on stage, to impersonate others, or to provoke laughter was considered undignified. The actor sold their body and voice for public pleasure, which made the profession inherently shameful. This attitude was consistent with how Roman society viewed other entertainers. Gladiators might achieve celebrity in the arena, and charioteers could command passionate fan followings, but both were technically degraded in status. Performers were celebrated in spectacle but lacked any standing in civic life. The life of a Roman actor Evidence from inscriptions, satirical writings and contracts paints a picture of precariousness. Troupes travelled from town to town, dependent on festivals and civic sponsorship for work, while pay was unreliable; some actors received generous gifts, others little more than food and board. The constant would have been the rehearsals. Actors trained their voices to carry across open-air theatres, practised precise gestures codified to signal emotions and maintained the masks, costumes and props essential for performance. Injuries would have been common, especially in physical pantomimes involving acrobatics. Read more | The overshadowed ancient empire that rivalled Rome with maritime might and an iron fist  But that doesn t mean that we don t know about some very famous actors,  says Clarke.  One we know of is called Clodius Aesopus. He was the most famous tragic actor in the late Republic. Cicero was friends with him.  Aesopus, active in the first century BC, was celebrated for bringing Greek classics to Roman audiences. As Clarke notes, he became a personal acquaintance of Marcus Tullius Cicero, one of Rome s greatest statesmen, orators and philosophers, whose speeches still survive as masterpieces of Latin prose. That such a figure could publicly befriend an actor underscores the inherent paradox: Aesopus was admired, wealthy and socially connected, yet in law he remained infamis. Life as a Roman actor was full of strange contradictions. The art form of theatre was a powerful political tool, theatres themselves were magnificent constructions, audiences were vast and enthusiastic, and some performers became famous enough to mingle with Rome s elite. Yet the profession itself stripped actors of rights and respect. It was a life lived in the spotlight, but without dignity.

        "title": "The Strange Christian Afterlife of Pontius Pilate",
        "content": "Towards the end of the second century AD the pagan intellectual Celsus wrote an anti-Christian treatise mocking belief in Jesus Christ. If Jesus really had been the Son of God, he asked, why hadn t God punished Pontius Pilate, the man responsible for crucifying him? Why had Pilate not been driven insane or torn apart, like the characters in Greek myths? Why had no calamity befallen him? While there are plenty of later Christian traditions about the punishment of Pontius Pilate, all of these seem to belong to a period long after Celsus was writing. Celsus  challenge, and the response of early Christians to it, suggests that there was more than a kernel of truth in the claim that the Prefect of Judaea had evaded misfortune. This is implicit from the efforts early Christians made to absolve him of responsibility for the Crucifixion. The only reliable statement we have about Pilate s life after his time in Judaea comes from the pen of the Jewish writer Josephus. In his Antiquities of the Jews, written about 60 years after the events, Josephus states that Pilate was recalled to Rome after his mishandling of a riot involving the Samaritans in AD 36. For this he would have expected to face a hearing before the Emperor Tiberius, the aged but uncompromising ruler who had appointed him ten years earlier. Pilate hurried back, but by the time he arrived, in March AD 37, the ailing Tiberius had died. A new emperor, Caligula, had taken up the reins of power. What happened next is guesswork. Josephus says nothing more about him, implying that there was no hearing. Perhaps, in the general euphoria surrounding Caligula s accession, his case was put on hold, or simply forgotten. Maybe the hearing did go ahead and he was acquitted. For all we know, he was given another posting. The lack of a suitably grisly fate for Pilate put Christian apologists in a quandary. As governor, it was Pilate s job to pass judgement in capital cases: he was the one who condemned Jesus to suffer on the cross. There was no circumventing his guilt. Divine punishment should have followed. Yet in the early years of Christianity it was difficult to make such claims. The Roman state was suspicious of the new cult and, if Christians wanted to avoid confrontation, it was best not to accuse one of Rome s officials of deicide. The canonical Gospels stressed that Pilate was not fully to blame. He could find no fault in Jesus:  I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him , Pilate declares in Luke s Gospel. John has Pilate twice announce  I find no basis for a charge against him . The apocryphal Gospel of Peter, thought by many scholars to be among the earliest Christian texts, went even further. In this, Pilate and his soldiers play no part in the crowd s mocking or torturing of Jesus. He himself declares  I am pure from the blood of the Son of God  and, together with his soldiers, who guard the tomb of Jesus, he conspires to keep the miracle of the Resurrection secret from the Jewish priests. The tradition of a blameless Pilate, a witness to the Passion, led to a strange early Christian fascination with him. By the second century AD, fake letters of Pilate, recounting the wondrous story of Jesus, circulated among the faithful. The so-called Acts of Pilate, allegedly deriving from the governor s own records, portray Pilate as a convert. Tertullian, the late second-century Christian theologian, described Pilate as someone  who himself also in his own conscience was now a Christian  and alleged that Tiberius was so convinced by Pilate s reports that he would have placed Jesus among the Roman gods had not the Senate refused. So influential were the various versions of the Acts of Pilate that in the early fourth century the Roman state created and promoted an anti-Christian,  true , pagan version in an attempt to discredit the Christian ones. Needless to say this was no more reliable than its rivals. All of this might seem merely capricious, but the absolution of Pilate came at a terrible cost. The early Christians shifted the blame for the Crucifixion onto others. A rebuttal of the arguments of Celsus, written by the third-century bishop Origen, shows this clearly:  It was not so much Pilate that condemned Him,  he wrote,  as the Jewish nation . Celsus had chosen the wrong culprit; and the fact that the Jewish nation had been torn apart by the Romans and dispersed across the face of the earth was proof of God s retribution. The fake letters and the Christian versions of the Acts of Pilate said much the same thing, as did other Christian apologists. The Acts went so far as to have the Jewish crowd telling Pilate that they willingly accept the blood-guilt, an echo of the Gospel of Matthew, which has the same crowd shouting  his blood be on us and our children!  These claims formed a basis for Christian persecution of the Jews right up to modern times. Pilate s costly absolution was the product of specific religious and political circumstances. When the Roman Empire became a Christian state in the fourth century, there was no longer any need to emphasise his innocence. The Nicene Creed, formulated under Emperor Constantine in AD 325 and emended in AD 381, stated bluntly that Christ  was crucified under Pontius Pilate . It became acceptable to cast Pilate as a villain and a range of myths developed describing his grisly end. Some influential Christians demurred, however. Saint Augustine, writing in the sixth century, argued that when Pilate wrote on the cross  Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews , he really meant it:  It could not be torn from his heart that Jesus was the King of the Jews.  While the West went on to develop the tradition of a  bad  Pilate who was punished for his misdeeds, the Eastern Church preferred a more sympathetic interpretation. Not only was Pilate a Christian; he was a confessor and even a martyr. One eastern text, The Handing Over of Pilate, has Tiberius ordering the governor to be beheaded for having allowed the Crucifixion to go ahead. First Pilate repents and then a voice from heaven proclaims that all nations will bless him, because under his governorship the prophecies about Christ were fulfilled. Finally an angel takes charge of his severed head. In some accounts he is buried with his wife and two children next to the tomb of Jesus   the ultimate martyr s sepulchre. In the Gospel of Matthew, Pilate s wife warns her husband not to harm Jesus and for this she achieved sainthood among Orthodox Christians. The Copts and Christians of Ethiopia took the next step and canonised Pilate himself. An Ethiopian collection of hagiographies lists St Pilate s Day as the 25th of the summer month of Sanne, a day shared with his wife Procla and the saints Jude, Peter and Paul: Salutation to Pilate, who washed his hands To show he himself was innocent of the blood of Jesus Christ Those familiar with the western tradition may find the idea of St Pontius Pilate curious or even absurd. But the fascination with Pilate never abates. From the Acts of Pilate to Mikhail Bulgakov s novel The Master and Margerita, the man who cross-examined and crucified Jesus remains an enigma, a shadowy metaphor for opposites: equivocation and stubbornness, cowardice and heroism, cruelty and clemency. His dilemma   to do the right thing or the popular thing   is every ruler s quandary. Perhaps that is why people can sympathise with him: we too must sometimes face a difficult choice; though, fortunately for us, its legacy is likely to be less enduring.

        "title": "Whose Authority?",
        "content": "How did the idea of a European secular society come about? In this startlingly original book, David Lloyd Dusenbury argues that the separation of politics and religion, of  church and state , can be attributed to a thread of Christian thought rooted in the Gospel accounts of the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate and in subsequent discourses over whether or not Pilate could be held guilty of having ordered  the death of God . This is not a book about Pontius Pilate, nor is it a book about what actually happened in the trial of Jesus. Both topics were of great interest to early Christian apologists, their pagan critics and a parade of later thinkers; and it is these rich intellectual traditions that the book exploits to make its case. Who condemned Jesus, and why, and did they have the right to do so? We encounter a patchwork of competing claims: for example, that Pilate refused to condemn Jesus; or that he condemned him, but believed him innocent; or that he condemned him as a criminal. The Christian accommodation of the tradition that Pilate was guilty in one sense, but innocent in another, is the one that informs the main thrust of the book s argument. Pilate was doing his duty as the representative of a secular power, but did not understand that Jesus was Christ: he was thus, through ignorance, innocent of the charge of deicide, but he nonetheless ordered Jesus  execution. Central to the thesis is the statement Jesus makes before Pilate in the Gospel of John (18:36):  My kingdom is not of this world.  References to Jesus  renunciation of worldly kingdoms can also be found in other parts of the New Testament. The book argues that his refusal to claim this dominion, or to save himself from crucifixion (even though his divine power could have enabled it) had important political consequences in the late antique Mediterranean and medieval Europe. St Augustine s reading of the trial in John emerges as a kind of early manifesto for the division of the sacred realm from what we would call the  secular . For Augustine, Jesus  accusers and Pilate are innocent because they act in ignorance ( they know not what they do , Luke 23:34), but when Pilate sentences Jesus, he does so according to the justice of the saeculum (i.e. the temporal realm, as opposed to the eternal). As the representative of temporal power, Pilate fulfilled his legal responsibility: this is his  innocence . The justice of the saeculum is a form of justice, but imperfect compared to the justice of an all-knowing God.  Truth is not subject to human empire , as the 17th-century legal theorist Samuel Pufendorf has it. From this partition of power and justice, between an imperfect worldly realm based on coercion and an eternal one based on the persuasive power of Christian religious truth, arises the idea of the secular. This twofold partition of prerogatives had a practical aim: it helped the church to maintain its authority while avoiding conflict with political leaders who had military (coercive) power. After the conversion of Constantine to Christianity, church leaders strove to find a way to accommodate Roman imperial power without surrendering to it. Pope Gelasius I (492-96), who, like Augustine, hailed from north Africa, distinguished sacred from secular rule, reassuring the emperor Anastasius that the papacy had no interest in controlling the temporal realm. Yet six centuries later the papacy seemed to renege on this separation and persisted in its claim to worldly authority through medieval times. For critics like the scholar and priest Lorenzo Valla, who exposed as a forgery the Donation of Constantine, a central  ancient  document used to support papal claims to earthly dominion, Jesus  claim in John 18:36 was crucial counter-evidence. So too was it for Dante and Marsilius of Padua, who used Jesus  renunciation to critique the papacy s  perverse desire for government . Rather than arguing for theocracy, these Christian intellectuals used the trial of Jesus to advance the cause of secular authority. By tracing these lines of thought, the book argues that the New Testament contains statements that seem to define a sphere of authority that we would recognise as  secular . Secular rule was certainly not a common feature of ancient states, where politics and religion   what Dusenbury calls a  temple-state    were normally indivisible, and while the word  secular  would not gain its modern sense for more than 1,000 years, the use by early Christians of the concept of the  saeculum  as a legitimate temporal realm separate from the eternal kingdom of God would seem to mark something revolutionary. The powerful image of Jesus renouncing any claim to rule in  this world  helps to explain why some writers that we would normally associate with the secular, such as Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, emerge as inordinately interested in the Pilate trial. These deliberations might seem very far from our own experiences of secularity. Like democracy, we tend to take it for granted as a natural state of affairs. The paradox, according to this book, is that the secular is in large part the offspring of theological argument and, without Jesus  confession before Pontius Pilate, we cannot know how our notions of secularity and tolerance might have developed.

        "title": "Disputing Disaster  by Perry Anderson review",
        "content": "Disputing Disaster is a book about the First World War s origins and causes, not   as its title suggests   the war itself. It discusses six historians who have written on a century-old debate that has swung from an acceptance of German war guilt (as stated in the Paris Peace Agreement in 1919) to sharing responsibility among all the players. Today the scholarly needle, as in the early 1930s, points more to the latter conclusion than the former. Perry Anderson s own position prioritises the systemic origins over the proximate and contingent causes of the July 1914 crisis. He aligns the war s outbreak with the collapse of the Concert of Europe   confirmed by Austria-Hungary s decision to abandon a system which had served it well since 1815   and the emergence of  new  imperialism after 1885. Austria-Hungary was not party to this late flowering of empire and its use of war overseas, neither was Germany, but the Entente powers of Britain, France, Russia, and, ultimately, Italy were, with consequences which from 1909 were visited on Europe via the Balkans. Perversely, the historian of Anderson s six who best encapsulates this argument is not known primarily for his work on the Great War. In his magisterial book on European international relations between 1763 and 1848 Paul Schroeder identified the moment in 1815 when the great powers (and Schroeder argued lesser ones too, though Anderson disagrees), fearing that war might trigger revolution, prioritised peace and so created an international order. Anderson s sextet is so diverse, and his treatment of each historian so different, that it is hard to find consistency between them. The repeated refrains   that the July crisis is itself an insufficient explanation for the war, that the long-term origins matter as much as the causes   have been the stuff of debate since the 1920s when German historians responded to the war guilt charge by releasing documents that appeared to situate the beginning of the story with Germany s unification in 1871. To cover this opening period, Anderson begins with Pierre Renouvin, a historian who, as well as being himself a mutil  de guerre, occupied the high ground in French scholarship on the war until his death in 1974. The chapter puts Renouvin in context, by incorporating not just his French contemporaries but also the Americans Sidney Fay and Bernadotte Schmitt who, in 1928 and 1930, wrote the first major works addressing the war s causes in comparative terms. Fay argued that the system had failed and that responsibility was therefore shared. Renouvin disagreed: Germany was guilty because of its decisions in 1914. Anderson s discussion of this historiographical phase is rewarding but it will be hard going for the lay reader: it takes unfamiliar names for granted and gives no account of the war s outbreak. That does not come until the chapter on Christopher Clark s The Sleepwalkers. Luigi Albertini, the author of the three-volume standard work on July 1914, follows Renouvin. Anderson provides a full account of the failure of Italian liberalism before and after the war to explain Albertini s role, as the editor of the Corriere della Sera, in supporting the war and Mussolini s rise to power. Bizarrely, he says less about Albertini s book, the product of his enforced retirement after 1925, or its eventual impact after the Second World War. Anderson s concern with the inherent conservatism of both Renouvin and Albertini finds its fullest flowering in his third case study. Fritz Fischer s two books on German aims during and before the war, published in 1961 and 1969, reignited the debate around German war guilt. They did so by discounting the actions of the other powers and by using fresh evidence in ways that were selective. Anderson is inclined to forgive Fischer because in the process he contributed to Germany s wider liberalisation. However, he is less interested in the furore Fischer provoked (and in who supported him) than in Fischer s credentials as a Nazi and the reasons he changed his political views after the Second World War. Keith Wilson, Anderson s fourth subject, never published his doctoral thesis and is best known for a brief book of essays, The Policy of the Entente, which for all their individual excellence lack an overarching argument and focus entirely on Britain. Although Anderson makes the case for Wilson as a scholar with a broader international perspective, the chapter fails to locate Wilson s output sufficiently in the work of others. Finally we come to Clark and Schroeder. Their chapters are the longest, largely because they are the most discursive: that on Clark gives equal treatment to his most recent book, on the 1848 revolutions; that on Schroeder devotes space to his critique of US foreign policy after 9/11 (another moment when a great power ruptured the order on which it relied). They have two other features in common. Both historians took the focus away from Germany to Austria-Hungary and the Balkans. In this they were anticipated by a historian whom Anderson does not mention. Samuel Williamson s first book, on Anglo-French strategic relations between 1904 and 1914, published in 1969, addressed issues directly relevant to the discussion of Keith Wilson, but it was his book on Austria-Hungary and the war s origins which most effectively shifted the focus of the debate away from Fischer s fixation with Germany. The dual monarchy was the first power to decide on war and it did so because the current system no longer guaranteed its security in the Balkans. Williamson s absence from Disputing Disaster is regrettable. Both Clark and Schroeder also sought to make what they wrote relevant to international relations theory. Clark did so in ways which, as Anderson says, were anachronistic. Schroeder s engagement with theory was much more sophisticated and sustained. The irony is that neither has had much impact on international relations theory, which takes the outbreak of the First World War as a case study of war s origins but remains stubbornly wedded to the Fischer thesis. The 1914 debate has become a case study of disciplinary division, not fusion.

        "content": "With biographies of all the big-name poets of the Great War (with the exception of Wilfred Owen) to her name, Jean Moorcroft Wilson has established herself as the foremost authority on a subject that increasingly informs the way Britain s public views the conflict as a whole. Seeing the war through the prism of these writers of pity and protest may be a distorting mirror, but given the increasingly pacific nature of our society, the view of the war poets may come to be posterity s settled verdict on the struggle. With this weighty volume, which covers Graves  early life, his war experiences and the troubled postwar decade that led up to the publication of his autobiography, Goodbye to All That   hastily written as a money-making potboiler, but now probably the best-known account by a frontline officer   Wilson has again chalked up a formidable achievement. Her special gift is to integrate a penetrating critique of the poetry into her narrative of the life that gave birth to it. In Graves  case this is particularly important as he first suppressed, then neglected the poems he wrote in the trenches, feeling that they were not worthy of his later elevated bardic view of his muse. In fact, many of the poems rediscovered by Wilson are not bad at all and she does Graves  reputation a favour by resurrecting them. Born in the London suburb of Wimbledon to an elderly Irish father and a German mother, Graves grew up in an intellectual atmosphere, amid a tribe of siblings. Bullied at his public school, Charterhouse, he reacted by becoming a boxer and fighting back. About to go up to Oxford, the outbreak of war found him at his family s holiday home in Harlech, North Wales. He enlisted immediately in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Wilson   unafraid to criticise her subject   makes it very clear that Graves was an unpopular officer. His slovenly, individualistic ways defied the army s attempt to force him into a conformist mould. Salvation came in the form of his friendship with Siegfried Sassoon, when his fellow poet joined the same regiment. Though they later fell out over the fibs and inaccuracies in Graves  memoirs, the relationship was crucial to both men, not least when Graves defended his friend after Sassoon protested against the war. Desperately wounded on the Somme, Graves ended the war a nervous and physical wreck. His first marriage ended when he fell under the spell of the poet and essayist Laura Riding. By then he had found his true metier: as a poet. Graves  eventful life and colourful personality has attracted several biographers. Wilson pays him the compliment of treating him as a son, brother, lover, soldier and war victim, but above all as one of Britain s greatest modern writers.

        "content": "For most of the past hundred years, horror, sorrow and trauma have been the leading motifs of the First World War. They define how its centenary has been commemorated. On one level, this makes sense. Aside from the occasional inspiring story of self-sacrifice, only fools and knaves find much to celebrate in war and each generation has a duty to warn the next of its evil. Over the last four years, however, it has been easy to forget that this was not a war in which there were no victors. Few in Britain or France during the 1920s and 1930s, whatever their struggles, would ever have wished to exchange places with their counterparts in the states roiled by violence, revolution and worse that succeeded imperial Germany, Austria-Hungary and tsarist Russia. Better not to fight, but if you must fight, then it is better to win. In 1918 the British found themselves on the victorious side of the largest and most complex war to date. How did they get there?",

        "content": "The Seventh Dragoon Guards made one of the last charges of the First World War at 10.30am on 11 November 1918, galloping forward and capturing the bridge at Lessines in the Picardy region of Belgium. Fighting officially ended at 11am on the same day, when the Armistice was signed. On hearing the news, the Fifth Dragoon Guards  official war diary described the celebration as the regiment prepared for a  triumphal march into Germany . While the official diary could easily be written in a celebratory tone, this was not necessarily representative of the feelings that other diaries captured. The war diary of the First West Yorkshire Regiment, for example, wrote that  the news was taken very quietly . Back home, newspapers celebrated and reported that women and children were on the streets flying flags, but news of peace was often met by serving troops with quiet reflection and thanksgiving. As we look back now, over the century since the end of the war, it becomes apparent that reactions to the Armistice have changed to fit in with distinct attitudes towards the war and the years that followed it, which echoed the mood of the nation. Using the personal testimonies, diaries and memoirs of the men who served, we can see the varied reactions of soldiers to news of the Armistice, how they chose to observe the occasion and what happened when they arrived back in Britain and returned to civilian life. Deafening silence Scholars have studied personal testimonies and diaries in order to understand the social aspects of the First World War. Soldiers  responses to the Armistice itself, however, were often muted and sometimes missing from the accounts altogether. Jay Winter and Michael Roper are historians who have remarked on a silence surrounding the war from veterans who returned; servicemen s reactions to the Armistice are no exception. Captain Herman Marsden s memoirs, finally typed up in 1976, contain an interesting discussion of his reasons for not talking about the First World War on his return; he did not want to upset families who had lost loved ones and re-open old wounds by indulging in his memories. He explains:  The fear of causing pain to others was perhaps a reason for my reluctance to recall experiences of World War 1914-1918.  Marsden had been seriously wounded and sent back to England on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Somme and the bloodiest in the British army s history. While many of his colleagues were killed that day, Marsden recovered and was returned to the front lines to fight again before the war was over. In his memoirs he describes his emotions on the day of the Armistice: On the 11th November 1918 there was the Armistice. It was almost unbelievable that there was no longer a world war in progress, and Armistice Day passed by unnoticed, without rejoicing or celebration of any kind. There was not even the slightest sense of relief, but for the survivors there were sad and morbid memories of former colleagues and contemporaries. There was, for me of course, bewilderment and wonder about my survival. Indeed an Armistice to end the World War seemed too great a happening for an ordinary mortal to appreciate fully. Order of Battle on Western Front, 11 A.M Nov 11, 1918. Library of Congress. Public Domain. Although written almost 60 years after the events, Marsden s memoirs reflect perfectly the popular and widespread feeling of the anti-war sentiment of the late 1920s and 1930s. In his memoir, Goodbye To All That, the poet Robert Graves similarly commented: In November came the Armistice. I heard at the same time of the deaths of Frank Jones Bateman, who had gone back again just before the end and Wilfred Owen who often used to send me poems from France. Armistice night hysteria did not touch our camp much, though some of the Canadians stationed there were sent down to Rhyll to celebrate in true overseas style. The news sent me out walking alone above the marshes of Rhuddlen cursing and sobbing and thinking of the dead. Graves was a Captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, who experienced trench warfare. His memoirs were first published in 1929. In many ways, his experiences were similar to Marsden s   both were injured in the Battle of the Somme and recovered from their wounds and returned to the trenches. It is also interesting that Graves  memoir was written around the time of the  peak  in the publishing and consumption of war books and memoirs. Erich Maria Remarque s All Quiet on the Western Front, Ernest Hemingway s A Farewell to Arms, R.C. Sherriff s Journey s End and Richard Aldington s Death of a Hero all emerged in 1929, alongside Goodbye To All That. While the writings of Marsden and Graves are similar, it is important to remember that they were both written a considerable time after the Armistice and both may have had a multitude of reasons for revising what they had felt initially. Did their timely and considered memoirs reflect how men actually felt in November 1918 itself? Goodbye to all that The truth is that it is difficult to know. Not many diaries mention the Armistice. Those written at the time are much more difficult to find and interpret than memoirs written in the late 1920s and after. Many men stopped writing before 11 November 1918; others simply noted that there had been an armistice. The war diary of Chaplain Reverend J.A. Herbert Bell, for example, simply commented:  In the afternoon a wire came through officially that hostilities had ceased at 11am today.  The diary offers no other comment nor any hint of response or emotion. Frustratingly, this is typical of the diaries written during this time. A few did, however, leave clues as to their thoughts and feelings at the outbreak of peace. For many servicemen an end to the war was something that they had been dreaming of for years, but it also brought something uncertain, that was beyond the power of comprehension. The omnipresence of death is a recurring theme in the war diary of Private Thomas Reginald Warner of the West Yorkshire Regiment. Even at the beginning of his war diary, on his first posting to France, Warner was counting the death toll and wondering how long the war would last: Standing apart, down the road that leads north about a mile from the camp is a great graveyard, running right down to the sandy shore. There the little wooden crosses, all alike in form, stand in row upon row, with the sea as a royal blue background. A lovely sight, but a sad one; I wonder how much longer it will be before this sad job is over. Diary entry for 11 November 1918, by Canadian serviceman Louis Llewyllen Lent. Provincial Archives of Alberta. Public Domain. Warner s reflections remained much the same at the end of the war. If anything, the longevity of the conflict only helped to reinforce its seemingly everlasting nature. On 29 June 1918, Warner recorded in his dairy: I wonder how long it will last now? I understand that the Germans have made their last effort and failed. It is rumoured that we shall make an offensive and drive them right back. I wonder when, and if we can. This extract highlights an uncertainty and a weariness about winning the war. While it is not pessimistic, it shows the hearsay and rumour prevalent in the trenches, which may have affected people s experience of the Armistice. For others who served, it is clear that there was a strange, melancholic atmosphere regarding the end of the war. For many soldiers, conflict had become a way of life, a place where they had carved out friendships, tested their resilience and led exciting and worthwhile lives. In complete contrast to the anti-war memoirs of both Marsden and Graves, one soldier, Richard Enden, recalled: There wasn t any real excitement or jubilation at the news [of the Armistice]; naturally we were relieved and I m sure that a weight was lifted from our shoulders, but that was all. The war that everyone hoped would end had ended, but so too had a way of life. Writing of the monumentality of the moment in history, Enden also noted:  It seems funny now to think of the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, in fact many men did not know what the day was. Most were concerned to live only day by day.  Mixed feelings Even away from the front lines, experiences of Armistice Day were not always jubilant. Held in his prison barracks, Cecil Slack remembered the moment of the announcement: As soon as the Armistice was declared, we ceased to answer the bugle call for parade in the barrack square. This caused considerable stamping of feet and angry remarks from our captors   We indicated that as the war was over we should no longer be treated as prisoners. For Slack, the signing of the Armistice quickly and materially changed his circumstances; despite being a prisoner of war, he was also a victor who knew that his imprisonment was now only temporary. A German soldier learns of the Armistice at a POW camp in England, November 1918. Library of Congress. Public Domain. The letters of Arthur George Wilson tell a different story. On his last day of leave on 11 November 1918, Arthur was heading from his home city of York to London to return to his battalion the following day: All London streets are packed. Flags [are] out everywhere. We walked down The Mall to join crowds outside Buckingham Palace. I have never seen such excitement. It is not obvious that he shared the crowd s feelings of excitement. Nevertheless, the fact that he joined in suggests that he was at the very least taken along. The knowledge that he had to return to his regiment may well have muted his reaction. The diary of another private from the West Yorkshire Regiment similarly concluded:  When the Colonel announced that the war was over, we all cheered, but our work was not over. Our next duty was to march to Germany.  Although he was one of the lucky ones, the private was not actually demobilised until the second week of March 1919, five months after Armistice Day. For others, demobilisation was an even longer process. In reality, many soldiers knew that the Armistice did not signal much immediate change in their circumstances, even though hostilities had officially ended. Enden, for example, wrote how feelings of insecurity continued, as men remained on the frontlines, surrounded by the reminders of war:  For the next three or four days a phoney war continued with occasional gunfire and now and again the explosion of a delayed mine.  For many, the prospect of a homecoming remained a distant reality and the process of coming home could feel very slow and protracted. It is possible, too, that the difficult conditions awaiting servicemen in Britain after the Armistice can account for some of the anti-war sentiment of the memoirs written in the late 1920s and 1930s. Homecomings The government feared the return of too many unemployed servicemen too quickly. Despite legislation ensuring that ex-servicemen would return to employment, it did not always happen. The economic depression of the interwar years did little to help relieve the problems of unemployment; those who returned home had to compete in a desperately competitive labour market. Marsden offers an insight into the problems faced by such men. His memoirs are both unusual and illuminating for the detail in which he depicts his postwar life, describing his somewhat unsuccessful attempts at finding a job and returning to normality: A satisfactory military career with a Military Cross and a highly prized  mentioned in despatches , quite correctly had not the slightest value as assets in obtaining employment with cash wherewithal on which to live. Indeed, experiences as a temporary officer was, in many respects, a definite handicap. He recalled that  I was a raw recruit, a veritable  rookie  in a fiercely competitive civilian army.  The government tried a range of tactics, including forcing women out of the workplace, to try to rectify the problem of unemployment among ex-servicemen. Demobilised soldiers received papers to document who they were and where they had been, including any suitable training they had received while in the military. Despite such schemes, however, many men struggled and they, like Marsden, often felt that they had missed out on opportunities, only for others to reap the benefits of their absence. For these men, returning home to a land fit for heroes seemed a mockery. Going to war had meant losing out on more valuable civilian experiences. The Armistice merely signalled the return home to another fight. Unfit for work Despite the levels of unemployment, it must be remembered that these were the lucky ones, who were fortunate that employment was still a valid option. For other soldiers, physical and mental disabilities were the lasting legacies from the war. Over its course, around two million British men suffered from disabling wounds, but survived to go back to civilian life. In 1917 a specialist body was set up to look after all the disabled and seriously wounded servicemen: the Ministry of Pensions. One of its tasks was to pay for the treatment and the pensions of men who had received either lifelong or long-term injuries because of their war service. At its peak, in 1920, there were 1,600,000 ex-servicemen receiving pensions or other forms of aid. Support was offered for those deemed to be both totally and  partially  disabled. Pensions were granted on a sliding scale, depending on how disabled the recipient was judged to be. A serviceman who was considered to be fully disabled and completely incapable of work was assessed at 100 per cent. Private John Cook of the East Yorkshire Regiment was discharged from the army on 22 September 1916 as unfit for military service, having received a bullet wound to the skull. Before the war, Cook had been a joiner, but his injuries meant there was little chance that he could return to that. His disability was assessed at 90 per cent and he was granted a pension for life. He received 32 shillings a week for himself and a 14 shillings a week allowance for his wife and child, until his death in 1950. Other soldiers had a harder time proving their ailments and afflictions. Private Joe Bradley was only awarded a pension of five shillings and 10 pence a week for a period of 12 months for trench fever. His disability was assessed at 20 per cent and the money that he received also included an allowance for his wife and child. Like many others, even this was stopped in 1920 as the government tried to ease the financial burden of costly pensions. The great victory parade passes Buckingham Palace, 5 December 1918. Library of Congress. Public Domain. The responsibility of providing proof proved too difficult for some servicemen, who were denied a pension for their disability. Private Sydney Round served as a driver for the Royal Army Engineering Corps. He was in Gallipoli, Egypt and France after 1916. He applied to the Ministry of Pensions for defective eyesight in the right eye after being gassed. His request was rejected as it was considered to be  not aggravated by the war . Round had to look after himself, without any government aid. Other men were disabled through paralysing mental conditions. While many who were diagnosed as  shell-shocked  recovered quickly from their ailments, others  mental afflictions were prolonged and some would never recover. Thomas Olive explained how his wartime experiences manifested themselves once back in civilian life: I used to have little breakdowns now and then and my wife used to be very frightened. It more or less used to happen at night, when I was in bed. My daughter, incidentally, is terribly nervous. My wife says it s all my fault. Well I had shell shock, you see. I got blown up and it affected my whole system. Patients who had not recovered from their trauma could find themselves admitted to local lunatic asylums, as they were then still called. In many instances, the public were scandalised by this and the government set up a scheme in which ex-servicemen were entitled to a small pension and a separate uniform to mark them out from  pauper lunatics . On 1 January 1920, less than three years after the scheme was proposed, there were already 3,739 patients classed as service patients in institutions in England and Wales. Ten years later that number had risen to 4,618. For many of these institutionalised men, the Armistice meant nothing at all. Many lived on for decades, fighting a war that would never end. The valiant dead It seems clear that a serviceman s experiences of the conflict would have influenced his response to the Armistice, depending on whether he was physically or mentally disabled, or was still fighting when peace was announced. It is also important to remember that these reactions were likely to change over time, as attitudes and situations changed, and are subtly different in memoirs, often written years after the conflict, from those in contemporary diaries, written in the heat of battle. As the years passed, Armistice Day became less of an occasion for the living. By the 1920s and 1930s, commemoration had become more about remembering the valiant dead rather than the inconvenient unemployed ex-servicemen, or those who were simply trying to live with their physical and mental injuries with only a meagre pension allowance from the state. A century on, if interest in the First World War begins to wane after the centenary of the Armistice in November 2018, we would be echoing the reactions of 100 years ago, forgetting the plight of those who returned to bear the scar of war until their deaths, whenever that might have been.

        "title": "The Catastrophe at Caporetto",
        "content": "When Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915, it did so fuelled by optimistic visions of territorial conquest. It hoped to seize the largely Italian-speaking regions around Trento and Trieste at the country s north-east border. Nationalist rhetoric held that acquisition of these areas   along with parts of Dalmatia   would complete the process of unification which had taken place in the second half of the 19th century.  Italians want a greater Italy, by conquest not by purchase, not shamefully but through blood and glory , proclaimed the firebrand poet Gabriele D Annunzio. By late 1917, however, fatigue had set in even among the war s supporters. Little apparent progress had been made on any front, casualties were high and the country s economy was suffering badly. Soldiers in the Italian army hoped that the winter of 1917 would offer some respite. It did not. As rumours of an imminent Austro-Hungarian attack circulated, the Italian army sought to reinforce the mountainous north-eastern battle lines around the town of Caporetto (today Kobarid in Slovenia). The town was positioned on the western side of the Isonzo River, which had partially formed the boundary between Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the war. By October 1917, the front lines ran some six or seven miles east of the river, along the heights of mounts Ursig, Nero and Rosso. Caporetto had been selected by the Central Powers as the target for a major offensive because of the weakness of the Italian defence there. When the expected offensive was launched on 24 October, the resulting battle lasted over a month and was a disaster tantamount to a national trauma. We can witness its opening stage through the eyes of Colonel Francesco Pisani who, as acting general of the Foggia Brigade, found himself and his division part of the Italian drive for reinforcement when he was ordered to Caporetto on 23 October 1917. His brigade had been involved in heavy fighting during the summer in the successful conquest of the Bainsizza plateau, and was now in a state of disarray. He hoped Caporetto would be a quiet posting. The units under his command were struggling with large numbers of green, poorly trained soldiers. Pisani led his men towards divisional headquarters at Caporetto overnight through torrential rain and thick fog. They had barely reached the front-line in the early hours of 24 October when an intense enemy bombardment began along the entire north-eastern line. At dawn, though Pisani and his men did not know it, nine Austro-Hungarian and six German divisions under Otto von Below had launched a major offensive. Germany had agreed to support its ally in what was hoped would be a decisive attack on Italy before winter made campaigning impossible. Domestic tensions in Austria-Hungary, caused by the growing desire for autonomy among the empire s many nationalities, made it imperative to seek victory as quickly as possible. The Central Powers  plan was to smash through the Italian lines, advancing through the valleys to isolate and encircle the Italian defenders who were holding the high ground, before pushing on westward towards the rivers and plains of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia. The Foggia Brigade were advancing directly towards the focal point of this attack. As the morning wore on, orders arrived from divisional headquarters redirecting most of the Foggia Brigade s battalions to other nearby destinations where they would reinforce other units struggling under the Central Powers  assault. As the remaining members of the brigade moved towards Caporetto, they began to encounter large numbers of troops retreating down the same narrow mountain road that they were ascending, bringing with them terrible stories about the fighting ahead. After reaching divisional HQ at Caporetto, Pisani and his men were sent to defend the vital Eiffel Bridge. This was one of the few crossings over the fast-flowing Isonzo, which lay in a deep gorge. If the bridge were lost, several Italian divisions on the east bank of the river and on the mountain slopes above it would be entirely cut off. As German units infiltrated the area, encircling the high peaks of Mount Nero and Rosso up ahead, large numbers of Italian troops were seeking to retreat to the relative safety of the west bank and of Caporetto itself. Without the Eiffel Bridge, this evacuation would be impossible. The divisional commander had ordered a general retreat and abandoned control of the town to the Foggia Brigade. Pisani later described his task in his official post-battle debriefing: There was total confusion, the road was almost entirely blocked by a mass of troops, carts, horses, trucks, artillery pieces, mules, and supplies. Officers' cars were unable to make any headway, and it was very hard to execute or even transmit any orders. At this point, the various components of the Brigade became separated, in the chaos, the freezing fog and the rain. We also tried to organise transport for the wounded, many of who had been abandoned in the road. We could hear them groaning through the fog, and it was imperative to move them since their presence was demoralising the defenders of the bridge. By mid-afternoon, Italian army headquarters in Udine, some 25 miles away, were still in complete ignorance of the scale of events. Not until 10pm would Chief of General Staff Luigi Cadorna learn the true dimensions of what the Italian troops were suffering at the country s north-eastern boundary. The situation was a catalogue of woe: indecisive senior commanders, munitions shortages, information blackouts, missing officers and communication breakdowns all worked against a few desperately stretched individuals doing their best to contain the German assault under driving rain and freezing fog. At around 3pm on 24 October, Italian engineers blew up the Eiffel Bridge that the Foggia Brigade was supposed to be defending. At least two Italian divisions were trapped on the eastern side of the river, their retreat cut off. Pisani described the scene: There was no immediate command in the town of Caporetto itself. The order to destroy the bridge must have been given by a senior officer   but when? Perhaps it had been issued in an uncertain and unclear fashion. I concluded that the decision must have been based on the supposition that the enemy was still on the east bank of the Isonzo   but this was not at all the case, and given that the Germans had already crossed the river [further to the south], the destruction of the bridge served no useful purpose. I was ordering the rearrangement of our remaining machine gun posts for a better defence of the position, at about 17.00, and my few staff and I were making our way from one post to another when we suddenly found ourselves confronted by a large group of German soldiers. We had no idea the enemy had approached so close. Concealing themselves in one of the half-ruined buildings along the road, they were able to ambush and encircle us easily. Threatening us with rifles and bayonets, the enemy disarmed us so quickly that there was barely time to even think. This was the end of Pisani s war; captured with his staff, he was despatched to a prisoner of war camp at Karlsruhe in Germany. Leaderless and isolated, the Foggia Brigade stood little chance. Most of the patrols Pisani had sent out in search of information had already been surrounded in the fog. By the end of the day 3,577 of its men had been taken prisoner, while the Central Powers had advanced around 14 miles, seizing bridges, and were established on the west bank of the Isonzo. Around 20,000 Italians were captured that day and by the time the battle ended, a month later, more than 280,000 had been taken by the enemy, almost half of all those captured during the war. * The opening phase of the battle, from 24 October to 3 November, was the most damaging to Italy. The chaotic scenes and mass captures that Pisani witnessed were repeated up and down the peaks and valleys of the north-eastern front. As enormous numbers of troops began to retreat, often without munitions and officers, panic set in and a disorderly mass flight began. By 27 October, the Supreme Command was no longer confident that even the  extreme  line of defence, nearly 45 miles away on the river Tagliamento, would be able to hold. This was where Italy s last prepared defensive positions were located, but Chief of General Staff Cadorna began to contemplate a further withdrawal to the river Piave. The next day, he and his staff abandoned their headquarters at Udine and joined the retreat. The first enemy troops reached Udine at around 3pm; it would soon become the new Austro-Hungarian HQ. The retreating Italians reached the Tagliamento on 31 October. By 3 November the enemy, too, had reached this river, as Italian troops fell back towards the Piave, around 100 miles behind the original front. In the first five days of the battle, huge numbers of Italians were captured but as the retreat continued losses were increasingly caused by desertion. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers fled back into Italy from the positions they had conquered in the first two and a half years of the war. Luigi Albertini, editor of the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera, visited the front on 30 October 1917.  For the most part, the troops did not fight. When sent forward they discarded their weapons and returned unarmed , he reported. Many men claimed that they had been told that the war was over, so it was not only permissible but sensible to head home. In total 300,000 men were  scattered  during the battle. It was impossible to say whether they had voluntarily absconded or simply got lost in the chaos of the retreat. * The speed and extent of the Austro-German offensive had taken the Italian forces by surprise, but it was equally unexpected to the attackers themselves. As a result, they struggled to capitalise on their advance. Bringing up fresh troops and keeping their artillery moving forward proved difficult owing to fleeing civilians, broken bridges and disordered roads, which had also delayed the Italian retreat. This gave the Italians time to regroup. In the second phase of the battle, beginning once the Italians had reached the Tagliamento on 3 November, they began to recover their fighting capacity as the demoralised forces were replaced by more solid and resilient troops drawn from the reserves and from the Alpine front in the north, which had been untouched by the Central Powers  attack. The retreat was controlled and disciplined. Gradually the line stabilised, taking up a new defensive position on the Piave on 9 November. The new front, which was maintained until October 1918, was hundreds of kilometres shorter than the original and thus more easily manned. The terrain, too, was more hospitable, allowing for more effective lines of communication. The third and final phase of the battle started on 12 November and lasted for six days. The Austro-German offensive was renewed, with a final push to break through Italian lines towards Venice. British intelligence reported that  Germany and Austria count on the collapse of Italy during the coming winter . But the push was unsuccessful: the Piave line held, with support from French and British forces, who took over their own sections on 21 November. The battle finally ended on 26 November as the new front stabilised. The front line would remain in this position until the final weeks of the war. By the battle s conclusion more than 5,000 square miles of Italian territory was in enemy hands. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of prisoners and dispersed soldiers, the Italian army also lost 40,000 soldiers who were either killed or wounded during the battle. German and Austro-Hungarian casualties numbered 50,000. Over one million civilian refugees had been forced to flee from the advancing Austro-German troops; many more remained trapped in occupied territory, suffering death, sickness and deprivation under Habsburg military rule. Italy s losses were not limited to land and people. The young Lieutenant Erwin Rommel, fighting south of Caporetto with the W rttemberg Mountain battalion, recollected with pleasure the  chocolate, eggs, preserves, grapes and white bread  which his troops seized and which made their morale  wonderful!  Over 10 million ration sets, and more than six million tins of fish or meat, were among the Italian supplies captured by the advancing Central Powers forces, along with 1,309 tonnes of dried pasta, 645 tonnes of cheese and 253 tonnes of coffee. Of even more interest to Rommel s men, perhaps, was their share of the captured wine (five million litres) and cognac (1,600 litres). The Italians also lost significant stores of clothing and bedding: 966,000 coats and waterproofs, 69,000 hats, 320,000 pairs of boots and 1.5 million pairs of pants and socks along with 295,000 sheets and blankets. Engineers lost more than 17,000 tonnes of essential material, while thousands of trucks and tens of thousands of horses and mules   with their fodder   were abandoned to the enemy. Some 3,000 artillery pieces and a similar number of machine guns were lost, which Italy could ill afford given its shortages of these essential weapons. Several field hospitals with all their beds, iodine and medicines were taken. The loss of significant amounts of coal meant that Italy became dependent on imports from its allies. * The consequences of the defeat were dramatic and a great deal of national soul-searching followed with immediate changes at the highest levels. The prime minister, Paolo Boselli, was replaced by the experienced liberal lawyer Vittorio Orlando. Cadorna was forced out. His high-handed, inflexible leadership was unpopular with civilian politicians and his military abilities had been questioned even before the catastrophic events of Caporetto. Orlando did not want to work with him and nor did the Allies, whose representatives arrived in Italy at the end of October. The allies met at Rapallo, near Genoa, on 5 November, with the battle still raging. They agreed to support Italy and created the Supreme War Council (SWC), a kind of allied general staff. This offered an ideal way to remove Cadorna, who was shifted  upwards  into the SWC, and replaced as Chief of the General Staff by Armando Diaz, a younger, more dynamic and tactful general. Diaz would transform the army s training, formation-level tactics, morale, command structures, leave policies and more. Where Cadorna had stifled initiative and confidence   sacking and demoting commanders at the drop of a hat   Diaz was more open to suggestions and to delegation. Cadorna s dismissal suggested that he was responsible for the defeat, but allocation of blame caused a political row, beginning within 48 hours of the initial attack. Concerns about disaffection and defeatism among the troops had been growing. The authorities feared that  subversive  socialist propaganda was destroying the army s fighting spirit. Cadorna was quick to advance this interpretation. On 28 October he had declared that  the inadequate resistance of units of 2nd Army, cowardly retreating without fighting or ignominiously surrendering to the enemy, has permitted the Austro-German forces to break our left wing on the Julian front . This was damaging to the Italian army s image both nationally and internationally. The Italian ambassador to London recalled that even George V made disparaging comments about the Italian troops  performance. Attributing blame for defeat on the soliders was oddly endorsed by elements of both the right   who saw it as proof of socialist-inspired cowardice and pacifism   and the left, who interpreted it as a  military strike , which demonstrated that the masses had turned against the war. In truth, it is unfair to claim that the frontline units who faced the Austro-German assault on 24 October or the days after failed to fight. The Foggia Brigade s experience of conflicting orders, inadequate supplies and unsuitable defensive positioning was representative of the whole. Many reports suggest that the men fought bravely with determination for as long as they had officers and munitions. Once these two essentials were lost it was hard to keep a positive outlook, as a battalion commander from the 224th infantry regiment recalled: On the night of 23 October my men were in good spirits but by the end of the next day they were less confident. By the end of 25 October, the unit had become mixed with others, the men had not slept for 24 hours and had no more munitions. At this stage they became  morally prisoners  and in a state of depression began to accept the prospect of capture and imprisonment. Under these circumstances large groups of men could be captured by small enemy detachments. The Italian army s defence strategy was also responsible for the defeat. Cadorna had decided to hold the mountainous peaks at all costs while neglecting the valleys below; the Germans simply advanced with speed through these valleys, encircling the defenders on the peaks. Caporetto was a devastating military defeat, but it was one with clearly identifiable strategic, operational and tactical causes. * The battle almost immediately assumed the name of the town where the decisive breakthrough had been made and soon became an emblem of Italian military failure. For decades it was associated with anti-war sentiment, desertion and cowardice. The novelist Carlo Emilio Gadda, who was trapped and captured after the premature destruction of the Eiffel Bridge, described his experience as one of  spiritual horrors . In a sense, the whole country reacted this way. Pisani wrote that  the sacrifice of blood made by the regiments could not hope to dam up the invading tide ; that tide swept away two and a half years worth of gains, made at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. Italy s victory in the First World War came in the battle of Vittorio Veneto, symbolically (if coincidentally) launched on 24 October 1918. Yet the scars left by Caporetto were hard to heal. The shadows of those foggy, chaotic days in the mountains loomed large into the postwar years.

        "title": "Desolation Row: Victorian Britain s Sensational Slums",
        "content": "On 2 November 1895, Rosina Meagher, a young Welsh woman, was attacked by her husband. The assault left her seriously injured. Rosina lived in a notorious lane in Newport known as  Quiet Woman s Row , so-called satirically in the local press as a shorthand for the domestic violence   aimed at women   that was seen as typical of slum areas. Coverage of Quiet Woman s Row in the local press   and its gratuitous focus on violence   was typical of the late-Victorian and Edwardian penchant for  slumland storytelling , where sensational coverage of life in the slums that blighted towns and cities across Britain served as a means of arguing for urban redevelopment   and selling newspapers. Several prominent writers wrote about the urban slum during this period, including Jacob Riis, George Sims, Margaret Harkness, Arthur Morrison and Jack London. Slums   the first recorded use of the word is in 1825   were one symptom of the mass growth in population which occurred in the first half of the 19th century. The shift from agricultural to industrial labour saw people move to urban areas where cheap housing, designed to be fairly short-term, was built on land under short leases to accommodate them. Increasingly, a number of families found themselves crammed in, and unsanitary conditions followed. Fact and fiction frequently merged when it came to depicting slum life. The sordid stories became entertainment for readers who enjoyed the tales at a safe distance.  Slum tourism  developed, where members of polite society went to see for themselves what the slums were like. In the 1890s, the press reported that an unnamed young girl from a wealthy background had been reported missing. Detectives eventually located her in a slum dwelling in East London; the girl had been so  enthused  by Walter Besant s All Sorts and Conditions of Men (1882) that she had decided to visit the area to see how the poor really lived. After telling one resident about her rich parents, she had been abducted, in the hope that her father would pay a ransom for her release. Reports of this girl s misadventure neatly reflect the tropes of  slumland storytelling    a term coined by the historian Alan Mayne to describe the way newspapers in this period increasingly reported criminal incidents in the slum in a manner calculated to appeal to their middle-class, literate, readership. The press created melodramatic tales of slum life, stressing the inherent criminality of slum dwellers who were presented as clearly gendered stereotypes. Men were thugs; women were either unfeminine, displaying a lack of mothering instincts towards their children, or innocents who had married and become victims of domestic violence, left cowering in their slums, or desperately seeking to maintain respectability in the face of abject poverty. Children were either feral, running around in the streets with little parental guidance, or   like the women   innocent beings who, if removed from their environment, might thrive. Women were the focus of this style of storytelling, falling into one of two categories: uncouth criminals or submissive sexual victims. And because women were seen as being akin to children, their loss of virtue, or their criminality, was particularly shocking. Slum stories, of course, were written by outsiders and shaped by preconceptions of slum life. In 1894, the Liverpool Mercury reported the graphic yet intimate details of a local magistrate s experiences of the city s slums. Here, a member of the respectable classes had ventured into the dangerous slums to see the residents  lives and had come back to share his exploits with the rest of his class. It was reported that the main features of slum life were  squalor, drunkenness, improvidence, lawlessness, immorality and crime . Such stories made readers feel as though part of their city was like the Wild West. In 1899, the Belfast-based Northern Whig published a large feature that pushed for wholesale slum clearances. Until this happened, it argued, the slum would remain  the same foul, dangerous quarter of obscenity, filth and degradation  where sin, vice and crime were rife. It depicted destitute female residents existing on weak tea and bread, dying mothers unable to feed their babies and children starving and  vermin-swarmed . It eagerly noted how  drunkenness, harlotry, murder and bestiality  were ever-present in areas where distinctions between sexes were  unknown  due to communal living in doss houses, before including a graphic tale of one wife, the victim of domestic violence, cowering from her  sullen, drunken, murderous brute  of a husband, while he ripped her clothing. This sort of gratuitous writing was not confined to newspaper reports; a genre known as  slum fiction  became popular, including well-known titles such as George Gissing s The Nether World and Arthur Morrison s A Child of the Jago as well as the popular  penny dreadfuls . In the reports  detailing of the beaten wife s flushed face, agonised eyes and torn bodice it particularly resembles the latter. There was a clear sexual element to the violence, as the descriptions of bestiality and harlotry suggest. The account certainly emphasised the brutality of slum life, but it also aimed to titillate its readers. In press reports, individual incidents and criminal cases were seen as symptomatic of slum life. Any case that came before the local courts would be pounced on if the parties involved lived in slum areas. The fact of their residence made their lives immediately newsworthy. Such was the case of Rosina Meagher and Quiet Woman s Row. A notorious dockside street in the Pillgwenlly district of Newport, south Wales, the Row had been the subject of an increasing number of newspaper articles in the years before Rosina s case made the news. These had focused primarily on the female residents  tendency towards crime and disorder, despite the fact that the majority of such cases involved petty offences. These included fights over the use of shared washing-lines, arguments over keeping animals in backyards and the theft of coal from the nearby docks. It is true that the verbal and minor assaults frequently involved women, but this is inevitable given that they tended to spend more time at home than their husbands, who worked at the docks. Domestic spaces were cramped and busy, leading to an understandable loss of temper   but motivation and cause were not of interest to the press. From the mid-1870s onwards, newspapers increasingly focused on the  not so quiet women  of Quiet Woman s Row, referring to the lane as  the locality miscalled Quiet Woman s Row  and  that paradox of female Paradise . When Thomas Meagher was tried for the attempted murder of his wife, the case was covered extensively in Wales. There were expos s of Rosina s poverty-stricken life, where  there was not a particle of furniture in the house . Slum women were usually either  untidy women  and inadequate housekeepers, or innocents corrupted by the slum. Rosina was to be the latter, the bourgeois ideal of womanhood; a pretty, golden-haired girl with an alcoholic, abusive husband, who, despite living in a slum street, kept her house and its exterior tidy, so that it  presents a cleaner aspect than others . Rosina Meagher became a slumland sensation. The Evening Express sent a reporter out to investigate the den of iniquity from which she had emerged: Instead of being the quarters of orderly females, it is quite the reverse, and hardly a police-court is held but what some disorderly case is heard from that quarter   Our reporter, who visited it on Saturday morning, says it is a typical abode of the poorest clan of Irish folk. A group of coarse, dirty women stood, with their bare arms akimbo, discussing  the murder , whilst a dozen of half-dressed children were sitting about the road, apparently playing. It was, the report said, a poverty-stricken street with residents who partook in gossip while their children roamed around, neglected. But there was fear, as well as curiosity, in how the case was reported. As a result of the press coverage, slum tourists converged on the Row to see how the poor of their town lived and to see where a woman was nearly murdered. When a case as horrific as the Meagher attack made the pages of the newspapers, there was a desire by those in Newport to distance themselves from the poor in their area. This area of the town was  not to do with them    it was alien, other, separate from, and outside of,  ordinary  society. * Slum stories appeared against the backdrop of major economic and social change. Newspapers were full of reports of houses being bought and sold for some quite considerable sums; but alongside this were stories about houses in Quiet Woman s Row not selling, of short-term leases that resulted in residents frequently moving on and of landlords failing to maintain their properties. No link was made between the high instances of petty crime in the Row and unemployment, low wages or poor living conditions. Yet there were regularly appeals for something to be done about the Row. In 1850, a report into the sanitation of the town had described it in grim terms: damp and filthy, with only one outside privy to serve 14 houses and an ever-present stench due to the existence of an open rubbish pit. Over the next half century, there continued to be problems getting the landlords of these cheaply built houses to accept responsibility for maintaining them. In 1888, the owner of a two-roomed house   let to a family of seven   was called to the police court for allowing the premises  to be in a filthy and overcrowded condition . Residents themselves demonstrated some agency in 1875, organising a petition that was submitted to the council, calling attention to  the closet accommodation to the houses at west end of Quiet Woman s Row, which is a disgrace and a nuisance to the neighbourhood . The following year, one magistrate  made further allusion to the unsatisfactory condition of Quiet Woman s Row  and noted that 68 residents had to share two privies. The owner was served notice to provide four additional closets, although there is no evidence that they did. In 1887, a press report speculating that the Row would be demolished to make way for a new railway and station serving the dockyard made no reference to the impact it would have on residents, but enthused, instead, on the benefit of such plans to the whole borough of Newport. The residents of the Row were living in conditions regarded as among the worst in the area, where the struggle to even get the most basic of amenities took years and where they were seen by the rest of Newport as, essentially, a foreign presence. The focus on criminality in the Row was not entirely unfounded. Some residents did commit offences, which was also the case in many other slum areas. A few of the women in the Row were repeat offenders, but men also appeared in court, often for more serious offences, including severe physical assaults and attempted murders. Many petty offences were understandable given the economic and spatial pressures on residents of both genders; there were fights over shared spaces, an impatience with sharing tiny, unhygienic houses with multiple other occupants, including grown-up children, and financial worries that saw many steal small coal and others unable to pay the required maintenance when their children ended up in the local reformatories. In 1893, a resident called Thomas Flynn told the court he could not pay a fine  because for some time past work had been very dead . But overwhelmingly press coverage focused on the women of the Row. Virtue, once subjected to the realities of the slum, was soon lost. Quiet Woman s Row became shorthand for crime, disorder and filth. It was soon at the forefront of the local press  attempts to see slums swept aside in the name of progress. Newsprint influenced both public opinion and local government policy. By focusing on the crimes rather than their underlying causes and by making the Row a no man s land where fearless investigative reporters volunteered to visit and report on the inhabitants as though they were a foreign tribe, press coverage made the Row appear not a part of Newport   and if it wasn t part of Newport, it shouldn t be there. Soon it wasn t   it was demolished in 1899, and the last reference to it in the press, in 1910, made clear that it was a piece of history deservedly consigned to the past. The sensationalism of slum reporting had been replaced by a mere footnote in an article about  curious  place names of the past.

        "content": "When Penguin published The Buildings of England: London Except the Cities of London and Westminster, Pevsner's text referred to the Rowton Houses in Camden Town as 'still belonging to the slums'. This brought a threat of action against the publisher for defamation. Rowton Houses are now largely forgotten, but figure in the Homes of the Homeless exhibition at the Geffrye Museum. Starting with life on the streets, the exhibition reveals that the homeless had to sleep during the day because the police moved them on at night. Homelessness became an acute problem in London as the drift from the country to the towns accelerated in the early 19th century. Itinerant workers, 'Navigators' or 'navvies', arrived in vast numbers to dig the canal network and to build the railway lines. Where were they to be housed? What would they eat? If a labourer lost his job, he and his family might be made homeless. The rapid growth of slums, often in close proximity to wealthy areas, alarmed those of the middling class and motivated religious zealots. Faster, cheaper methods of graphic reproduction fed the consternation of the better-off. Magazines such as the Graphic, the Illustrated London News and the Sketch shocked their readers with pictures of poverty. Religious campaigners fuelled controversy with pamphlets detailing the horrors of the slums. For the most part the curators ignore missionary campaigns, instead concentrating on housing provision. This varied from the municipal workhouse to common lodging houses. Visitors to the Geffrye can see what 'picking oakum' actually means; the bold may try a replica 'coffin bed' for size. Prince Albert, in his quest to improve housing for the poor, took up the architect Henry Roberts in the 1840s. Roberts was the honorary architect to the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes. Large watercolours and a model of his flats for the society open the exhibition. Built near the British Museum in 1849, they still stand today. They illustrate a problem for the reformers: how to design large buildings, for multiple occupation by separate families, without them being liable to Window Tax? A humble fourth-rate family house with six windows or fewer was exempt, a large block for a hundred people would be taxed at a shilling per window. Roberts was commissioned to design model cottages for poor families, which were shown at the Great Exhibition in 1851, the year that the Window Tax was repealed, permitting the building of immense blocks. Paintings in the exhibition tend to be sentimental rather than controversial, our empathy with photographs is more immediate. Jack London concealed a small camera about him when he lived rough in London. He used his surreptitious photographs to illustrate his People of the Abyss (1903). Photographs, whether taken secretly, or by those in positions of power, allow for no self-conscious posing: a queue of women awaiting free tea, eye the photographer unconcernedly. Almost life-size, their steady gaze is disconcerting. Their ragged clothes not a style statement, but the only ones that they possessed. Charles Dickens had known the horror of the workhouse and loathed the blacking factory to which he was sent to work. A fragment of a blacking bottle is shown, as is a bowl such as might have been used by Oliver Twist. An unexpected exhibit is a stuffed and mounted stag's head from a Rowton House. The caption claims that they were considered as luxurious as gentlemen's clubs in the West End. Spartan as the establishments of Pall Mall and St James's may be, they are not as grim as Rowton lodgings. Pevsner was not dragged into court: the management of the Rowton Houses were content with an apology and an erratum slip. Sportingly, they sent Pevsner an invitation to spend a night to see for himself. His reaction is not recorded, but one suspects he did not see the joke. Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London is at the Geffrye Museum until July 12th, 2015. David Brady is a historian of art, architecture and design.",

        "title": "Welcome to Dottyville",
        "content": "During the First World War, specialist hospitals were established, intended to  cure  patients of shell shock and send them back to the front. One curative approach was ergotherapy, or  cure by functioning , a treatment we would today identify as occupational therapy, which encouraged patients to remain active and take part in work and recreational activities. This emphasis on activity as cure is rooted in the changes to mental health care which began with the work of  mad-doctor  William Battie in the 1700s. Care for  the insane  shifted away from the more oppressive methods employed in early asylums, towards humane care and moral discipline. One of the key changes   alongside an emphasis on regimen, work and recreation   was the prioritisation of patients  creative expression. In the long 19th century, patients at sanatoria were encouraged to paint, knit and write poetry and prose as part of their care. As a result of this, a number of establishments, from 1837 until the mid-20th century, produced patient-led hospital magazines. Craiglockhart War Hospital, a military psychiatric hospital in Edinburgh, introduced a hospital magazine in 1917, for which some soldiers wrote as part of their therapeutic treatment. It was called The Hydra, in reference to the hospital s prewar role as a centre for hydrotherapy, where the Victorians had come for water treatments. It also evoked the many-headed monster of Greek mythology, reinforced by its cover image of the terrible creature   a reference writer John Garth says was  wry humour by officers suffering from war trauma . Edited for a time by Wilfred Owen and including poems by fellow writer Siegfried Sassoon, who referred to the hospital as  Dottyville , The Hydra served as a platform for patients to express their creativity. Sassoon s poem  Dreamers  was first published in its pages, and Owen s poems  Dulce et Decorum est  and  Anthem for Doomed Youth  were written during his time at the hospital. The Hydra was, and still is, a valuable document for understanding the inner lives of those suffering from shell shock and seeking psychological amelioration through the arts. It also enabled patients to showcase their creative interpretations of the war to a wider audience. The team behind the magazine was aware of this and delighted in it: one editorial proclaimed,  The Hydra has already acquired a footing in the world outside, and when we found a copy reposing bashfully in a hairdresser s shop we were overcome with joy.  Craiglockhart is thought to be a key hospital in revolutionising mental health care after the First World War and the double outcome of The Hydra   in its advocating of patient care and its prioritising of patients  voices   played an important role in this. Through The Hydra, patients could unite their voices with others advocating change. The historian Tracey Loughran has suggested that shell shock provided a powerful impetus for reform of the mental health care system, demonstrating a need for effective and immediate treatment for those suffering from what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder. Although there was a strong movement for reform, the Mental Treatment Act, which made provision for voluntary treatment at outpatient clinics, was not passed until 1930. Likewise, despite this prominent challenge to the government s inadequate mental health care facilities, it appears that attitudes within the military did not change. Institutional improvements were very slow, which meant that individual doctors had to carry the lessons learned from helping shell-shocked patients into their postwar careers. Mental health was not a priority for the government, nor did military authorities maintain a psychiatric service, despite the fact that 80,000 officers and ordinary soldiers had suffered a debilitating mental disability by the end of the war. Today s system for providing mental health care is much more robust and it is recognised that creativity can play a key role in psychological wellbeing. This, however, is jeopardised by continuous cuts to arts funding and to the National Health Service. April 28th marks 100 years since the first publication of The Hydra and it is worth using this centenary to think about the battles which have been fought over the last century to advance understanding of, and provision for, mental health care.

        "content": "The First World War centenary gave us a better understanding of the vast contribution made by the Indian Army to that conflict. The focus, though, was on the soldiers and little was made of the thousands of Indians who travelled to France and Mesopotamia as  followers  and labourers   mule drivers, sweepers, stretcher-bearers, porters and construction workers. Few could write so their story can seem impossible to recover. This gap has now been filled by Radhika Singha, a professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, who has devoted nearly a decade to researching the Indian Labour Corps (ILC). Her thoughtful, meticulous history is sobering in what it reveals. Of the 1.4 million Indians recruited up to the end of 1919, 563,369 were non-combatants. Many were from the frontier hill states of Assam, Bihar and Orissa. There were strong inducements to join up: those who volunteered became exempt for life from an onerous house tax and any further labour obligations. For some, the prospect of returning to India with funds to marry may have been attractive. For others there may have been a sense of adventure. On arrival in Mesopotamia, canals needed to be deepened and extended, roads built and railway lines laid down, all in blistering heat. Singha has mined regional archives, official reports, unit diaries and private accounts to piece together stories of impossibly long hours, punishing journeys on foot to remote worksites and lack of proper equipment and clothing. Lieutenant Maynard Knight, a tea planter commanding a detachment of the 1st Madras Labour Corps, reported that a great number of his men, their hands cut and bruised through work on the Khanikin railway, had  no boots at all, and only one blanket a piece . Desertion was at first punished by flogging, but seeing potential issues, the military instead set up  disciplinary camps  surrounded by barbed wire. There was at one point an urgent need for sanitation workers and the authorities turned to Indian jails for this dangerously unhygienic work. Prisoners were recruited with  suspicious swiftness . Travelling by train to Bombay, the newly enlisted men of the 5th United Provinces Jail Porter Corps pulled the communication cord no fewer than seven times and by the end of the journey seven of them were missing. Deployed in France from 1917 onwards, the ILC found the long sea route to Marseilles bewildering and traumatic. Overcrowding led to dysentery and, to the recruits  great distress, some of their companions had to be buried at sea. The labourers were put to work clearing the battlefields of the Western Front. Lord Ampthill, former Governor of Madras, wondered how men  from the hills and jungles, who have barely emerged from barbarism  would shape up as labour. Not long after, Ampthill was admitting to a colleague the dangers these men faced:  Mills bombs lurk in the grass and explode at a touch.  Two Jesuit priests travelled with the ILC and observed them clearing the Somme battlefields: Every five yards we come across bones still wrapped up in their putties, arms and legs blown off by shell-fire.

        "content": "It is difficult to forget a work of history that begins with a discussion of the author s dental history and ends with a reflection on the beret as symbol of the Vichy regime in France. Perhaps that is why Richard Cobb s French and Germans, Germans and French has stuck with me ever since I first read it as an undergraduate student. Out of print since it was first published in 1983, this unique study of the lived experience of occupation in France during two World Wars has been reissued as a handsome paperback in Penguin s  Modern Classics  series. French and Germans is an idiosyncratic book, but Richard Cobb was an idiosyncratic historian. Primarily known as a specialist of the French Revolution, he began his research career in Paris in the late 1930s before being called up in 1941. Having spent several years at the end of the war as an interpreter based in France, Belgium and Germany, Cobb resumed his decidedly unconventional career in 1946. Appointed to a lectureship at Aberystwyth in 1955, he proudly advertised his second, French, identity, publishing primarily in French until the late 1960s. For Cobb, a true understanding of history could not be achieved through archival research alone. Rather, in the historian David Gilmour s words, it had to be  walked, observed, smelt, drunk  in Paris and elsewhere. Cobb s study of France under occupation was published towards the end of his academic career, appearing in the same year as the first volume of his memoirs, Still Life: Sketches from a Tunbridge Wells Childhood. The book began life as a series of lectures on occupied France delivered in Britain and America, each one fuelled by a pint of Guinness, which Cobb sipped throughout as he warmed to his theme. French and Germans is not the product of the kind of marathon archival research that underpins much of Cobb s other work   nor does it pretend to be. Cobb described the book as  a personal interpretation , a provocation to further research rather than the last word on the subject. The book is divided into two parts: a single chapter on occupants and occup s in the department of the Nord during the First World War and four more substantial chapters on occupation and collaboration between 1940 and 1944. Cobb s evocative, if sometimes meandering, reflections draw on a range of material, including newspapers, memoirs, novels and personal recollections, as well as the historian s own imagination. Cobb was not afraid to acknowledge the part played by his own experience of France at war in shaping his historical reflections. As he saw it, it was impossible  to divorce history from experience . Cobb s book was a response to a significant shift in historical and cultural understandings of the Occupation and the Vichy regime, which began in the late 1960s. The French filmmaker Marcel Ophuls  seminal 1969 documentary The Sorrow and the Pity revealed the complexity of collaboration and resistance in the town of Clermont-Ferrand. The film inaugurated what the French historian Henry Rousso would later describe as the  broken mirror , as the old certainties of de Gaulle s  eternal France  were challenged. Instead of a nation united in resistance to the occupier and the illegitimate Vichy government, a rather different picture of wartime France began to emerge. As Cobb notes in the bibliographical essay at the end of French and Germans, work by Anglophone scholars was central to this shift. Among them were Robert Paxton, whose 1972 book Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order sent shockwaves through France and demonstrated the scale of willing collaboration between Vichy and the Nazis; and Rod Kedward, whose 1978 work Resistance in Vichy France marked a turning point in the historiography of the French Resistance. What marks French and Germans as a classic work of history, above all, is its evocation of occupation on a human scale. Cobb was always a historian of individuals, insisting that the past could only be properly understood  in terms of human relationships . This approach is at the heart of French and Germans, and gives the book warmth and intimacy. Cobb is at his best when conveying the complex relationships and interactions between the occupiers and occupied through glimpses (sometimes imagined) of their shared existence. Cobb imagines a working-class French woman in a relationship with a German soldier, waking in the night in the spring of 1918, noticing  his leather belt (with Gott Mit Uns clasp) , and hearing  the continuous rumble  in the distance. Cobb is sensitive in his handling of women and their children born  to an unknown father . For Cobb, therefore, there can be no simplistic oppositions in understanding the experience of occupation in 20th-century France. As he shows, for most Frenchmen and women the overwhelming response to occupation was what Henry Rousso would later characterise as attentisme: wait and see. Did waiting and seeing equate to collaboration with the occupying Nazis? Cobb reminds us that  collaboration is an endlessly elastic concept .  Was anyone who worked, directly or indirectly, for the Germans a collaborator? , he asks. What of the Paris M tro driver, continuing to do his job even as he knew that his train carried  German, as well as French, passengers, wedged fraternally like   sardines?  Occupation was lived not in black and white, but shades of grey. There has been much historiographical water under the bridge since French and Germans first appeared in 1983. New evidence and innovative approaches by successive generations of historians have ensured the study of France under occupation remains vital, exciting and often provocative. There is still a place, however, for Cobb s distinctive voice. At the start of the book, he states that his main concern is that  the present study   should make enjoyable reading . And it certainly does   but, more than that, French and Germans remains a reflective and thought-provoking work that challenges readers to leave aside any assumptions that  it can t happen here . The final word goes to Cobb:  Let us not be deceived into believing   that the history of Vichy   has nothing to teach us.

        "content": "With biographies of all the big-name poets of the Great War (with the exception of Wilfred Owen) to her name, Jean Moorcroft Wilson has established herself as the foremost authority on a subject that increasingly informs the way Britain s public views the conflict as a whole. Seeing the war through the prism of these writers of pity and protest may be a distorting mirror, but given the increasingly pacific nature of our society, the view of the war poets may come to be posterity s settled verdict on the struggle. With this weighty volume, which covers Graves  early life, his war experiences and the troubled postwar decade that led up to the publication of his autobiography, Goodbye to All That   hastily written as a money-making potboiler, but now probably the best-known account by a frontline officer   Wilson has again chalked up a formidable achievement. Her special gift is to integrate a penetrating critique of the poetry into her narrative of the life that gave birth to it. In Graves  case this is particularly important as he first suppressed, then neglected the poems he wrote in the trenches, feeling that they were not worthy of his later elevated bardic view of his muse. In fact, many of the poems rediscovered by Wilson are not bad at all and she does Graves  reputation a favour by resurrecting them. Born in the London suburb of Wimbledon to an elderly Irish father and a German mother, Graves grew up in an intellectual atmosphere, amid a tribe of siblings. Bullied at his public school, Charterhouse, he reacted by becoming a boxer and fighting back. About to go up to Oxford, the outbreak of war found him at his family s holiday home in Harlech, North Wales. He enlisted immediately in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Wilson   unafraid to criticise her subject   makes it very clear that Graves was an unpopular officer. His slovenly, individualistic ways defied the army s attempt to force him into a conformist mould. Salvation came in the form of his friendship with Siegfried Sassoon, when his fellow poet joined the same regiment. Though they later fell out over the fibs and inaccuracies in Graves  memoirs, the relationship was crucial to both men, not least when Graves defended his friend after Sassoon protested against the war. Desperately wounded on the Somme, Graves ended the war a nervous and physical wreck. His first marriage ended when he fell under the spell of the poet and essayist Laura Riding. By then he had found his true metier: as a poet. Graves  eventful life and colourful personality has attracted several biographers. Wilson pays him the compliment of treating him as a son, brother, lover, soldier and war victim, but above all as one of Britain s greatest modern writers.

On one level, this makes sense. Aside from the occasional inspiring story of self-sacrifice, only fools and knaves find much to celebrate in war and each generation has a duty to warn the next of its evil. Over the last four years, however, it has been easy to forget that this was not a war in which there were no victors. Few in Britain or France during the 1920s and 1930s, whatever their struggles, would ever have wished to exchange places with their counterparts in the states roiled by violence, revolution and worse that succeeded imperial Germany, Austria-Hungary and tsarist Russia. Better not to fight, but if you must fight, then it is better to win. In 1918 the British found themselves on the victorious side of the largest and most complex war to date.

        "content": "More than three years after the outbreak of the First World War, on February 3rd, 1917, the recently appointed Food Controller, Lord Devonport, announced the first government-sponsored system of food control. Unlike Germany, which had introduced rationing early in the conflict, there was a reluctance to do so in Britain, as it went against the prevailing Liberal principles of free trade. Instead, responsibility for food was delegated to the Board of Trade, which saw the answer to the food problem in the maintenance of a steady supply of imports rather than restrictions. Newspapers and periodicals carried notices appealing to the patriotism of British consumers. The Daily Mail and several other publications printed the same article on different dates in August 1914 on war economy, proclaiming that:  It has become a patriotic duty as well as a wise precaution to reduce expenditure all round, to jettison luxury in money, food, fuel and the rest.  Although the term war ration was used from early on, there was no official line on what this might mean. Instead, there was an expectation that patriotism would guide consumers only to buy what they needed and not as much as they could afford. Furthermore, there was little action taken against rising prices   an increase of 65 per cent between summer 1914 and summer 1916   and there were no official measures ensuring equitable distribution of food. It was argued that problems in the food supply were not caused by disruptions to imports but that people were being unpatriotic and wasteful in their consumption. In consequence, the Robertson Committee, led by John M. Robertson, Liberal MP for Tyneside and, until 1915, parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade, was set up to examine the situation. It concluded that, contrary to the arguments of the Board of Trade, the war was responsible for shortages, both in terms of declining imports and the increased requirements of the army. Following this report, the government relented and in October 1916 a Food Department was established within the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. As late as November 1916, however, the Asquith coalition was rejecting the need for a Food Controller. want orders, not requests. It might be a finer thing if each individual did her bit in the economy line without compulsion, but it s human nature that we don t.  This growing discontent with the availability of food undoubtedly contributed to the collapse of Asquith s government and one of the first items on the agenda of the new government under David Lloyd George was the appointment of Hudson Kearley Ewbanke, Lord Devonport,as Food Controller at the new Ministry of Food. There had been a poor harvest worldwide in 1916, reducing the amount of grain available for both human and animal consumption; the reduced levels of food for animals in turn caused a decline in the levels of meat and dairy products. Coupled with an increasing German U-Boat campaign, which caused difficulties for the importing of food, the supply situation in Britain was declining rapidly. An article in the popular women s periodical Home Chat in December 1916 encapsulated the frustrations of consumers. Entitled  Why Don t They Make Us Do It? , the author, Hilda M. Love, argued:  We want orders, not requests. It might be a finer thing if each individual did her bit in the economy line without compulsion, but it s human nature that we don t.  This growing discontent with the availability of food undoubtedly contributed to the collapse of Asquith s government and one of the first items on the agenda of the new government under David Lloyd George was the appointment of Hudson Kearley Ewbanke, Lord Devonport, as Food Controller at the new Ministry of Food. One of the first actions by Lord Devonport was to implement a system of voluntary rationing with officially prescribed limits. Hilda M. Love s follow up article in Home Chat,  Coming out Strong , published in the week before the announcement, celebrated this development, saying:  We women have asked for restrictions, have said we would welcome anything to aid a speedy victory, and we ve now got as good as we asked for.  In his announcement of February 3rd, 1915, which was carried in full in The Times and summarised in other national newspapers, Devonport once again appealed to the patriotism of consumers: Economy is not only a patriotic duty, but a necessity. Extravagance is obviously unpatriotic. The power to purchase does not constitute the right, and nobody should obtain more than is necessary. Frugality practised at home will ensure a sufficient supply for all, despite any effort of the enemy. There were now official recommendations for consumption. Each person was asked to limit their purchase of three staple foods to prescribed amounts: 2 lb of meat,  lb of sugar and 4lb of bread, per head per week. These were only suggested amounts, however. Captain Bathurst, Devonport s parliamentary secretary, pointed out that the ration was only  intended to be an average and it is left to the general public to observe the average in the spirit of the appeal . George V and the royal family announced they would be adhering to these restrictions and a royal proclamation was issued. Householders were encouraged to sign this King s Pledge and in return they were promised a metal  ration badge , which could be worn on the lapel as a public display of their patriotism. The pledge scheme proved so popular that there were not enough badges and a purple ribbon pin was issued instead. No doubt those who signed up to the pledge had some intention of adhering to it but ultimately Devonport s voluntary rationing programme did little but put off the introduction of compulsory rationing for another year. It was only with reluctance that Devonport proposed an outline scheme for rationing but by that stage the public and the government had lost confidence in his ability to manage the situation and he resigned in May 1917. His successor, Lord Rhonnda, persisted with voluntary rationing until February 1918, when bread, butter, meat and sugar consumption were controlled. Appealing to patriotism could only go so far   as  A Little Bird  joked in the magazine Woman s Life:  Have you heard the best method for testing one s patriotism? It is this: get yourself weighed: if you are steadily losing, you can indeed claim to be a true patriot.

        "title": "Ireland: Easter Rising or Great War?",
        "content": "In May 1916 the young Dubliner Se n Heuston was sentenced to death for his participation in the Irish Easter Rising of that year. The night before his execution he wrote to his sister and touched upon how he and his colleagues might be judged: Let there be no talk of foolish enterprise. I have no vain regrets. Think of the thousands of Irishmen who fell fighting under another flag at the Dardanelles. Thousands of Heuston s contemporaries were killed or wounded when the 10th (Irish) Division landed at Gallipoli in 1915; it is a little reminder that Heuston and the others who fought in the Easter Rising lived in a world shaped by the Great War, which conditioned their own actions. The centenary of the outbreak of the First World War generated great public interest in Ireland. The Irish involvement in the Gallipoli campaign is being marked in a variety of ways. Last November the Irish government announced its plans for the impending centenary of the Easter Rising of 1916. The emphasis on 1916 arises from the fact that it was the catalyst for the independence movement   Sinn F in and the IRA   that led to the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922. With the foundation of the Free State a substantial portion of the United Kingdom broke away from the whole in an unprecedented manner; it is of obvious relevance in the light of last year s Scottish referendum. There is still a tendency to view the Easter Rising and the First World War as distinct events, even if someone like Heuston did not. This is understandable on one level: the Irish involvement in the First World War (210,000 volunteers and 35,000 deaths) overwhelmingly took place in the British armed forces: an unlikely bedfellow for a tradition of resistance to British rule. But the First World War was fundamental to the growth and development of the Irish independence movement, especially in relation to the Easter Rising. The separatist republicans who planned and executed the rising did so within the context of a war that gave them both an opportunity and a prospective ally: Germany. The British suppressed it in the manner in which they did precisely because they were at war and feared the potential for German involvement in such an insurrection. Some Irish responses to 1916 were surprisingly hostile, especially on the part of the families of serving troops. Many Irish soldiers were involved in suppressing the rebellion and the Easter Rising cannot be understood outside the context of the British war effort. Among the British and Irish fatalities of the Great War are those troops who were killed when the Great War came to Dublin for a week in April 1916. Many of them are still buried there. The approach to a number of centenaries up to 2022 has seen a greater recognition on the part of the Irish government of the experiences of Irishmen who fought in the First World War, along with a increased, albeit cautious, British official engagement with the reality of the Irish independence movement. The speech by Britain s Minister for International Security Strategy, Andrew Murrison, in Cork on January 24th, 2014, was a natural follow-on from the symbolism of the state visit to Ireland of the Queen in 2011. Yet while one can be respectful of differing viewpoints, it is also right to caution against the creation of a contrived historical consensus about events that might not be compatible in ideological terms. This was pointed out by the Irish government s Expert Advisory group on commemorations: the Irish state can hardly be neutral about its origins in 1916. Yet there are lives that straddled a range of experiences to make one think how the Irish independence movement and the First World War are intertwined. Take, for instance, Michael McCabe, who fought in the Easter Rising as a member of the Irish Volunteers; served in the British army from 1917 to 1922; fought against the Irish Free State as a member of the IRA in the Irish Civil War; yet, when applying for his IRA pension in 1938, did so as a member of the 2nd Battalion, Gold Coast Regiment, Royal West African Frontier Force. Does his life point to a  shared  history, or to distinct histories, inextricably linked? Ireland was not the only small European country to gain independence from a larger one in the era of the First World War; the difference is that it was a rare instance of a country gaining independence from a victorious power. The creation of the Irish Free State is the single most fundamental change to the UK since it was created. That alone makes the events that led to it worth looking at anew from a British perspective.

        "title": "Pacifism and Feminism in the Great War",
        "content": "More than 1,100 women from warring and neutral states gathered at The Hague in April 1915 for a special set of peace negotiations. They were not diplomats representing states, and they were not present to press national demands. Most were unable even to vote in parliamentary elections in their own countries. They were feminists and pacifists, and it was their commitment to these twin ideals that drew them together as conflict raged across Europe. Their vision of a peace founded on gender equality, social justice and human rights did not bring the war to a close. Nor was it embraced by the male powerbrokers meeting in Paris in 1919 to conclude peace terms. Yet the 1915 International Congress of Women is important because it reminds us that the First World War not only mobilised armies but nurtured alternative forms of politics, not least the politics of international cooperation and peace. Who were the women at The Hague? They were mainly middle-class, well-travelled and experienced feminist activists, many with professional backgrounds and all advocates of women s suffrage. They included the British lawyer Chrystal Macmillan, Aletta Jacobs, the pioneering Dutch physician, the Hungarian feminist Rosika Schwimmer and the trade unionist Lida Gustava Heymann of Germany. The US peace campaigner Jane Addams agreed to preside as chair of the Congress. Many travelled to the Netherlands at personal cost, encountering hostility from the patriotic publics of the belligerent nations. In Britain, anti-war campaigners were placed under official surveillance. As a result, only 20 of the 180-strong British delegation were issued with passports, and even they found it impossible to cross the North Sea due to military operations. The three British women who reached The Hague had either travelled some weeks earlier or went by a different route. Taking a stand against the war was, furthermore, a difficult experience emotionally for many of the delegates. They found themselves in conflict with suffragist comrades who chose a different course, seeing the war as an opportunity to prove themselves loyal citizens and hence convince their respective governments to grant women the vote. After four days of discussions and debates, the Congress agreed a set of 20 resolutions encompassing practical proposals for immediate negotiations to end the war, as well as fundamental principles for a permanent peace. Among the latter were the right of self-determination for all peoples; the creation of an international authority to arbitrate disputes and advance constructive cooperation between nations; and an end to  secret diplomacy  conducted behind closed doors and without democratic accountability. International Congress of Women in session, 1915. Rosika Schwinner fourth from the left, Jane Addams sixth, Aletta Jacobs eighth, and Chrystal Macmillan ninth. LSE Library. Public Domain. Women s rights were central to this blueprint. All delegates wishing to attend were required from the outset to pledge their support for women s suffrage, which the Congress organisers saw as inseparable from the objective of peace. A just world free of conflict, they argued, was impossible to achieve unless women were allowed to take their place alongside men as equal citizens. Enfranchisement, they claimed, would make peace more likely because of the role that women played as mothers in creating the life which war extinguished. Women, in the words of Jane Addams,  who have brought men into the world and nurtured them until they reach the age for fighting, must experience a peculiar revulsion when they see them destroyed, irrespective of the country in which these men may have been born . Despite the efforts of Addams and others to win support for their proposals after the Congress had closed, both women and their concerns were marginal to the negotiations in Paris in 1919, led by the victorious powers. Not one woman was appointed as a formal representative of her nation at the Peace Conference and while a small contingent of feminists travelled to Paris to lobby the official delegates, their demands fell on deaf ears. The US President, Woodrow Wilson, briefly raised the question of women s political representation with his fellow plenipotentiaries, but few wished to see women s rights recognised as a legitimate matter for international agreement. Where the Hague women saw peace and gender equality as fundamentally interlinked, the great powers in Paris were anxious to keep them separate, with women s citizenship firmly under the control of national governments. Given this failure, why is it worth remembering the 1915 Women s Congress at The Hague? The history of seemingly lost causes can tell us a great deal about how power works and, in this case, why women remained peripheral to international politics and diplomacy for so much of the 20th century. Today, the United Nations Security Council passes resolutions about women s inclusion in conflict resolution; governments host summits on rape as a weapon of war; and powerful non-governmental organisations ensure women are given a voice in debates about human rights, development and security. But history shows us that these achievements have been hard fought and won. They stand as testament to the efforts of generations of feminists who worked to make women s rights an international, and not just a national, concern. It would be too simplistic to draw a line of continuity between the Women s Congress of 1915 and today s policy debates. Much took place in the interim to reconfigure the global women s rights agenda, from interwar Fascism and the Cold War to the fall of European empires and the rise of new superpowers at the century s end. Nonetheless, at this moment when the legacy of the First World War is uppermost in the public mind, it is worth reflecting on how that conflict produced, through the voices of the women who gathered at The Hague, an analysis of the modern world in which gender equality, social justice and peace were intertwined. It is an analysis which endures a hundred years on. Helen McCarthy is Senior Lecturer in History at Queen Mary University of London.",

        "title": "Living with the dead? You need to know these 7 gruesome facts about the history of human burial",
        "content": "From the depths of prehistory, human societies have grappled with the same question: how do we treat the dead? Those many varying answers offer a valuable insight into how people across history have understood life, faith and human relationships. Ad From Tutankhamun s tomb to the mysterious Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo, many of the most famous   and culturally significant   historical and archaeological discoveries have centred around the notion of burial. It s for that reason that historian Roger Luckhurst, author of Graveyards: A History of Living with the Dead, thinks that burial practices say as much about the living and their societies, as they do about the dead. In a conversation on the HistoryExtra podcast, Luckhurst shared seven important (and unsettling) facts that trace how our relationship with death has evolved across history. 1. Homo sapiens weren t the first to bury our dead For centuries, archaeologists thought deliberate burial marked the beginning of humanity. Care for the dead, they argued, was the dividing line between Homo sapiens other human species, like Homo heidelbergensis or the Denisovans.  It used to be the case that archaeologists thought that they could identify Homo sapiens by how they cared for their dead,  Luckhurst says.  Actually, there are other versions of [archaic humans] who were burying their dead probably intentionally.  But recent discoveries have challenged that assumption. Read more | When and why did Neanderthals go extinct? Now, archaeological evidence seems to suggest that other human species, including Neanderthals, carefully laid their dead in shallow graves, possibly alongside flowers. One of the most famous examples is in Spain s Sima de las Palomas archaeological site, where a Neanderthal woman and her child seem to have been buried together, with their bodies positioned in a specific way. Far from the brutish caricature of early humans, Neanderthals may have shared our impulse to mark death as a meaningful part of life. 2. Nations recruit their dead to tell stories about themselves From ancient empires to modern democracies, death has always served politics in the form of monuments and memorials.  If you think about most national narratives, it's nearly always about the sacrifice of the people who founded the modern nation,  says Luckhurst.  In England we have this celebration of Memorial Day in November to mark the Armistice [at the end of the First World War]. And there are monuments in every village and every church for those who died in the two world wars.  Across Europe, the aftermath of the world wars turned graveyards into civic altars. Cenotaphs, war cemeteries and endless rows of white crosses framed sacrifice as the foundation of unity and national image. But the phenomenon of using the dead to tell a broader story extends beyond the West.  In Africa, one of my favourite graveyards is in Zimbabwe,  says Luckhurst,  where the cemetery is shaped like an AK-47 rifle because that's the rifle that the people buried there used as independence fighters   the graves are [shaped like] bullets in the magazine.  3. Lenin s corpse sparked a modern cult of preservation When Vladimir Lenin died in 1924, the newly formed Soviet Union faced a problem: how should its revolutionary hero be memorialised?  He died after the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun,  says Luckhurst,  and the Soviets thought,  There's a preserved body that s laid for thousands of years, why don't we do this with Lenin?  The embalmed body of Vladimir Lenin lies in state, preserved for public viewing after his death in 1924. Displayed in Moscow s Red Square, the Soviet leader s mausoleum became both a shrine to the revolution and a symbol of enduring political power.

The result was a body that has been preserved for nearly a century, tended to by teams of embalmers who still adjust his features under carefully controlled conditions.  [The Russians] even did this with Ho Chi Minh,  Luckhurst adds,  and kept it hidden for about six years until the Vietnam war was over.  What began as a self-contained Soviet experiment became a Cold War phenomenon, as other communist states adopted the same secular sainthood, embalming leaders from China s Mao Zedong to North Korea s Kim Il-sung. 4. Mummification began long before ancient Egypt The Egyptians made mummification famous, but they weren t the first to use it as a means of caring for their dead.  Mummification is a way of preserving a body by drying it out,  says Luckhurst,  but 2000 years before [ancient Egypt], in Chile there was a culture that was preserving bodies in a different kind of way.  Luckhurst was referring to the Chinchorro culture of coastal Chile and Peru, who as early as 5000 BC carefully prepared their dead with clay masks and natural salts. The region s arid air and saline soil acted as natural preservatives, inspiring deliberate human techniques.

The Catholic world turned bone piles into works of art In medieval and early modern Europe, churchyards filled up quickly. The dead were buried close to sanctified ground, and when space ran out, bones were exhumed to make room for others   leading to the establishment of the ossuary, a monument built to be filled with the bones of the dead. Perhaps the best-known example of an ossuary can be found in the French capital.  Underneath the streets of Paris are hundreds of thousands of skulls,  says Luckhurst.  It's a very Catholic practice and it's designed to help you contemplate death.  In the Catacombs of Paris, six million skeletons were arranged into geometric walls of skulls and femurs. In the Sedlec Ossuary of the Czech Republic, monks turned human bones into chandeliers and coats of arms. Meanwhile, the Capuchin Crypt in Rome displays skeletons posed in niches. These were all intended to show that death was part of salvation s cycle. In the Catacombs of Paris, a man studies a skull by torchlight amid towering stacks of bones. Once part of the city s vast network of quarries, the ossuary now holds the remains of millions of Parisians. (Photo by Getty Images) 6. The Romans built cities of the dead outside their cities of the living Ancient Rome regulated death with remarkable precision. By law, burials were forbidden within city limits, a rule designed to protect both hygiene and sanctity.  They built laws quite quickly that set out that you must bury the dead outside the city limits. And that's where the word  necropolis  comes from,  Luckhurst explains. Along the Via Appia, tombs of senators and freedmen lined the roadside. These necropoleis (literally  cities of the dead ) were public spaces that served as memorials and monuments. Visitors passing through could read inscriptions, admire the sculpture and reflect on the continuity between life and death. 7. Europe s graveyards became dangerously overcrowded By the late Middle Ages, after the disaster of the Black Death, death once again loomed over Europe   and as the population grew, so did the problem.  From the medieval period onwards, some societies decided that they were going to live with the dead, crammed around Christian churches in classic churchyards, but also in the walls or in the crypts of these churches as well. So they started to become part of the architecture in a fundamental way,  says Luckhurst.  But by the 18th century, you start getting a real crisis with people thinking,  What on earth are we going to do with all of these dead?  As cities expanded, burial grounds grew packed. Corpses were layered in shared plots, and decomposing bodies seeped into wells and cellars. In London, decay became a very real public health hazard. It was a crisis that led to reform, and a massive social change. From the early 19th century, the garden cemetery movement transformed burial into something akin to landscape design. New cemeteries such as P re Lachaise in Paris (1804) and Kensal Green in London (1832) created tree-lined avenues and manicured plots that restored order to how the dead were buried. It was a distinct shift. Now, people weren t surrounded by the dead in the cities; the dead were no longer ever-present. Instead, they were separated from the living   out of sight, and, eventually, out of mind. Ad Roger Luckhurst was speaking to Ellie Cawthorne on the HistoryExtra podcast.

        "title": "The real Arthur Guinness of House of Guinness And What Happened To Him",
        "content": "Since 1759, when the first Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease on St James s Gate Brewery in Dublin, generations of Guinnesses have grown the business, along with a vast fortune and a family legacy based on philanthropy as much as their stout. Ad House of Guinness, a drama now streaming on Netflix, explores a chapter of that fascinating family history in the way that only Peaky Blinders and SAS Rogue Heroes creator Steven Knight can. Starring a riotously charming Anthony Boyle (of Masters of the Air fame) as Arthur Guinness, the eight-part series bills itself as a 19th-century Succession, complete with sibling rivalries, political intrigue and a rebellious spirit   all mixed down with plenty of pints. Who was the real Arthur Guinness? The Arthur Guinness of House of Guinness is not the one who founded the brewery back in 1759. This is his great-grandson, Arthur Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun. He ran the brewery business alongside his brother Edward from 1868 to 1876, as well as sitting in the House of Commons as an MP and giving generously to a host of humanitarian causes. Born on 1 November 1840 in Dublin, Arthur was the eldest son of Elizabeth and Benjamin Lee Guinness, the man responsible for turning the brewery into a truly global giant. Growing up with two brothers, Benjamin and Edward, and a sister, Anne, he received an elite education at Eton and Trinity College Dublin, graduating in 1862.

(Image by Alamy) During its first three generations, Guinness had become the largest brewery in Ireland and a major exporter to Europe, the Americas and parts of Africa. Under the stewardship of Arthur and his youngest brother, Edward Guinness, the brewery continued to thrive; even the temperance movement, which bemoaned the social ills of alcohol, promoted the stout as a preferred alternative to spirits like gin and whiskey. What was Arthur s involvement in the brewery? For Arthur, 1868 would be a life-changing year, beginning with the death of his father. He was elevated to the title of Baronet Guinness of Ashford, which had been created just a year earlier to mark Benjamin Lee s achievements. His father left a fortune of  1.1 million (well over  100 million today) and the Guinness Brewery, the management of which became a partnership between Arthur and the youngest son, Edward. While the middle brother Benjamin and sister Anne received estates and money, they had no say in the business. In the first decade of their ownership, the success of Guinness only expanded, with sales more than doubling from around 350,000 barrels sold in 1868 to almost 779,000 in 1876. In the decades that followed, it would rise to more than a million a year. Was Arthur Guinness a philanthropist? As a major landowner in rural Ireland, Arthur had hundreds of poor tenants. Although more attentive than many landlords, this got him embroiled in the agrarian unrest and occasional violence of the 1880s, known as the Land War, in which several of his employees were murdered. Generally, though, he was considered a generous and conscientious figure, having learned the creed of the Guinness family to favour philanthropy and social responsibility over greed. Did Arthur Guinness commit election fraud? The year 1868 also saw Arthur s election to the UK Parliament as a Conservative MP for the City of Dublin, the seat previously been held by his father. Only a year later, however, the election was voided when it emerged that Guinness agents had used tactics that amounted to corruption and bribery, even offering  5 for every vote. When the matter went to court, it was concluded that Arthur himself had no idea this had happened.

(Image by Ben Blackall/Netflix) It would be another five years before he could win his seat back, in 1874, when he served under the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli until 1880. This was a time of widening divide in Ireland, between the Unionists who wished to stay part of the United Kingdom and nationalists seeking independence. Religion similarly divided the Irish between Protestant and Catholic. Read more | Who was to blame for the Irish famine? Arthur was a staunch Unionist and Protestant, as all generations of his family had been. In later life, he bought two Unionist newspapers and supported the Irish Unionist Alliance, and the Guinness Brewery s clear stance was cause for some anger among republicans. In 1880, Arthur left the House of Commons as he was raised to the peerage as Baron Ardilaun. What s known about Arthur Guinness s sexuality? In 1871, Arthur married Lady Olivia Charlotte Hedges-White, daughter of the Earl of Bantry. It seemed to be a happy marriage, although childless. The couple became known for their extravagant hospitality, hosting both Queen Victoria and the future George V, and they travelled widely. According to Joe Joyce, author of 2009 The Guinnesses: The Untold Story of Ireland s Most Successful Family, Arthur was  probably gay . Joyce also reported that both Arthur Guinness and the Baroness Ardilaun were content in maintaining the marriage under the agreement that there would be no sexual intercourse. It s a slender claim that the show has taken to heart and run with to riotous conclusions. Certainly, there was no way that same-sex relationships could have been accepted in tandem with success in public life   male homosexuality was legislated against in UK law, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. \"Sodomy (or buggery) were previously a hanging offence in Britain,\" writes Brian Lewis. \"This was modified by the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which replaced capital punishment with minimum sentences of 10 years  imprisonment. The Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 added to the statute book a two-year maximum penalty for 'gross indecency' between men.\" What happened to Arthur Guinness after the events of House of Guinness? In 1876, Arthur made the decision to step back from the brewery, selling his half of the shares to his brother for nearly  700,000. Although that figure made the younger Guinness a fabulously wealthy man, Edward would float the business a few years later on the London Stock Exchange, which made him a multi-millionaire. Arthur helped restore Marsh s Library and extend the Coombe Hospital in Dublin; he sponsored the building of housing for the poor; and, along with his brother, set up the Dublin Exhibition of Arts and Finance to encourage domestic trade. To this day, people can visit St Stephen s Green, a 22-acre public park that Arthur bought, landscaped and gifted to the city in the 1870s and 80s. Was Arthur Guinness assassinated? No, Arthur Guinness was not assassinated, or ever targeted by a Fenian plot to assassinate him. Arthur died on 20 January 1915, at the age of 74. He would be buried in the Dublin suburb of Raheny at All Saints  Church, the building of which he had helped fund several decades earlier. Ad House of Guinness is streaming on Netflix now.

        "title": "Queen Victoria: Guide & Timeline Of Her Life, Plus 16 Facts",
        "content": "At the time of her birth, Victoria was never expected to be queen. Yet upon the death of her uncle, King William IV, she succeeded him at the age of 18. She is remembered for her reign that spanned more than six decades, overseeing the expansion of the British empire for almost 64 years. Here are facts you need to know about the diminutive monarch   from her famed love and mourning for her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg, to the many attempts on her life  Ad Victoria was born fifth in line to the throne  Plump as a partridge  more of a pocket Hercules than a pocket Venus , is how the Duke of Kent described his spirited newborn daughter Princess Victoria when she was born on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace. Yet though she went on to become one of Britain s most iconic monarchs, Victoria s birth did not herald national celebration. As the daughter of King George III s fourth son, at the time of her birth Victoria was only fifth in line to the throne. Expected to be just another minor royal relative who would end up married into a European royal family, Victoria s arrival slipped under the radar somewhat. Few could have predicted that she would sit on the throne for more than 60 years. By the time Victoria reached her teens, however, the death of her father, his brothers and any other legitimate heirs left the young princess as King William IV s closest surviving heir. On 24 June 1819, the princess was christened in a low-key ceremony. Frustrated by his own inability to produce a surviving heir, Victoria s uncle, the Prince Regent, only allowed a handful of people to attend. Also under the direction of her uncle, she was given the name  Alexandrina Victoria . At the time, Victoria was far from a regal name   it was highly unusual and of French origin. When it became clear that Victoria would indeed accede to the throne, her name was seen to be completely inappropriate for a queen of England. She was advised to change it to something more traditional, but refused. Victoria as a child. (The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Queen Victoria had an unhappy childhood Victoria spent her formative years at Kensington Palace. However, in many ways the palace proved a prison for the princess, and her childhood there was far from rosy. Following her father s death from pneumonia when she was just eight months old, Victoria s early life was dominated by her mother, the Duchess of Kent, and her ambitious adviser Sir John Conroy. Keen to establish himself as the power behind the throne in the event of a Regency (in which Victoria s mother would rule with her if she acceded while still underage), Conroy sought to keep tight control of the princess. Both he and the Duchess had a hostile relationship with Victoria s uncle, King William, and consequently kept Victoria isolated from the royal court, even preventing her from attending her uncle s coronation. The pair imposed a stifling code of discipline on the young Victoria, which came to be known as the  Kensington System . Along with a strict timetable of lessons to improve her moral and intellectual rigor, this suffocating regime dictated that the princess spent hardly any time with other children and was under constant adult supervision. Right up until the time she became queen, Victoria was forced to share a bedroom with her mother. She was forbidden from ever being alone, or even walking down stairs without someone holding her hand. Later in life, Victoria reflected that she  led a very unhappy life as a child  and did not know what a happy domestic life was . She retained a deep-seated hatred of John Conroy for manipulating her mother and imposing such rigid rules on her, later describing him as  demon incarnate . Victoria was only 18 when she became queen  I went into my sitting room (only in my dressing gown) alone and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at twelve minutes past two this morning and consequently that I was Queen.  This is how Victoria recalled the moment that would change her life forever. At 6am on 20 June 1837, the young princess was woken from her bed to be informed that her uncle, King William IV, had died during the night. This meant that Victoria, who was only 18 at the time, was now queen of England. Although it came as a shock, Victoria took the news extremely stoically. Despite her young age she remained calm and had no need for the smelling salts her governess had prepared for her. In her first meeting with her privy council just a few hours later, Victoria s new ministers towered over her   at just 4ft 11, she had to be seated on a raised platform in order to be seen. What Victoria lacked in height, however, she made up for in determination, and she quickly made a favourable impression. A portrait of the young Queen Victoria by Franz Winterhalter. (Leemage/Corbis via Getty Images) Victoria had turned 18 less than a month before acceding to the throne. This was a crucial milestone, as it meant that she was able to rule under her own steam, rather than alongside her mother in a regency. She began her new life by moving away from her childhood home at Kensington to Buckingham Palace, in part to escape from the controlling influence of Conroy and her mother. Her relationship with her mother remained strained and distant for many years and she limited Conroy s influence at court. Just two years after Victoria took the throne, he resigned his post and left for Italy amid shame and scandal. In June the following year, Victoria was crowned in a five-hour-long ceremony at Westminster Abbey followed by a royal banquet and fireworks.  I shall ever remember this day as the proudest of my life  she recorded in her diary. Queen Victoria timeline: 9 milestones in the monarch's life 24 May 1819   Princess Victoria is born 20 June 1837   The young princess becomes a queen 1839   The Bedchamber crisis 10 February 1840   Queen Victoria marries Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha 21 November 1840   Victoria and Albert start a royal family 14 December 1861 - Prince Albert dies 1 January 1877 - Victoria becomes Empress of India 20 June 1887 and 22 June 1897   The nation celebrates Victoria s golden and diamond jubilees 22 January 1901   Queen Victoria dies Queen Victoria proposed to Prince Albert Though as a young woman she had many suitors, a key figure throughout Victoria s life and reign was her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Victoria met the German prince at Kensington Palace when the pair were both just 17. The meeting of Victoria and Albert, who were also first cousins, had been masterminded by Victoria s uncle, Leopold I of Belgium, who believed he could benefit politically from the match. Yet despite the marriage brokering that had led the couple to meet, this was most definitely a love match. Victoria s diary revealed that she found the young prince  extremely handsome . She wrote,  his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful . As royal tradition dictated that no one could propose to a reigning monarch, in October 1839 it was Victoria who proposed to Albert. Victoria's marriage was the first of a reigning queen of England in 286 years Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's wedding, which took place in St James s Palace chapel on 10 February 1840, was the first marriage of a reigning queen of England since Mary I in 1554. Victoria wore an 18-foot-long train carried by 12 bridesmaids and kicked off a modern-day tradition by wearing white. Outside, the nation erupted into huge public celebration. Victoria recorded how she  never saw such crowds of people  they cheered most enthusiastically . She reflected on the event as   the happiest day of my life . Over the course of their 21-year marriage, Victoria and Albert had a passionate, if sometimes tempestuous, relationship. Although the couple had blazing arguments, Victoria clearly adored her husband, describing him in her diary as  perfection in every way   oh how I adore and love him . Read more about Victoria and Albert's marriage Queen Victoria had nine children  but she hated being pregnant Just over nine months after their wedding, Victoria and Albert s first child, Princess Victoria, was born at Buckingham Palace. The queen soon after recorded how  after a good many hours suffering, a perfect little child was born  but alas! A girl & not a boy, as we both had so hoped & wished for . The royal couple s wishes were granted less than a year later, however, when Victoria gave birth to a male heir: Edward, known by the family as Bertie. Victoria and Albert went on to have a total of nine children   four boys and five girls. Surprisingly, Victoria hated being pregnant, and historians have suggested that she may have suffered from post-natal depression. She compared pregnancy to feeling like a cow and wrote that  an ugly baby is a very nasty object   and the prettiest is frightful when undressed . Many of Victoria s children were married into the royal families of Europe, yet throughout her life she maintained a close, perhaps even suffocating, relationship with them. She had a notoriously fractious relationship with her eldest son, the charismatic yet quick-tempered Bertie. Queen Victoria, her husband Prince Albert, and their nine children. (Photo by Rischgitz/Getty Images) The 1839 'Bedchamber Crisis' got Queen Victoria into trouble Victoria took the throne at a time when the monarch s role was intended to be largely apolitical. Yet early in her reign, the inexperienced queen got into hot water for meddling in political matters, in an event termed  The Bedchamber Crisis . The first prime minister of Victoria s reign was the Whig politician Lord Melbourne, with whom she enjoyed a remarkably close relationship. Melbourne held significant sway over the young queen, who appointed the majority of her ladies-in-waiting according to his advice. In 1839, Melbourne resigned following several parliamentary defeats. Tory Robert Peel stepped forward to become prime minister, on one condition: he requested that Victoria dismiss some of her existing household   who largely held Whig sympathies and were loyal to Melbourne   and replace them with Tory ladies. As many of Victoria s ladies-in-waiting were also her closest friends, she took offence at Peel s request and refused. The queen had already been criticised for her over-reliance on Lord Melbourne, and now she was widely condemned for being not just politically partisan, but unconstitutional. The tense situation was eventually defused by the ever-reasonable Prince Albert, who arranged for some of Victoria s ladies to resign their posts voluntarily. Queen Victoria spoke several languages Perhaps in part due to her strict schooling under the  Kensington system , Victoria proved herself to be a remarkably adept linguist. As well as being fluent in both English and German, she also spoke French, Italian and Latin. As her mother and governess both hailed from Germany, Victoria grew up speaking the language and at one stage reportedly even had a German accent, which had to be erased by tutors. When she later married her German cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the couple regularly spoke German together. Although Albert was fluent in English, he and Victoria could often be heard talking   and indeed arguing   in German when in private. Later in life, Victoria also experimented with some of the languages from across her vast empire. Following the arrival of Indian servants at Windsor Castle in August 1887, she was taught Hindustani and Urdu phrases by her favourite Indian attendant, Abdul Karim. The queen recorded in her diary: \"I am learning a few words of Hindustani to speak to my servants. It is a great interest to me for both the language and the people, I have naturally never come into real contact with before\". The queen's relationship with her prime ministers wasn t always easy Over the course of the six decades she sat on the throne, Victoria saw many prime ministers come and go. Yet while she established a remarkably close bond with some, others failed spectacularly to win her favour. Victoria s first prime minister, Lord Melbourne, was keen to flatter, instruct and influence the young queen from the very beginning. The pair were so close that Victoria claimed to love him  like a father . However, this intense friendship with  Lord M  made the queen unpopular with many   she was criticised for being politically partisan and was even mockingly called her  Mrs Melbourne . Later in her reign, Benjamin Disraeli similarly pulled out all the stops to win Victoria s favour with charm and flattery. His tactics clearly worked, as the queen told her eldest daughter [also named Victoria] that he would  do very well  and was  full of poetry, romance and chivalry . Other ministers, however, received a much less enthusiastic response from her majesty: she found Lord John Russell stubborn and rude and referred to Lord Palmerston as a  dreadful old man . As foreign secretary, Palmerston had invoked Victoria s wrath by ignoring Albert s suggested amendments to dispatches and apparently attempting to seduce one of her ladies-in-waiting. Victoria found Gladstone similarly infuriating, and with her characteristically sharp tongue dismissed him as a  half-crazy and in many ways ridiculous, wild and incomprehensible old fanatic . Britain's imperial conquests increased nearly fivefold during Victoria's reign Over the course of her reign, Victoria witnessed a mammoth expansion of the British empire. During her first 20 years on the throne, Britain s imperial conquests had increased almost fivefold. By the time she died, it was the largest empire the world had ever known and included a quarter of the world s population. As the monarchy was seen as a focal point for imperial pride, and a means of uniting the empire s disparate peoples, Victoria s image was spread across the empire. The queen herself took a great interest in imperial affairs. In 1877, prime minister Benjamin Disraeli pronounced her empress of India in a move to cement Britain s link to the  jewel in the empire s crown . The queen had pushed for the title for several years, but, concerned about its absolutist connotations, Disraeli had been hesitant to agree. By 1877, however, Victoria had become so insistent he felt he could not resist any longer, for fear of offending her. Queen Victoria was known as the  grandmother of Europe  Over the course of their 21-year marriage, Victoria and Albert raised nine children together. As a means of extending Britain s influence and building international allegiances, several of their sons and daughters were married into various European monarchies, and within just a couple of generations Victoria s descendants were spread across the continent. Her 42 grandchildren could be found in the royal families of Germany, Russia, Greece, Romania, Sweden, Norway and Spain. Warring First World War royals Kaiser Wilhelm (of Germany), Tsarina Alexandra (of Russia) and George V (of Britain) were all grandchildren of Victoria. Kaiser Wilhelm reportedly remarked that had his grandmother still been alive, the First World War may never have happened, as she simply would not have allowed her relatives to go to war with one another. Queen Victoria with her children and grandchildren. Kaiser Wilhelm II is pictured left in the front row. (Photo by Bettmann via Getty Images) Victoria s widespread influence had unexpected genetic, as well as political, implications for Europe s monarchies. It is believed that the queen was a carrier of haemophilia and had unwittingly introduced the rare inherited disease into her bloodline. Over subsequent generations the condition resurfaced in royal families across the continent. In an age of limited medical facilities, haemophilia   which affects the blood s ability to clot   could have disastrous consequences. Victoria s own son Leopold suffered from the disease and died aged 30 after he slipped and fell, triggering a cerebral haemorrhage. Three of the queen s grandchildren also suffered from the disease, as did her great-grandson, the murdered heir to the Russian throne, Tsarevich Alexei. Listen | Deborah Cadbury shows how Queen Victoria sought to influence the future of Europe through the marriages of her descendants Queen Victoria survived at least six assassination attempts During the course of her 63-year-long reign, Victoria came out unscathed from at least six serious attempts on her life, some of which were terrifyingly close calls. In June 1840, while four months pregnant with her first child, Victoria was shot at while on an evening carriage ride with Prince Albert. For a moment it seemed as though the queen had been hit, but Albert spurred the driver to speed away to safety and the would-be assassin, Edward Oxford, was apprehended. Oxford   who was later acquitted on grounds of insanity   proved to be the first of many to target the queen while she was driving in her open-top carriage. In 1850, as the carriage slowed down to pass through the gates of Buckingham Palace, retired soldier Robert Pate ran forward and managed to strike the queen sharply on the head with a small cane. Although it transpired that the cane weighed less than three ounces, so could not have done much damage, the incident nonetheless unnerved Victoria. She escaped several more assassination attempts while riding in her carriage in 1842, 1849 and 1872. Victoria was also infamously targeted by a stalker   a notorious teenager known in the newspapers as  The Boy Jones . Between 1838 and 1841, Edward Jones managed to break into Buckingham Palace several times, hiding under the queen s sofa, sitting on her throne and reportedly even stealing her underwear, before being caught. Victoria mourned Prince Albert for 40 years On 14 December 1861, Victoria s life was rocked by the death of her beloved husband, Albert. As the prince was aged just 42 and generally enjoyed good health, his death from typhoid was highly unexpected. It came as a huge blow to the queen, who had been intensely reliant on his support, practically and politically as well as emotionally. Read more about Prince Albert's death Following Albert s death, Victoria retreated from public life, adopting elaborate mourning rituals that rapidly became obsessive. As time went on, the situation began to spiral out of control as it became clear the queen s period of mourning would last much longer than the two years that convention dictated. Consumed by grief, Victoria fell into a state of depression and began neglecting her royal duties. As she repeatedly refused to take part in public events, her popularity began to deteriorate. The British people began to lose patience with their queen, questioning what the  Widow of Windsor  did to earn her royal income. It was not until the 1870s that Victoria was coaxed back into gradually engaging in public life once more. Queen Victoria had a set of clothes laid out for Prince Albert each morning, right up until her own death 40 years later in 1901 Despite the decades that passed, Victoria never fully recovered from the loss of Albert. Although she had other intimate relationships   most notably a close friendship with her Scottish servant John Brown   she never remarried. She continued to wear black and sleep beside an image of Albert, and she even had a set of clothes laid out for him each morning, right up until her own death 40 years later in 1901.

Her golden and diamond jubilees of 1887 and 1897 were crucial to restoring her reputation. Designed to be show-stopping crowd-pleasers, these national festivities reinvented the  widow of Windsor  as a source of national (and imperial) pride and celebration. Grand processions and military displays were jam-packed with patriotic pomp, while Victoria s face was plastered on all manner of commemorative products. During 1897 s diamond jubilee (marking Victoria s 60th year on the throne), street parties, parades, fireworks and cricket games took place across the country. Some 300,000 of Britain s poor were treated to a special jubilee dinner, while in India 19,000 prisoners were pardoned. During a royal procession to St Paul s Cathedral, Victoria was reportedly so overwhelmed by the cheering crowds that she burst into tears. Queen Victoria was buried with a lock of John Brown's hair As she entered her eighties, Victoria was still actively taking on her royal duties. Yet, after six decades on the throne, her health finally began to decline. After being diagnosed with  cerebral exhaustion , Queen Victoria died at the age of 81 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, on 22 January 1901. The queen had refused to be embalmed, so part of the preparations that followed her death included preparing the coffin to combat the smell and absorb moisture, by scattering coal across its floor. The queen's staff also cut off her hair, dressed her in a white silk dressing gown with garter ribbon and star and placed her wedding veil over her face, before summoning members of the queen's family   the royal dukes, the kaiser and the new king, Edward VII   to lift her body into the coffin. The family then retired, leaving staff to carry out the queen s secret instructions that were never to be revealed to her children. The wedding ring of the mother of her personal servant, John Brown, was placed on her finger; a photograph of Brown and a lock of his hair were laid beside her, along with Brown s pocket handkerchief, all carefully hidden from view. The queen was buried beside her beloved Prince Albert on 4 February 1901, in the mausoleum the queen had built for her husband at Frogmore, adjoining Windsor Castle. Queen Victoria was succeeded by Edward VII, her eldest son Victoria and Albert's first son and second child was named Albert Edward, although he was known as  Bertie . As Prince of Wales, he had a love of society and 'good living' and was known for his hearty appetites, Bertie   who was crowned King Edward VII on 9 August 1902   defied expectations by proving himself to be a very successful and well-loved monarch.

        "title": "Queen Victoria's unhappy childhood: life under the 'Kensington System'",
        "content": "On 24 May 1819, a baby girl was born at Kensington Palace. It was then the least fashionable of the royal palaces, hidden away behind the lime trees of its wide green gardens to the west of London. Ad The arrival of Alexandrina Victoria, as she was christened, did cause some excitement. A long line of carriages calling for news about the health of the mother, the Duchess of Kent, reached all the way to Hyde Park Corner. But at that point the new baby, King George III s latest granddaughter, was fairly low down the royal pecking order. As the years of her childhood passed, however, and as her elder cousins failed to thrive and died, Alexandrina Victoria grew in importance. It gradually emerged that the little girl growing up quietly behind closed doors at Kensington Palace would one day reign over the whole of the British Isles, including Ireland. And, in due course, a quarter of the globe s landmass. The young Victoria with her mother, Victoire, Duchess of Kent, in an 1821 portrait by William Beechey. \"My greatest of fears was that I loved her too much,\" said Victoire. (Photo by Kean Collection/Getty Images) The death of Queen Victoria's father Just as Queen Victoria s path to the throne was not obvious at the time of her birth, her education and training for the position seem at first sight to have been quite shockingly inadequate. One of the problems was the early loss of her father, the Duke of Kent. He had terrible debts, caused partly by an expensive refurbishment of his apartment at Kensington. In the winter of 1819 20, he tried to save money by taking his beloved wife and baby daughter to live cheaply in a rented holiday house, out-of-season, at Sidmouth in Devon. There he caught pneumonia and passed away. This left his widowed duchess, whose name was Victoire, in a difficult position. German, and only recently married to her duke, she spoke no English and felt ostracised by the rest of the royal family. She had few resources, either financial or intellectual, on which to fall back for the care of her daughter. One person who knew Victoire, Duchess of Kent, described her as  very delightful, in spite of want of brains . If she was scatty and disorganised, she was also warm and loving. Her late husband s will now placed Victoire in an unusual situation. Normally, a child in the line of succession would be handed over to the reigning monarch for education and guardianship. But the Duke of Kent had loved and trusted his wife, and made her guardian of their daughter instead. This was a duty Victoire intended to carry through. The rest of the royal family would perhaps have preferred it if she d slipped back off to her native Germany   but Victoire remained. The daunting implication was that, if her daughter came to the throne before she was 18, Victoire herself would become regent of Britain. She would effectively be reigning over a country of which she could not even speak the language. She wasn t allowed to sleep alone, play with other girls or even walk downstairs without someone holding her hand Unfortunately, Victoire lacked confidence in herself.  I am not fit for my place, no, I am not,  she would say.  I am just an old stupid goose.  No wonder that she now fell into the outstretched hands of a man on whom she would come greatly to rely: her late husband s adjutant from his army days, John Conroy. Who was Sir John Conroy? Conroy was a 6ft, black-haired, good-looking chancer from an Irish background. It's easy to see how Victoire was forced by necessity, loneliness and incapacity to depend on the man who became her advisor and factotum (an employee who takes on several types of work). Her husband's death had left her both distraught and penniless. Her brother Leopold came down to Sidmouth to help out, but failed to bring her any ready money. \"Gut, gut Leopold,\" as Victoire called him, in her German accent, was nevertheless \"rather slow in the uptake and in making decisions\". It was Conroy, with his \"activity and capability\", who arranged a loan for her at Coutts bank. Sir John Conroy, comptroller of the Duchess of Kent's household. (Image by Getty Images) And Conroy could see, as the duchess s chief advisor, that he might one day become the power behind the throne. He encouraged Victoire and the little Victoria to go back to live at Kensington Palace, and there devised something called the  System , a set of strict rules under which the princess would live. What was the Kensington System? It sounds rather sinister, and on some levels it was. At its most basic, the System (as Conroy himself called it, with capital S) was for the young Victoria s personal safety. It demanded she be kept in semi-seclusion at Kensington Palace. Behind the garden walls, she d be isolated from both disease and assassination attempts. Secondly, the fact that she was rarely seen at court distanced her, in people s minds, from the unpopular regime of her uncles, Kings George and then William IV. As a possible future queen, she d remain untainted by association with them. She would be a fresh start   or, as Conroy put it,  the Nation s Hope . But thirdly   and sinisterly   the System also seems to have been about breaking Victoria s spirit, and getting her to submit. It contained an element of surveillance: she wasn t allowed to sleep alone, play with other girls or even walk downstairs without having someone holding her hand. And each day she had to write in her  Behaviour Book  how well   or badly   she d behaved (see more rules below). On the podcast | Professor Jane Ridley reveal lesser-known aspects of Queen Victoria's life Accounts of Queen Victoria s childhood usually take at face value her adult recollections of this period in her life, in which she complained of trauma and loneliness. But it s also worth bearing in mind that she did have a natural tendency to make a drama out of her own life. And perhaps there were some elements of the System that helped to make her reign a success. There is no doubt that Conroy was indeed a manipulative bully, but there is also something more to his poor reputation among historians than just Victoria s well-recorded dislike. The snobbish court establishment looked down on his lack of an aristocratic background. Born in Wales to Anglo-Irish parents   his father was a barrister   Conroy had reached his position of influence entirely by his own efforts, which contemporaries found troubling. Secondly, if the System Conroy had devised had three components, the first two were wildly successful. He did keep Victoria safe. And, through a carefully stage-managed series of public appearances in her teenage years, he did manage to create an enormous groundswell of warmth for her when, eventually, she became queen. The Kensington System that governed Queen Victoria's childhood Victoria was not allowed to spend time by herself and she always had to sleep in her mother s room. Victoria could not walk downstairs without holding the hand of an adult in case she fell. (It sounds melodramatic, but Victoria did actually confirm in later life that this was a rule she had to abide by.) Victoria was not allowed to meet any strangers or third parties without her governess being present. The young Victoria had to write in a  Behaviour Book  how well she d behaved each day, so that her mother could assess her progress. Sometimes it was good, sometimes  VERY NAUGHTY . Victoria could only appear in public on carefully stage-managed  publicity tours . This was to distance her from the unpopular regime of her uncles, Kings George IV and William IV, and to present her as  the Nation s Hope . Victoria was not allowed to dance the scandalous and intimate new dance called the waltz, not even (as is often said) with other royal relations. She would never waltz until married to Prince Albert. Victoria had to build up her strength by exercising with her Indian clubs [a pair of bowling-pin shaped wooden clubs] and a machine with pulleys and weights, and was mandated to have plenty of fresh air. She would be a life-long devotee of open windows, to the extent that her courtiers would always be shivering. The young Victoria was not allowed to gorge on her food. She was allowed to eat bread with milk and plain roast mutton, and was restricted from eating her favourite things: sweetmeats and fruit. Young Victoria's publicity tours One of the items on display in an exhibition at Kensington Palace is the small wooden travelling bed that Victoria used for another strand of Conroy s System: the country-wide  publicity tours  that he organised for her. Taking her on closely choreographed visits to provincial towns and nobleman s houses around Britain gave her future subjects an intriguing glimpse of their future monarch. It was a strategy that paid off entirely. When, in the early hours of 20 June 1837, the 18-year-old Victoria was woken up at Kensington Palace with news that her uncle had died in the night, she was able to emerge   as Conroy had planned   as a fresh start for the monarchy. The home-loving Victoria would become the perfect pin-up for a country tired of the debauchery and excesses of previous kings Victoria's journey to the throne was a struggle. But once she was queen, she would not long remain at Kensington Palace. She removed herself as quickly as she could to the relative freedom of Buckingham Palace instead. There s a well-known and compelling narrative that sees Victoria, on her accession day, cutting free of the System to the extent, even, of changing her name. When called on to sign her name, the new queen put just plain  Victoria    not the  Alexandrina Victoria  of her christening. It s widely believed that she was called  Drina  in childhood, rather than Victoria, and that the change symbolised a break from the past. But her mother had some time earlier agreed that the  Alexandrina  should be dropped quietly, and her toys are marked with a  V . The duchess had, in any case, also called her daughter by the pet name of  Vickelchen . How did the Kensington System affect Victoria? So the System was not entirely a black-and-white affair. Even the most unpleasant aspect of it, that of surveillance, perhaps had an unintended benefit. It toughened Victoria up. She would have to face a lifetime of being watched and judged. The Behaviour Books were just the start. As her mother explained to her:  You cannot escape  from the situation you are born in.  Victoria might as well be given the chance to get used to living under watch and under pressure. This was far from normal for a 19th-century girl, who was expected by society to shrink away from attention. But even Victoria s Uncle Leopold, an enemy of Conroy s, likewise coached his niece about the element of performance that would be so central to her role as a constitutional monarch.  High personages are a little like stage actors,  he explained.  They must always make efforts to please their public.  Queen Victoria as a young woman, c1835. (Image by Getty Images) Harsh judgement has sometimes been heaped upon the Duchess of Kent for not standing up to Conroy when he bullied her. But while Victoire lacked moral fibre, that did not make her a bad person, and this too is something that Victoria herself in later life came to appreciate. As Victoire explained, she d simply done her best for her daughter.  My greatest of fears was that I loved her too much,  she said. And what Victoire did bequeath to her daughter was a huge capacity for love. Most royals of the early 19th century could not afford to look for love in their marriages, which were pragmatic affairs undertaken for blood or politics. Yet Victoire, creature of an age in which romantic novels were beginning to provide a new template for living, had sought and found a soulmate in her husband. She brought up her daughter to desire the same thing   and Queen Victoria's marriage to Prince Albert was a love match. Victoria came in later life to realise the love her mother had felt for her   despite the System   and she also spent her childhood watching her mother defer so much to the advice of a man. The result of this was that she herself, in due course, would cling all the more closely to her own family. And in doing so, Queen Victoria would model for the media and the nation a domestic life that was more than acceptable to the age in which she lived. The dutiful queen The industrial revolution had allowed a man, working in industry or business, to earn enough money to keep his wife at home, untroubled by the outside world. In her own family life, Victoria would become a kind of super-Victorian: submissive to her husband, Prince Albert, apparently devoted to her children   the perfect pin-up for a populace tired of the debauchery, the mistresses and the general excesses of previous kings. But while the young Victoria was loved to the extent of being spoilt, there were still terrible gaps in her more formal education. The System had given her nothing more than the standard education for a genteel young lady being prepared for marriage. The majority of her time was spent on music, drawing (at which she excelled), dancing, religion, French and German. Her tutors reported her as  indifferent  at spelling, but  good  at most other subjects.  The rest of her education,  one of Victoria s prime ministers later noted,  she owes to her own natural shrewdness and quickness.  While the young Victoria was loved to the extent of being spoilt, there were still terrible gaps in her more formal education But there was also a curious advantage to having a queen who relied on her  natural shrewdness . It made her an instinctive, populist politician in a way that her classically educated male court and cabinet could never really appreciate. When she did ultimately come to write a book, for example, it was far from a learned tome. She published an account of holidays she d taken in Scotland, which became a huge success and a runaway bestseller. Its rather banal content appealed directly to the people among her subjects who mattered, the people who held the balance of political power in the 19th century: the middle class. While other monarchies across Europe were being threatened by revolution, the British monarchy survived the 19th century unscathed. This was not least because the middle classes thought that their undereducated, dutiful, home-loving queen simply wasn t worth overthrowing. It was not the result that Conroy s strange  System  was intended to achieve. Victoria would look back on her Kensington childhood with horror and regret. But far from being the breaking of her, you could argue that Victoria s unusual childhood was in fact the making of her reign.

        "content": "The year 1900 had been Queen Victoria s annus horribilis:  a horrible year, nothing but sadness and horrors of one kind & another,  she wrote. Ad The Boer War (1899 1902, fought between Great Britain and two Afrikaner republics) weighed heavily on her mind, and the lifting of the sieges against Mafeking and Ladysmith in early 1900 had done little to relieve her anxiety. In April, her eldest son the Prince of Wales had been shot at as he travelled through Belgium, by a young boy protesting against the war. Her eldest daughter   Vicky, the Dowager Empress of Germany   had been diagnosed with incurable breast cancer that had spread to her spine, and the empress was languishing in great pain in her castle in Kronberg. In August 1900, a telegram had arrived announcing that her favourite son   the chain-smoking, heavy drinking Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh   had died from throat cancer.  Oh! God! my poor darling Affie gone too! My 3rd Grown up child. It is hard at 81!  she wrote. A few weeks later she received the news that her much-loved grandson, Prince Christian Victor, eldest son of her daughter Princess Helena, had succumbed to enteric fever while serving with the British Army in South Africa. On Christmas day, Jane, Lady Churchill, the queen s oldest and most trusted friend, was found dead in her bed while staying with the queen at Osborne House.  I am sending for my mourning trappings  observed Marie Mallet, maid of honour to the queen,  we never escape jet for long . The fading queen As Queen Victoria ended the 19th century, she was not her usual self. She was visibly fading: her voracious appetite had disappeared and she had lost almost half her body weight. She was confined to a wheelchair, almost blind and had lapses of memory and moments of confusion. Yet no one could contemplate the mortality of the little old lady who had sat on the throne for almost 64 years. Her children were in denial, her government was unprepared, and the public knew nothing at all. Victoria's own view of the future was bleak:  Another year begun, I am feeling so weak and unwell, that I enter upon it sadly.  Twenty-two days later, shortly after 6.30pm on Tuesday 22 January 1901, Superintendent Fraser ordered the household police to surround the queen s Isle of Wight residence Osborne House. All telephone and telegraph wires were to be suspended, and any servant or messenger to be prevented from leaving. A short while later he walked down the long gravel drive to the entrance gate where a large crowd was waiting, and pinned a small notice on to the bulletin board.  Osborne House, January 22, 6.45pm Her Majesty the Queen breathed her last at 6.30pm, surrounded by her children and grand-children.  And so the news of the queen s passing was announced to the world. Her death stunned the nation. What followed was chaos and confusion. There was no one alive who could remember how to bury a monarch and this queen had asked for a full military state funeral. Osborne House, Isle of Wight, where Queen Victoria spent her final days. The queen died at the residence on 22 January 1901. (Photo by The Print Collector/Getty Images) How did Queen Victoria die? The queen's terminal decline had been rapid and had taken the family by surprise. Her children squabbled, her doctors quarrelled, and the public were misled and kept in the dark. Sir James Reid, the queen s personal physician for more than 20 years, had known the end was nigh but had great difficulty convincing the royal family of the inevitable, even in the final days when they saw the queen was drifting between delirium and lucidity. Princess Helena and Princess Beatrice, the queen s daughters and constant companions, could not accept that their mother could actually die and tried to maintain business as usual. The Prince of Wales was reluctant to cancel his weekend jaunts to the country; the Duke of Connaught [the seventh child of Victoria and Albert] was on his way to Berlin to celebrate 200 years of the Prussian monarchy; while other members of the royal family enjoyed a performance of Little Nell in London s West End. In desperation, Reid secretly telegraphed the queen s grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany. On receipt of the telegram, the kaiser immediately cancelled the celebrations and left Berlin with the Duke of Connaught and set sail for England, throwing the squabbling family into turmoil and forcing them to make public news of the queen s illness. This unexpected announcement took the nation completely by surprise and rumours began to abound.  Queen Unconscious, Sinking Fast  read one headline,  Queen Rallying: Has Eaten and Slept. Official  read another. The queen had been as reluctant to accept her mortality as those around her and had appeared to rally.  Am I better?  she asked Sir James,  I should like to live a little longer, as I have still a few things to settle.  As if her trusted doctor could make her live, Sir James kindly reassured her:  Yes, Your Majesty has been very ill but you are now better.  Meanwhile the Prince of Wales and his sisters (known as  the petticoats ) tried to prevent the kaiser reaching Osborne. Events took a dramatic turn for the worse from 17 January as the queen suffered a series of strokes and the entire royal family was suddenly summoned to the Isle of Wight. The government ground to a halt as the queen was no longer able to carry out her constitutional duties. There were talks of a regency, while Osborne House   already overflowing with guests   was bombarded with anxious telegrams and telephone calls, and journalists gathered excitedly outside the gates.

(Photo by Time Life Pictures/Mansell/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images) The queen began to sink as the family crowded into her small bedroom where the Bishop of Winchester and the Rector of St Mildred s Church chanted prayers and hymns. The kaiser sat motionless at her left side for more than two hours, propping her up with his one good arm, while Sir James Reid sat on her right holding her hand. The queen, conscious but unable to see, lamented repeatedly:  Sir James, I'm very ill.  Each time Reid replied:  Your Majesty will soon be better.  A young nurse knelt on the back of the bed, supporting the queen s head. As the room filled with the sound of sobbing and weeping mingled with the chanting of the clerics, each son, daughter and grandchild was summoned by name to kiss the queen's hand and say farewell. News of Victoria s death When the end came, Osborne House was surrounded by police to prevent the news leaking out before the new king Edward VII had concluded the formalities. A short while later, the small notice of announcement was pinned on the bulletin board where a large crowd of journalists were waiting. A crowd of carriages set off at gallop. Bicycles careered down the hill. And men ran along bawling at the top of their voices \"Queen dead\". All of this could be seen and heard as the press rushed down to the harbour to break the news to the world. An early 20th-century illustration depicts the announcement of Queen Victoria's death. (Photo by Alamy) The London Evening News had a black-bordered special edition out on the street within the hour. Theatre performances were interrupted as audiences poured out into the streets. The  Great Tom  bell of St Paul s tolled across the city of London. Across the nation, people gathered in small groups to sing  God Save the Queen  and by eight o clock, shop windows were dressed in black mourning; Whiteleys department store in London had queues ten deep as customers lined up to purchase their black mourning outfits. Meanwhile, panic broke out in the royal household as they realised that all precedents were 64 years out of date, and nobody knew what to do.  The ignorance of historical precedent in men whose business it is to know is wonderful,  wrote Reginal Brett, Viscount Esher.  I cannot describe to you the historical ignorance, of everyone from top to bottom   who should know something of procedure. You would think that the English Monarchy had [not] been buried since the time of Alfred.  Panic also gripped the government when the queen s personal instructions for her funeral were revealed. Previous royal funerals had been private candlelit affairs, taking place at night, but this queen had requested a full military state funeral. No embalming, no lying-in-state, no mourning black; she wanted a white funeral, purple and white, with white ponies and a gun carriage, and the first burial of a monarch outside the confines of Westminster Abbey and St George s Chapel since George I. Funeral preparations: Victoria's coffin, death mask, and secret instructions The Earl Marshal [the royal officer in charge of organising royal ceremonies and processions] and Lord Chamberlain [in charge of the royal household] were at loggerheads as to who should take charge, while the new king s household refused to take over responsibility until the queen was buried   yet the old queen s household no longer had any authority. The Accession council was hastily convened, where the Lord Mayor had to be forcibly ejected, and to the consternation of those present the king extemporised his accession speech.

(Photo by Reinhold Thiele/Thiele/Getty Images) The casting of a death mask was ordered by the kaiser, causing uproar among the royal family as it was known the queen had disliked the use of such masks. The Duke of York was suddenly struck down with a dangerous illness and the royal undertaker arrived from London but forgot to bring the coffin. The Lord Chamberlain refused to cooperate with the Earl Marshal, and the kaiser turned on the Bishop of Winchester, who had been the queen s favourite cleric, saying that if he were his cleric he would have him hauled out into the courtyard by the neck and shot. Sir Frederick Ponsonby, the queen s assistant private secretary, travelled to London to discover the Earl Marshal s office in total chaos with nothing arranged. In desperation, he called on Lord Roberts, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the British Army, who gave Ponsonby carte blanche to organise the military as he saw fit. There were only a few days left to organise the ceremonial. A February 1901 drawing from L'Illustration, showing Queen Victoria on her death bed. (Photo by Culture Club/Getty Images) The royal coffin was built by a local carpenter and delivered to Osborne House. The doctor Reid, with the help of Mrs Tuck, the queen s devoted dresser, prepared the queen for her coffin. The queen had refused to be embalmed, so they scattered charcoal on the floor of the coffin to combat the smell and absorb the moisture. They cut off her hair, dressed her in a white silk dressing gown with garter ribbon and star and placed her wedding veil over her face. They summoned the royal dukes, the kaiser and the new king to lift her body into the coffin. The family then retired, leaving Reid and Mrs Tuck to carry out the queen s secret instructions   never to be revealed to her children. The wedding ring of the mother of her personal servant, John Brown, was placed on her finger; a photograph of Brown and a lock of his hair were laid beside her, along with Brown s pocket handkerchief, all carefully hidden from view. The queen was now ready for her final journey. Queen Victoria s funeral procession As the date of the funeral approached, the processional route was prepared. Around 33,000 soldiers entered London and had to be fed and billeted. Advertisements appeared offering seats in windows and balconies overlooking the route for 25 guineas ( 3,000). In a fit of pique the Pope, \"unwilling to be represented at the funeral of a Protestant Queen , refused to send a representative or to allow an official mass to be said for the queen, while businesses demanded that the year of mourning be reduced, fearful of its effect on trade. Meanwhile, information reached Gustav Steinhauer, a personal bodyguard to the kaiser, of an assassination plot by three notorious anarchists. They intended to kill the kaiser and Leopold II, King of the Belgians, during the funeral procession. Scotland Yard was informed. On 1 February 1901, the cortege crossed the Solent, flanked by 11 miles of battleships and cruisers, each booming out their  minute  guns as the tiny yacht Alberta passed by, bearing the queen s coffin. The cortege remained in the harbour overnight and proceeded by train to London s Victoria station in the early hours of 2 February. This was followed by the largest military procession since the Duke of Wellington s funeral in 1852, through Hyde Park to Paddington. The procession lasted two hours, with the queen s coffin standing high on the gun carriage drawn by eight white and cream ponies through the crowded   yet eerily silent   streets. Then came the final train journey to Windsor, where the procession waited as the coffin was placed on the gun carriage. More complications followed when the horses, having stood motionless in the freezing weather, suddenly kicked and broke away from their traces, almost toppling the coffin to the ground. The front of the procession had already marched off and reached the end of Windsor Street before it could be stopped and turned around. The Royal Horse Artillery were unable to re-harness the horses and disaster loomed. Prince Louis Battenberg (grandfather of Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh) rescued the day, suggesting:  If it is impossible to mend the traces you can always get the naval guard of honour to drag the gun carriage.  Accordingly, 138 bluejackets piled their arms [propped up their weapons], attached ropes to the carriage where the harnesses had been, and dragged the gun carriage to St George s Chapel by hand, giving birth to a new royal tradition. (You can see the moving images of this procession on British Path s newsreel). Crowds line the streets to watch the funeral cortege of Queen Victoria in February 1901. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The service in St George s Chapel was also chaotic. The clerical procession, led by two Archbishops, arrived an hour too early and had to stand patiently in the nave, which was half-empty owing to a major blunder by the Earl Marshal. The earl s officials were seen dragging guests from their seats to spread them out in order to hide the mistake, while the uncooperative Lord Chamberlain tried to explain why he had requested that the women guests should come  in trousers . The official service was followed by a moving ceremony for the family on 4 February, in the mausoleum the queen had built for her husband at Frogmore, adjoining Windsor Castle. King Edward VII and his grandson, the six-year-old future Edward VIII, knelt with the kaiser as the queen was slowly lowered in to the crypt to be laid to rest beside her beloved Prince Albert. Queen Victoria's funeral on film Joanna Bourke examines newsreel footage of Queen Victoria's \"remarkable\" funeral procession in February 1901 The film clearly demonstrates the influence of royalty (five reigning monarchs, as well as many other members of royal families, accompanied Edward VII in the procession), as well as the prestige of the empire, navy and army. It also testifies to the imagery surrounding Queen Victoria, as both pious and feminine, yet a formidable leader. The funeral was prolonged. The coffin had to be transported from Osborne House to the port of Cowes, then across the Solent on the royal yacht Alberta. One reporter recalled looking at the new king (who was aboard another yacht) through his telescope. Although he was a quarter of a mile away, the reporter observed that Edward s face was  so white and very set, the real king, unaware that any man could see him, intensely melancholy, intensely sad . It was, he added, a  sacrilege to gaze, and I turned the glass and looked no more . How much did Queen Victoria's funeral cost? The funeral had cost  35,500 ( 4.5 million). As the Westminster Gazette reported after the funeral, the queen had outlived all the members of her Privy Council who were alive in 1837; all the peers who had held their titles in 1837 (except Earl Nelson, who was 14 in that year) and all the members who had sat in the House of Commons at the time of her accession. She saw 10 prime ministers; five Archbishops of Canterbury and six commanders-in-chief; 18 presidents of the United States; 11 Viceroys of Canada; 16 Viceroys of India and France successively ruled by one king; one emperor and seven presidents of a Republic. She had also outlived all nine of her bridesmaids.  In a funeral at sea the ship is slowed down when the body is committed to the deep but once that has taken place there can be no waiting   the order is  Full Steam Ahead ,  the Gazette reported.  It is so with national affairs. Everything has been slowed down to do honour to our Queen, but the ship of state cannot tarry long. Full steam ahead is today's order   just because it can be nothing else.

        "title": "Dumpy  dowager or vibrant beauty: what did Queen Victoria really look like, and how tall was she?",
        "content": "Prior to the arrival of TV series Victoria in 2016 (which first aired in Britain on ITV and later on PBS America) most of us, when imagining Queen Victoria, would have had in mind her incarnation in the 1997 film Mrs Brown, as the elderly, difficult and often irascible monarch played by Judi Dench. Ad Photographs of the queen during the long period of her widowhood from 1861 (following the death of her husband, Prince Albert) to her own death in 1901 only underline the image of the unsmiling dowager dressed in black   a woman with no interest in clothes, in fashion or her own physical attractiveness. But of course, Queen Victoria did not always look so sober, jowly and humourless. She was in fact once very vibrant and lovely, with an arresting personality and huge amounts of energy for music, dancing and staying up late.

When she was still Princess Alexandrina   or simply  Drina , as her mother called her   she was rather beautiful,  cherubic  even. Her features were  clustered round by glossy fair ringlets ; her complexion  remarkably transparent, with a soft and often heightening tinge of the sweet blush rose upon her cheeks, that imparted a peculiar brilliancy to her clear blue eyes , as one observer gushed in the 1820s.

In 1831 Victoria s governess, Baroness Lehzen, described her 12-year-old charge as  very pretty , although there was no getting away from her lack of stature: the princess had a  graceful figure , and, Lehzen noted,  a very small foot . The court diarist Charles Greville, however, was rather unkind, thinking the young princess a rather  short vulgar-looking child .

In 1846, an American visitor to London who had attended one of the queen s receptions described her as a  pleasing lady-like little woman  whose height  cannot exceed five feet . Some writers have stated that she was shorter than this: 4  10  or 4  11 . However, in her recent biography of the queen historian Lucy Worsley revealed that the portrait painter Thomas Sully, who executed one of the first and most lovely portraits of the young Queen Victoria in 1838, claimed to have measured her with a tape measure at 5  1  precisely.

But despite all his advice on her diet, Victoria never grew. Her marriage, nine pregnancies and a lifetime s overeating inexorably took their toll on her figure, which spread ever outwards rather than upwards as she aged, thus making her appear even shorter. Victoria s lack of height always frustrated her   she was once heard to exclaim in frustration:  Everyone grows but me!

As the young Victoria grew older her fair hair became darker and mousier and straighter, and although she had a very good complexion, her intolerance of heat caused her face to flush. Her mouth was rather thin and rabbity, and, when she smiled the princess displayed small, short teeth  like those of a mouse , according to Princess Marie of Romania. Victoria s half-sister, Feodora, noted her habit of keeping her mouth always a little open and advised her to try hard to keep it closed, though another commentator noted that her mouth, when closed, was  vacant and inexpressive .

(Photo by Getty Images) There is definitely a genuine prettiness in the early portraits of Queen Victoria, but one could never describe her as conventionally beautiful   except perhaps in that famous image of her gazing up adoringly at her husband, Prince Albert, on their wedding day. Victoria shared a likeness with her male German ancestors in some of her facial features   the slightly hooked Coburg nose, and the receding Hanoverian chin were features passed down to several of her children; the queen particularly lamented the latter in her son, Bertie, prince of Wales. It is a great shame that almost all official images of Queen Victoria are with a neutral, if not po-faced expression, for she in fact had a lovely smile.  When animated and smiling, the expression is pleasing in the extreme,  wrote one observer:  her whole face laughs . Thomas Sully s portrait was thought to be the closest to the queen s real character, which was  always best seized at a moment of animation . But that elusive smile would not be captured by a photographer until much later in her life. What did Queen Victoria's voice sound like? Queen Victoria is said to have had a lovely, pealing laugh, as well as a habit of shrugging her shoulders when she did so. Her voice   both spoken and when singing   was universally admired for its sweet, bell-like tones. Her self-confident delivery in public was noticed from her very first Privy Council meeting, held soon after her accession in 1837. At her first state opening of parliament later that year, the queen s voice was, according to Sallie Stevenson, the wife of the American ambassador,  sweet as a Virginia nightingale s . sweet, yet soft; powerful, yet melodious . American artist Thomas Sully echoed these sentiments:  I should be gratified if I were able to give an idea of the sweet tone of voice, and gentle manner of Queen Victoria! It was impressive of dignity and mildness, and at the same time I felt quite at my ease, as tho in company with merely a well bred lady.  A photograph by Roger Fenton of Queen Victoria, c1856. (Photo by Getty Images) The actress Fanny Kemble considered the young queen s voice to be  exquisite ; she had, she said,  not heard any spoken words more musical . And the voice lost none of its attractiveness in old age; in the 1890s the actress Ellen Terry waxed poetic, remarking that it sounded  like a silver stream flowing over golden stones . It is a shame therefore that a tiny fragment of a recording of Victoria s voice, made at Balmoral on a treadle-powered Bell-Tainter Graphophone in 1888 is too fleeting and scratchy for us to be able to catch any sense of it; a later recording made in 1898 was apparently destroyed.

Victoria was brought up in relative seclusion by her German mother, Victoire, Duchess of Kent, and German governess, Baroness Lehzen, and the three of them spoke their native language for most of the time. Until she was about 12 years of age Victoria s tutors were mostly German and so it is unsurprising that a report on her education in early 1831 confirmed that she  speaks English with a German accent . However, with the prospect of her becoming a future queen of Great Britain, it is likely that some of that accent was trained out of her by elocution lessons.

(Photo by Kean Collection/Getty Images) When married, Victoria and Prince Albert conversed among themselves and with many of their foreign relatives in German, and they were often heard quarrelling in German too. However, it would seem that although, as she grew older, the queen had no overt accent, she had a slight German lilt to her voice that even rubbed off on her children, particularly Bertie. Victoria s conversational speech and letters were larded with German words and turns of phrase. She is said to have had the habit of using the German interjection  so , pronounced as  tzo , and accentuating the  sh  sound German-style as  sch . Victoria s pronunciation of  Shocking!  when outraged, apparently had a particularly Germanic ring to it. Queen Victoria with her husband, Prince Albert, c1854. (Photo by   Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) The queen s poise While Victoria was by no means conventionally beautiful, and indeed at first glance she appeared quite unprepossessing because of her lack of height, she had tremendous presence   as was noted by many people. Her presence made her seem taller than she was; as an 1846 American visitor noted:  her admirable gait, and the absence of that  tip-toe  carriage usually observable in short persons, redeem her from insignificance.  Queen Victoria also had tremendous poise, as Thomas Sully noticed. She had the ability to make a whole room stand still when she entered and it was a queenliness unique to her, described by Princess Lieven as  an aplomb, an air of command and dignity . Such was Victoria s grace of movement that she had an extraordinary ability to glide across a room, as historian Thomas Carlyle noted when they met in 1869. The queen, he said, had  sailed out towards [him] as if moving on skates . Such lightness on her feet had perhaps been acquired through her youthful enthusiasm for dancing, and Victoria remained a nimble dancer well into old age. Do TV and films show us the real Victoria? There have been many attempts to capture Queen Victoria in film and television right from the beginning of the silent film era. Aside from Anna Neagle in the 1930s on film, one of the first memorable TV Victorias was that by Annette Crosbie in the 1975 ITV series Edward the Seventh. Rosemary Leach and Sheila Reed also took on the role of the older queen on TV in the 1970s. But it is undoubtedly the Judi Dench version in the popular 1997 film Mrs Brown, and her 2017 reprise of the role in Victoria and Abdul, that stick in our minds. Dench s highly plausible and down-to-earth interpretation set a benchmark for the older queen that it is doubtful anyone will ever match. Read more | Queen Victoria on screen As for the younger queen: in 2001 Victoria Hamilton (who has since played the Queen Mother in The Crown) delivered an excellent, realistic interpretation in BBC TV s Victoria and Albert. Emily Blunt s spirited performance in the feature-film Young Victoria (2009), while engaging and accomplished, presented us with a far taller and prettier version of the original. And this remains the problem with all portrayals of the young Queen Victoria. There is no doubt that the lovely and vivacious Jenna Coleman has now indelibly set her stamp on the role through three series of the ITV series Victoria. In the first series in particular Colman showed us a side of the queen s headstrong and impetuous personality with all its foibles and shortcomings that had not been fully explored before on TV. She has since grown into the role with considerable skill and authority. But is she the real Victoria? Jenna Coleman in ITV's 'Victoria'.

For all our wishful thinking, the years of romantic love were all too brief for the real Queen Victoria, who grew plainer and dumpier with every pregnancy. Widowhood at the age of 42 aged Victoria prematurely. The beautiful blue eyes became increasingly bulgy, the mouth more decidedly turned down, and the chin disappeared into fleshy jowls   contributing to an image of Victoria as a stony-faced and humourless matriarch. This does her a great disservice but sadly it remains the prevailing sense that we have of her. Queen Victoria aged 53. (Photo by   Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) Sadly, too, no images of the queen that have come down to us truly convey the immediacy and force of her commanding personality   had we ever been in a room with her. It is that power; that instinctive queenliness that made, and still makes, Queen Victoria so compelling. It is a quality that transcends beauty and the many romanticised film and TV versions of her.

        "content": "After the sudden and tragic death of Prince Albert in 1861, the grief-stricken Queen Victoria dedicated herself to memorialising her marriage as a perfect union. She herself composed large parts of the first biography, The Early Years of the Prince Consort (1867). At Frogmore, the royal burial ground at Windsor, she built a mausoleum and commissioned the sculptor Marochetti to create effigies of herself and the prince lying side-by-side   though it would be another 40 years before she would take her place beside her beloved Albert. Thanks, in part, to the queen s efforts, her marriage to Albert, prince of the German duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, came to be seen as one of the great love matches of all time, celebrated (with varying degrees of accuracy) in films such as The Young Victoria and, more recently, the ITV drama Victoria. Ad As Queen Victoria s journal shows, from the moment she saw the prince arriving at the foot of the staircase at Windsor in 1839, she was smitten. Five days later she summoned him to her blue closet and proposed to him. But the marriage was not the romantic happy-ever-after story that Victoria constructed. It was far more complex than that. Why did Victoria and Albert marry? Like all dynastic marriages, this was an alliance with a political agenda. As the second son of a minor German duke (Coburg is smaller than the Isle of Wight) and a mere Serene Highness, the lowest grade in the royal hierarchy, Prince Albert was Victoria s poor relation, although the two were first cousins. But what he lacked in rank and wealth, he made up for with education and self-confidence, and he had been trained from his teens by King Leopold of Belgium, the cousins  mutual uncle, to marry Victoria and take over the British throne. Listen to a recorded version of this article: Albert began his quest for power immediately after the marriage. Within months he had moved his writing desk next to the queen s. At first, Victoria resisted Albert s attempts to remove her trusted governess, Baroness Lehzen, from control of the court. But as one pregnancy followed another in quick succession   seven of Victoria s nine children were born in the first 10 years of the marriage   the queen was in no condition to resist. Albert fired Lehzen and assumed control of the household, introducing much-needed reforms and economies. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in a re-enactment of their marriage ceremony, 1854.

In November 1840, when her first child was born, Victoria gave Albert the key to the cabinet boxes. He started to attend meetings with ministers, dealing with the queen s correspondence and drafting business letters for the queen to copy out. At dinners with politicians, Albert could be heard prompting Victoria in German before she spoke. By now he had become her private secretary. In 1850 he described his position thus:  As the natural head of [the queen s] family, superintendent of her household, manager of her private affairs, sole confidential adviser in politics, and only assistant in her communications with the officers of her government, he is, besides, the husband of the queen, the tutor of the royal children, the private secretary of the sovereign, and her permanent minister.  Not only was Albert king in all but name but he intervened in politics, pursuing an active role in foreign policy.

Watch all episodes now In this five-part series, historian Tracy Borman charts the changing fortunes of the monarchy, from the bloody Norman conquest of 1066 through the upheaval of civil war in the 17th century to the reign of Elizabeth II. Victoria declared herself grateful to Albert for relieving her of the tiresome work of the sovereign. Women, she believed, were not fit to rule.  It is a reversal of the right order of things which distresses me much and which no one, but such a perfection, such an angel as he is   could bear and carry through.  But Victoria had a vein of steel, and her commitment to her birthright was absolute. She was torn between her passionate desire to be a perfect  Victorian  wife to Albert   an angel in the house, all sweetness and light   and her Hanoverian inheritance. How did Prince Albert craft the image of their marriage? The image of the Victorian monarchy, crafted by Albert, and projected in paintings such as Winterhalter s The Royal Family in 1846 was one of a child-centred bourgeois family on the throne. But the fact was that the royal marriage was unlike any other. It took place within the peculiar context of the court. As a young maid of honour in Victoria s court in the 1850s, Mary Bulteel would watch the door silently close on the queen s private apartments. How she longed to get to know the queen, her employer, but Victoria barely spoke to her. The withdrawal of the royal family from the public space of the court into the private apartments was Albert s doing. It meant that Victoria s life was no longer bounded by the court, as it had been in the early days of her reign, when her court was a Camelot, famed for its parties and youthful high spirits. The creation of a private sphere   of a space dedicated to domestic life   was one of the most far-reaching changes made by Albert in his drive to reform the monarchy. Disliking London with its late nights, and sneered at by the aristocracy as a German beggar, Albert persuaded Victoria that her enjoyment of society was wrong. True happiness, he claimed, was to be found in the country with her beloved prince and her young family. Albert designed the new family home at Osborne on the Isle of Wight, safely inaccessible from a prying public. Even more remote was Balmoral, the castle he created in the Scottish Highlands, 500 miles from London. At Osborne House or Balmoral, the family could live the simple outdoors life that Victoria later depicted in her Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands. Victoria believed her  happy domestic home  made her more popular than any other sovereign and gave a good example to her subjects. At court, Albert introduced new rules, distancing the royal family from the household   that is, the courtiers and officeholders such as the Lord Chamberlain. He ordered that no man was to sit in the presence of the queen. Throughout Victoria s reign, prime ministers stood during audiences; only two were accorded the special privilege of sitting in the queen s presence   her favourite Disraeli, who declined the offer, and Lord Salisbury, who was too heavy to stand. The hated Gladstone was never asked to sit, even in his eighties. At court, Albert introduced new rules, distancing the royal family from the household Albert forbade maids of honour from sitting in his presence or speaking to him unless spoken to. He went everywhere attended by an equerry, thus emphasising his royal status. In his relations with the courtiers of the household, Albert was cold and stiff.  His way of giving orders and reproofs was rather too like a master of a house scolding servants to be pleasant for those who were bound to listen in silence,  wrote Mary Bulteel. People noticed that the prince made not a single friend among ministers or the household. Such reserve in so young a man was  unpleasant , thought Mary:  It implied something of the cold egotism which seems to chill you in all royalties.  Memoirs of ladies-in-waiting concur that Albert was  detested  because he was  so stiff , especially with women. Victoria, on the other hand, was adored because of her disarming frankness and her unquenchable curiosity and interest in the affairs of everyone around her. Albert s cold manner derived in part from his upbringing at the small German court of Coburg. When Mary Bulteel visited Coburg in 1860, she found the court far stiffer than in Britain, and the equerries and household much more  collapsed before these little sovereigns than we are before the queen . One result of withdrawing from the court was that the royal couple were closer to their ordinary servants than they were to the aristocratic courtiers of the household. This is perhaps why, after Albert s death, Victoria became intimate first with her Highland servant John Brown, and later with her Indian servant Abdul Karim   relationships that the courtiers found especially upsetting because they overturned the protocol of the court.

Behind the closed doors of the private apartments, Victoria was often irritable and moody. She bitterly resented what she called  the shadow side of marriage , meaning pregnancy and childbirth, and she suffered from postnatal depression. She disliked babies, who she thought were  mere little plants for the first six months  and  frightful when undressed  with their  big body and little limbs and that terrible frog-like action . Victoria s  nerves  became worse during the 1850s. Her last two pregnancies were marked by hysterical scenes. Albert was advised by the royal doctors that the queen s mood swings and violent Hanoverian tempers were symptoms that she had inherited the madness of her grandfather George III. Rather than engage, he walked away and, as his wife stormed out of the room in a fury, the prince composed letters reprimanding her for unreasonable behaviour.  If you are violent I have no other choice but to leave you  and retire to my room in order to give you time to recover yourself, then you follow me to renew the dispute and have it all out,  he wrote. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, five years after their marriage. (Photo by Roger Fenton/Roger Fenton/Getty Images) Victoria kept a notebook in which she recorded her tempers, her selfishness, and her loss of self-control. Albert would read her confessions and issue her with a  certificate  of improvement, reviewing her behaviour as he might a child. Albert s intentions were no doubt good. He was certainly a loyal and faithful husband. Victoria s adoration of her beloved was undimmed. But she was made to feel that she was inadequate, his intellectual and moral inferior.  I owe everything to dearest papa,  she told her daughter.  He was my father, my protector, my guide and adviser in all and everything, my mother (I might almost say) as well as my husband.  This was not a marriage of equals. It was as if the only way the couple could live with the anomaly (as they saw it) of Victoria being a woman on the throne and superior in rank to her husband was by making her feel that she was Albert s inferior in every other respect. This artifice imposed unbearable stresses upon them both. Little wonder Victoria lost her temper now and then. Albert s reaction was to escape into work. In the 1850s he consistently rose early in the morning to deal with his growing amount of paperwork. His meddling in politics made him unpopular in the country, and he became a lonely, unhappy figure. Photographs show him prematurely aged, balding and careworn. Queen Victoria s tragedy was that Albert s death, aged 42, meant that these tensions were never resolved.

        "content": "Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert, were passionate lovers with a mutual physical attraction but with seemingly no understanding of family planning. The result was nine children born between 1840 and 1857. Albert, intelligent and ambitious, was determined to put this burgeoning brood to good use. He and Victoria were united in the desire that they should not just be a model, loving and happy family, but that they would also set a moral example that would redefine royalty and be the foundation of a dynasty that would stretch across Europe, bringing peace and harmony to the fractious continent. Ad It was a noble plan, motivated by the highest ideals, and one that was to lead to the creation of the modern idea of the royal family so familiar to us today. But like so many of the best-laid plans, human nature got in the way. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert surrounded by some of their children at Windsor Castle.

(GL Archive/Alamy Stock Photo) It was Albert, the intellectual, who was responsible for shaping and modernising the royal family in the 19th century; his influence would last well into the next. From the moment of his marriage to Victoria in 1840 to his untimely death 21 years later, he saw his purpose as protecting and nourishing the British monarchy at a time when political turmoil threatened at home and revolution was sweeping Europe. Albert believed that in order to survive and prosper, royalty should be presented as a respectable and close- knit, loving family. As the historian Miranda Carter says:  It s as if Albert and Victoria are trying to reach out to their middle class subjects and say,  look, we are like you, trust us .  But of course the royal family was not like the middle class. It existed in the enclosed bubble of the court where tensions and hostilities festered and where children were fawned over and flattered from the moment they were born. Yet at the same time these youngsters were expected to be model children, utterly obedient to their parents. It was an intolerable tension. Troubled childhoods A fraught family life was perhaps unsurprising, given the couple s own experiences. They were both the product of unhappy childhoods. Albert s upbringing in Germany had been overshadowed by the breakdown of his parents  marriage. His father, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfield (and then, from 1826, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) was a serial philanderer who paid little attention to his son. Albert grew up longing for his father s love while detesting his behaviour. He was determined when the time came to be a model father and everything that his father was not. But when he became a parent the problem was that he had no example to follow. Victoria, too, had much to react against. She had grown up secluded at Kensington Palace under the control of her domineering mother, the Duchess of Kent. Later she admitted, revealingly,  I had led a very unhappy life as a child   had no scope for my very violent feelings of affection  and did not know what a happy domestic life was . Queen Victoria depicted aged four. Victoria spoke of having had an unhappy childhood. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) The couple, deeply in love and physically well suited, were united in the wish to create a family that would serve not just as an escape from their own unhappy pasts, but also as a pan-European dynasty and a model for a nation. Unsurprisingly, given the couple s physical infatuation, their first child, Princess Victoria, called Vicky, was born nine months after their wedding. The queen was busy with her duties as monarch and could spare little time for her baby, seeing her only twice a day. Within a year of Vicky s birth Albert Edward, known as Bertie   the future King Edward VII   was born. The queen now had a healthy male heir.  Our little boy is a wonderfully strong and large child,  she wrote proudly.  I hope and pray he may be like his dearest Papa.  With the succession reasonably assured, it might be thought a rest from the risk of childbearing would be appropriate. Not so. Over the next five years another three children were born: Alice, Alfred and Helena. While Queen Victoria gave birth to many children, she hated being pregnant, and historians have suggested that she may have suffered from post-natal depression. She compared pregnancy to feeling like a cow and wrote that  an ugly baby is a very nasty object   and the prettiest is frightful when undressed . Nor did Victoria necessarily like babies.  An ugly baby is a very nasty object,  she protested,  the prettiest are frightful when undressed  as long as they have their big body and little limbs and that terrible froglike action . Nor could she contemplate breastfeeding them, finding the whole process repulsive. A wet nurse was therefore employed for all her children, as Victoria devoted herself to Albert. The result was four more children: Louise, Arthur, Leopold and Beatrice. Victoria had nine babies over 17 years   a tremendous physical feat, and a dangerous one given the high rates of maternal mortality at the time.

(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The model family The royal couple set to work putting their plan for a model family into action. It was essential for them also that they were seen to be doing so. With the birth of mass communication, Albert well understood the need for the public to be made aware of the ideal for which they were striving. Under the Hanoverians the monarchy had fallen into disrepute, torn apart by feuding and scandal. Now, in countless paintings and photographs, Victoria and Albert were shown in harmonious family group portraits. Today they are a lovely record, if not a strictly true one, of the development of the royal family. The publicity worked and Victoria was delighted:  They say no Sovereign was ever more loved than I (I am bold enough to say), and this because of our happy domestic home and the good example it presents . In a reversal of the typical roles of the time, Victoria devoted herself to regal duties while Albert took responsibility for the upbringing of the children. He was a new type of father, ahead of his time, with a hands-on approach to child rearing. From the beginning his relationship with his first child, Vicky, went well. Lady Lyttleton, a governess, remembered seeing him playing with her:  Albert tossed and romped with her, making her laugh and crow and kick heartily . Victoria, by contrast, was far more distant and guarded. She looked on as Albert took control of all aspects of the children s development. At first Albert found this task fulfilling and stimulating, appealing to his sense of himself as an expert in human behaviour:  There is certainly a great charm, as well as deep interest, in watching the development of feelings and faculties in a little child,  he once remarked. Prince Albert with Princess Victoria and Eos, c1843. (Photo by English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images) An education Albert was the product of an intensive German education that had made him into an accomplished polymath. He expected the same of his children   and more. He developed a punishing educational programme to create the model prince or princess that took little account of the abilities of an average intellect. According to Baron Stockmar, his advisor, the regime would give any child brain fever. The plan began when the children were infants, with the instilling of discipline.  The chief objects here,  the prince opined,  are their physical development, the actual rearing up, the training to obedience . Corporal punishment was at the heart of this training. The children frequently received  a real punishment by whipping  if they stepped out of line and Albert himself would hit his children s fingers during piano lessons when they played the wrong notes. There was instruction, too, in manners and, as the children grew older, lessons in the languages of the courts of Europe, especially German and French. On top of this there was tuition in Latin, geography, maths and science. The education would have been tough even for the most able child, but for the mostly very average young princes and princesses it was purgatory. Fortunately Vicky, the eldest child, was extremely bright and the strict regime got off to a good start. She began her French lessons at the tender age of 18 months; soon she was speaking Latin and reading Shakespeare. Naturally, given her parents  heritage, she was also fluent in German. The queen fully backed her husband s plan. She idolised him to the children, telling them  none of you can ever be proud enough of being the child of such a father who has not his equal in this world . It followed that she would want them, especially the boys, to be brought up as mini-replicas of the man she adored so ardently. She prayed that her baby Bertie would grow up to  resemble his angelic dearest Father in every, every respect, both in body and mind . Of course, life being what it is, the heir to the throne turned out in every respect to be the opposite of his father. His parents believed he could be a blank slate on which they could draw a perfect little Albert   they were utterly wrong. From an early age Bertie obstinately refused to conform to his father s plan for the royal children s education. Here was no renaissance prince in the making: despite being stuffed with facts and theory he found learning difficult and was unable to concentrate. The intense pressure on the backward young prince produced a negative reaction. His tutor Frederick Gibbs remembered the frequent schoolroom tantrums during arithmetic lessons with the Prince of Wales:  He became passionate, the pencil was flung to the end of the room, the stool was kicked away and he was hardly able to apply himself at all . Albert s plan for the heir to the throne of the greatest empire the world had ever seen turned out a complete failure. Instead of the longed for polymath his son turned out to be a dunce. Victoria complained about his  systematic idleness, laziness   disregard of everything . The worried parents consulted a phrenologist, a modish quack who claimed the shape of the head affected the brain. His diagnosis confirmed everything they feared:  The feeble quality of the brain will render the Prince highly excitable  intellectual organs are only moderately well developed. The result will be strong self-will, at times obstinacy . Queen Victoria's son Albert Edward, Prince of Wales   the future King Edward VII   in 1870. (Photo by J Russell & Sons/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The Prince of Wales was not the only one of the nine children who played up and refused to conform to Albert s plan for a perfect royal development. As each grew up, he or she displayed the quirks and characteristics of individual human nature. Albert was perplexed and dismayed and he came to suspect that his children were suffering from their Stuart inheritance   certainly they could not have inherited their frailties and foibles from his princely blood! But the plan had to go on. Royal marriages As time passed, eight of the children were married off to European princes and princesses, in order that a pan-European dynasty be created. First to go was Princess Victoria, the eldest, to Fritz of Prussia. Both parents were devastated to lose their 17-year-old, especially Albert who wrote  the pang of parting was great on all sides, and the void which Vicky has left in our household and family circle will stand gaping for many a day . But dynastic duty had to override human feeling, and his favourite daughter was taken away to a new and bewildering life in the Prussian court. Princess Beatrice, the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria, who married Prince Henry of Battenberg in 1885. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The pressure on Albert to carry out all his many royal duties and to bring up the family according to his plan was immense. He found his work exhausting. In 1860 he compared himself to a donkey on a treadmill, complaining:  He, too, would rather munch thistles in the castle moat. Small are the thanks he gets for his labour . Victoria, ever self-centred and emotional, came to resent the attention he paid to the children. There were frequent outbursts and marital rows. The strain took its toll on the Prince Consort s health. He suffered toothache, insomnia and fits of shivering. The doctors were mystified, unable to make a proper diagnosis. Victoria failed to empathise with her husband. In one of her many letters to her daughter Vicky, she wrote:  Dear Papa never allows he is any better or will try to get over it, but makes such a miserable face that people always think he is very ill . Albert soldiered on, desperate to realise his vision for the royal family. In 1860 he arranged the key dynastic marriage of the Prince of Wales to Princess Alexandra of Denmark. In a changing world it was crucial that this be portrayed both as a worthwhile diplomatic alliance (which it was), and a love match. The Victorian public, in an era of pious rectitude, demanded a pure marriage in which the heir to the throne appeared to be virtuous and chaste. The Prince of Wales, however, was anything but chaste. His life from an early age was devoted to pleasure, much to his parent s desperate alarm. In the summer of 1861 Bertie attended a training camp with Grenadier Guards in Dublin. His fellow officers arranged for a  lady of easy virtue  to join him for the night. The story of the prince s trysts got back to his parents and provoked in Albert a furious, almost hysterical, response. How could his son, he demanded,  thrust yourself into the hands of one of the most abject of the human species, to be by her initiated in the sacred mysteries of creation? . Everything that Albert had been working for seemed threatened. He warned Bertie that  you must not, you dare not be lost; the consequences for this country and the world at large would be too dreadful . A tragic death Albert s plan for perfect children seemed to have failed utterly. Sickening and feverish, Albert travelled to meet the Prince of Wales at Cambridge to harangue him on the error of his ways. Father and son went for a long walk in the rain. Bertie apologised, Albert forgave and then returned to Windsor wet through, racked with pain in his legs and suffering from fever. He retired to bed, where his symptoms worsened. In December 1861, aged only 42, he died. Queen Victoria s grief was so great that it would dominate her family and the nation for decades to come. And of course she blamed her eldest son Bertie for her beloved s death. For years she could hardly bear to bring herself even to look at him. Queen Victoria at Balmoral with her daughters Princess Alice and Princess Louise and a portrait of her late husband, Prince Albert. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) With Albert s death the idea of raising perfect children died too. Victoria managed as best she could, relying on her position as queen and her domineering character to make her children bend to her will. In this she was generally successful, though she and the Prince of Wales gave each other a wide berth. And her many letters show she was   if a mixture of egocentric martinet and self-pitying widow   always at heart a loving mother. Like all parents before and after, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert learned that children have an extraordinary ability to perplex, frustrate and amaze at their individuality and their obstinate refusal to turn into little paragons. Years later Victoria was honest enough to say this herself in a surprising yet characteristic admission:  You will find as your children grow up that as a rule your children are a bitter disappointment   their greatest object being to do precisely what their parents do not wish and have anxiously tried to prevent . The great matriarch concluded with an eternal truth that it had taken her years to come to appreciate that  often when children have been less watched and less taken care of   the better they turn out! This is inexplicable and very annoying! . Certainly her own children, in the main, turned out well enough despite the untimely death of their father and the failure of his plan. Even Bertie, a libertine and prince of pleasure, was as Edward VII a very successful king whose easy charm and diplomatic skills ensured the continuing popularity of the British royal family and brought Britain closer to France on the eve of the catastrophe of the First World War. In a surprising and all too human way, Albert s plan had worked out after all. Denys Blakeway is a documentary producer and writer.

        "content": "Overlooking Bruges  market square and a few hundred metres away from the neo-Gothic Provincial Palace stands a popular chain hotel, providing accommodation for some of the millions of tourists that visit the Belgian city each year. Ad Looking at this unremarkable redbrick building, it s hard to imagine that on the same site, an important place of worship once towered over this historic metropolis: the medieval St Donatian s Church. And a new detail that has emerged from the archives of the church leads us to consider something even harder to imagine: could the crown of England s last Anglo-Saxon king, Harold Godwinson, have been sold to pay for its upkeep? A church of sanctuary and sacrilege St Donatian s church   named after the fourth-century French saint, Donatian   was established around AD 950 by Arnulf I, the count of Flanders. Prior to its destruction during the French Revolutionary Wars, the church was a college of canons, built to hold relics of St Donatian brought to Bruges from Torhout (a municipality in West Flanders) in around 870. An illustration of St Donatian's in Flandria Illustrata, 1641 (Public domain) Today, the church is best-known for being the scene of the brutal murder of another Flemish count, Charles the Good, who was attacked by a group of knights in 1127. Lesser-known, however, is the fact that the place of worship also played a significant role in the exile of Lady Gunhild   sister of the last Anglo-Saxon king, Harold Godwinson. The church became Gunhild s final resting place, and recent research by Elisabeth van Houts, emeritus honorary professor of medieval history at the University of Cambridge, suggests that it may have greatly benefited from the spoils of the Norman Conquest. A family in exile It is one of the most famous tales in English history, detailed on the Bayeux Tapestry and depicted in BBC drama King and Conqueror: William of Normandy s defeat of Harold Godwinson at the battle of Hastings. It fundamentally changed England s political and social landscape, bringing with it a new language, new power structures and the eventual creation of the first national survey, Domesday Book. Domesday Book, the first national survey and only contemporary document to discuss Gunhild (Image by Alamy) Harold was killed in the fighting, as was his brother, Tostig Godwinson, at the preceding battle of Stamford Bridge. But what happened to Harold s surviving family after the Norman Conquest? The dramatic events of 1066 didn t just end the Anglo-Saxon era and Harold s life   they scattered his relatives across Europe. The king s sister, Gunhild, and their mother, Gytha, fled England for Saint-Omer in Flanders, with Gunhild later moving on to Bruges. In 1786, almost 700 years after her death, the tomb of Gunhild was uncovered in St Donatian s Church. Her tomb included a burial plaque alongside a long Latin obituary detailing her life in exile. Such details reveal that Gunhild lived a pious and simple existence in Bruges, where  she was abstained from all pleasures  and  did not eat anything that seemed sweet to her but instead took only enough to stay alive . From this description, you would be forgiven for thinking that Gunhild lived in poverty, but in reality, she was still extremely wealthy. Indeed, the only contemporary document to discuss Gunhild, Domesday Book, reveals her vast riches, indicating that she  held the income of four manors, one in Sussex and three in Somerset, comprising approximately 30 hides, giving her an annual income of just under  30 . A Bayeux Tapestry scene depicts the famous Battle of Hastings defeat of King Harold (Public domain) Much of this wealth would have been confiscated and redistributed by the Norman invaders, but Gunhild once again came into money upon her mother s death. According to Elisabeth van Houts,  we can get some idea of [the size of Gunhild s wealth] from the archive of St Donatian, which in the 14th century kept records of her bequest of gold and silver to the canons . Read more | How well did Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror know each other prior to the battle of Hastings? Given that the bequest was still being written about some 300 years after Gunhild s death suggests that it was clearly of great importance. So much so, in fact, that the canons of the late 11th century had even buried Gunhild in the church as a sign of their gratitude. Relic in the roof? So   why were the canons so thankful for this bequest in particular? Van Houts  research suggests that some of the gifts were no less than crown jewels. According to records from 1389,  the sale of certa jocalia ( certain jewels  or  precious objects ) given by Lady Gunhild for the repair of the church s roof, vault and choir  were approved by the Bishop of Tournai. Antonius Schoonhoven   a canon of St Donatian s   concluded that in Gunhild s bequests, there  were among others an imperial crown (corona augustalis) and many works of the best authors richly ornamented . In other words, the crown of Gunhild s brother, Harold, may well have been bequeathed to the canons of St Donatian s before being sold to fund vital works on the church. A 13th-century manuscript illustration shows Harold Godwinson being crowned as King of England, a pivotal moment in English history (Image by Alamy) We may never know the truth of the matter, but as Van Houts points out,  monastic houses acted as banks providing loans and mortgages from the 11th century  [and] the canons of St Donatian at Bruges would have expected to receive charitable donations from the English noblewomen . Therefore, it is possible that Gunhild gifted the canons these precious possessions not merely as a sign of gratitude, but because she was expected to do so. Yet even if we don t know the exact circumstances, the items would have likely been of huge personal value to Gunhild   both financially and emotionally. Historians have long speculated on what happened to Harold s crown after the battle of Hastings, and there are no known confirmed records of its whereabouts beyond 1066. However, this insight into Gunhild s fate after 1066 raises the tantalising possibility that it might have ended up with her in Bruges, rather than finding its way into the hands of the Normans.

        "title": "The truth about Viking berserkers",
        "content": "There were few established military institutions in Scandinavia at the start of the Viking Age, circa 800, but a number of such organisations gradually developed as society came increasingly under the rule of a single king. The foremost institution was the retinue, a brotherhood of warriors serving a common master. It developed to become the main source of power for the medieval kings and evolved into a noble elite in the Middle Ages. Ad But there was a more sinister brotherhood of warriors in Scandinavia that could not find any place in the post-heathen world of Christianity. Instead it only survived in the realm of the sagas, the art and the folklore, often becoming shield-biting demons of war and symbols of evildoing. But behind the myth and the shroud of history, the sources reveal the existence of men thriving on the border between life and death, fuelled by war and distinguished by their ecstatic battle fury. The description of  berserkers  and  wolfskins  in the sources is on the boundary between fantasy and reality, and it is difficult for us today to imagine that such people can have ever existed, possessed of incontrollable destructive power. But they did. The berserkers and the wolfskins (also known as  heathen wolves ) were a special group of very skilled and dangerous warriors associated with the god Odin. Vikings: Valhalla   the real history behind Netflix's successor to Vikings Netflix's Vikings: Valhalla brings a new generation of Viking schemers and dreamers to the screen, from explorers Leif Erikson and Freyd s Eir ksd ttir to warrior Harald Sigurdsson and empire-builder King Cnut. Here s what s what to expect from the show, plus the real history that underpins the story How might berserkers have fought in wars? If there were elite troops such as berserkers and wolfskins available on the battlefield, they were put in the front of the phalanx [a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely of heavy infantry] to resist the main weight of an attack, or at the front when launching an attack. But berserker troops could be a double-edged sword, as they were difficult to control in a battle and were often ill-suited to formation warfare. Instead, they seem to prefer to operate in smaller groups, attacking independently. Olav Haraldsson (St Olav) put the berserkers in front of his own phalanx at the battle of Stiklestad in the year 1030, but instead of holding the line they attacked and thereby contributed to the king s downfall. This marginal illumination from the Saga of Saint Olaf shows his death at the battle of Stiklestad in 1030. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) Viking warriors looked to the god Odin to give them aggression and courage in battle, but the berserkers took this a step further. According to the sources they could rout an outnumbering force, and when they attacked they howled like mad dogs or wolves. It was said that neither iron nor fire could injure them, and they didn t know pain. After a battle they were as weak as infants, totally spent both physically and psychologically. It is difficult to find any clear difference between a berserker and a wolfskin. Sometimes they appear to be the same, under the general description of berserker, and at other times they are portrayed as two different types of warrior. In some contexts, the wolfskins are even more closely connected with the Odin cult than the berserkers seem to be. A brotherhood of war Originally berserkers developed their own brotherhood of professional warriors who travelled round and took service with different chiefs. What distinguished them was that they had bears and wolves as totem animals, and clad themselves in their skins. Irrespective of whether it was a bear or a wolf, the warriors believed they were endowed with the spirit of the animal. Designs showing warriors clad in what could be bearskins occur, among other places, on the Torslund plates from  land, thought to date from the seventh century. In the Fornalder sagas ( Sagas of Earlier Times ) and in several other sagas, the king s or the chieftain s guard is described as made up of berserkers, usually 12 in number. The berserkers often comprised an elite troop in addition to the guard or the army in general. In sea battles they were usually stationed at the prow, to take the leading point of an attack. In the battle of Hafrsfjord, c872, they appear as shock troops for Harald H rfagre (Finehair), in groups of 12. The berserkers are spoken of as fearsome enemies to meet. They were often said to be so intoxicated by battle-lust that they bit their shields, attacked boulders and trees and even killed each other while they were waiting for battles to begin. A set of chessmen from the 12th century found on the Isle of Lewis in the Scottish Hebrides includes a chess piece of a warrior biting his shield. The title of berserker is thought sometimes to have been inherited from father to son, and there are known examples of entire families of berserkers. One such family known from the sagas is Egil Skallagrimson. Egil s father, Skallagrim ( ugly skull ), and his grandfather Kveldulv ( nightwolf ) were also berserkers. The concept of  berserk  also turns up independently of  berserker . The idea of  going berserk  could apply to more than just the members of a warrior brotherhood. Harald Hardr de (Hardruler)  went berserk  at the 1066 battle of Stamford Bridge, for example. The expression is also used in relation to warriors who are not thought to have been wearing any distinctive uniform of animal skins. Olav Haraldsson s berserkers, who wrecked the battle of Stiklestad for him, are an example of this. King Harold II, the Saxon king of Britain, beholds the body of his rebellious brother Tostig, whom he has just defeated at the battle of Stamford Bridge, 1066. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) What's the earliest evidence of berserkers? The earliest written sources of what might be berserkers are found in Roman writings from the first century AD. In his book Germania, the historian Tacitus describes correspondingly fantastic elite warriors among the German tribes in northern Europe. In the sixth century, the East Roman historian Prokopios wrote of  the wild and lawless heruli  from the north, describing how they went almost naked into battle, clad only in loincloths   this was to show disdain for their wounds. They wore neither helmet nor coat of mail, and used only a light shield to protect themselves. The people who were described as  heruli  probably had their origin on Sj land or Fyn in today s Denmark, but they can also be traced to other parts of Scandinavia, including Norway. The heruli are said to have had a kingdom on Fyn. This may have survived until into the sixth century, but more of them had previously been driven out of Scandinavia by the Danes. The heruli often took service as warrior bands in the Roman army. They appeared in the same way as the berserkers, in small groups in the service of chieftains or kings, and there is a possibility that the origins of the berserkers may be found among the mysterious heruli. The Vikings | A short course from HistoryExtra Academy Member exclusive | Join Professor Ryan Lavelle for our four-week course on the Vikings   from trading and exploring to daily life. Explore the course now The berserkers are often mentioned in sagas, skaldic poems [composed at the courts of Scandinavian and Icelandic leaders during the Viking and Middle Ages] and other literature from the Middle Ages. In the sagas, which were written in a Christian context, the memory of these warriors has been extended to become a label for those who stand out from the norms of society: thugs and freebooters, pirates and so on. In the earliest Icelandic compendium of law, Gr g s, it is said that a raging berserker can either be bound or condemned to exile. The oldest known written source about berserkers is Haraldskvadet, a 9th-century skaldic poem honouring King Harald, attributed to the skaldic poet Torbj rn Hornklove. Writing about the battle of Hafrsfjord [date unknown], he writes:  Berserkers roared where the battle raged, wolf-heathens howled and iron weapons trembled . Battle of Hafrsfjord. (World History Archive/Alamy Stock Photo) In Grette s Saga it is said of the warriors in that same battle:   such berserkers as were called wolf-heathens; they had wolf-coverings as mail  and iron didn t bite them; one of them  started roaring and bit the edge of his shield  and growled viciously . In the Volsung Saga, describing events in the sixth century, it is said that the berserkers were in Odin s lifeguard and that they  went without armour, were as mad as dogs and wolves, they bit their shields, were as strong as bears or oxen, they killed everybody, and neither fire nor iron bit them; this is called going berserk . The descriptions in the sagas of violent men and killers cannot all be linked to the berserkers, however. Distinctions are made, for example, between  berserkers  and  warriors,  and between  normal  killers and men who fought duels. And the Old Norse saga texts never call the berserkers mad or insane. They regard the berserkers as something more than just socially problematic and unusually aggressive. The sagas distinguish them from other men by ascribing to them a particular  nature  that made one both scornful and fearful of them at the same time. 'Going berserk': what's the mushroom theory? In 1784 a priest named  dmann started a theory that  going berserk  was the result of eating fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria). That explanation gradually became more popular, and remains so today.  dmann based his hypothesis on reports about Siberian shamans, but it is important to note that he had no personal observations of the effects of eating this type of mushroom. White agaric has also been suggested as a cause of the berserk fury, but considering how poisonous this is, it is quite unthinkable that it would be eaten. Eating agaric mushrooms can lead to depression and can make the user apathetic, in addition to its hallucinogenic effects. Berserkers are certainly never described as apathetic! Poisoning with the fungus Claviceps purpurea has also been suggested   it contains a compound used to synthesise the hallucinogen LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide). However, if mushrooms had been so important for the berserkers, they would surely have been mentioned in the sagas, which they are not. The most probable explanation for  going berserk  comes from psychiatry. The theory is that the groups of warriors, through ritual processes carried out before a battle (such as biting the edges of their shields), went into a self-induced hypnotic trance. In this dissociative state they lost conscious control of their actions, which are then directed subconsciously. People in this state seem remote, have little awareness of their surroundings and have reduced awareness of pain and increased muscle strength. Critical thinking and normal social inhibitions weaken, but the people affected are not unconscious. Fly Agaric mushroom. (Photo by Eye Ubiquitous/UIG via Getty Images) This condition of psychomotor automatism possibly resembles what in forensic psychiatry is described as  diminished responsibility . The condition is followed by a major emotional catharsis in the form of tiredness and exhaustion, sometimes followed by sleep. Researchers think that the short-term aim of the trance may have been to achieve an abreaction of strong aggressive, destructive and sadistic impulses in a socially defined role. The Old Norse social order and religion were able to accommodate this type of behaviour, and it is understandable that the phenomenon disappeared after the introduction of Christianity. A Christian society considered such rituals and actions as demonic and thought that they must have resulted from supernatural influences.

        "content": "In 793, terror descended on the coast of Northumbria as armed raiders attacked the defenceless monastery of St Cuthbert on Lindisfarne. The terrified monks watched helplessly as the invaders made off with a haul of treasure and a clutch of captives. It was the first recorded raid by the Vikings, seaborne pirates from Scandinavia who would prey on coastal communities in north-western Europe for more than two centuries during the Viking age and create for themselves a reputation as fierce and pitiless warriors. Ad That image was magnified by those who wrote about the Viking attacks   in other words, their victims. The Anglo-Saxon cleric Alcuin of York wrote dramatically of the Lindisfarne raid that the  church was spattered with the blood of the priests of God, despoiled of all its ornaments  given as a prey to pagan peoples  and subsequent (mainly Christian) writers and chroniclers lost few opportunities to demonise the (mainly pagan) Vikings. Vikings: Valhalla   the real history behind Netflix's successor to Vikings Netflix's Vikings: Valhalla brings a new generation of Viking schemers and dreamers to the screen, from explorers Leif Erikson and Freyd s Eir ksd ttir to warrior Harald Sigurdsson and empire-builder King Cnut. Here s what s what to expect from the show, plus the real history that underpins the story Yet, though they undeniably carried out very destructive and violent attacks, from small-scale raids against churches to major campaigns involving thousands of warriors, the Vikings formed part of a complex and often sophisticated Scandinavian culture. As well as raiders they were traders, reaching as far east as the rivers of Russia and the Caspian Sea; explorers, sending ships far across the Atlantic to land on the coastline of North America five centuries before Columbus; poets, composing verse and prose sagas of great power, and artists, creating works of astonishing beauty. The reputation of the Vikings simply as raiders and plunderers has long been established. Restoring their fame as traders, storytellers, explorers, missionaries, artists and rulers is long overdue... When and where did the Vikings come from? The Vikings originated in what is now Denmark, Norway and Sweden (although centuries before they became unified countries). Their homeland was overwhelmingly rural, with almost no towns. The vast majority earned a meagre living through agriculture, or along the coast, by fishing. Advances in shipping technology in the 7th and 8th centuries meant that boats were powered by sails rather than solely by oars. These were then added to vessels made of overlapping planks ( clinker-built ) to create longships, swift shallow-drafted boats that could navigate coastal and inland waters and land on beaches. Exactly what first compelled bands of men to follow their local chieftain across the North Sea in these longships is unclear. It may have been localised overpopulation, as plots became subdivided to the point where families could barely eke out a living; it may have been political instability, as chieftains fought for dominance; or it may have been news brought home by merchants of the riches to be found in trading settlements further west. Probably it was a combination of all three. But in 793 that first raiding party hit Lindisfarne and within a few years further Viking bands had struck Scotland (794), Ireland (795) and France (799). Their victims did not refer to them as Vikings. That name came later, becoming popularised by the 11th century and possibly deriving from the word vik, which in the Old Norse language the Vikings spoke means  bay  or  inlet . Instead they were called Dani ( Danes )   there was no sense at the time that this should refer only to the inhabitants of what we now call Denmark   pagani ( pagans ) or simply Normanni ( Northmen ). The remains of a Viking longship found at Gokstad in South Norway, c1920. (Photo by Rischgitz/Getty Images) When and where did the Viking begin to raid? At first the raids were small-scale affairs, a matter of a few boatloads of men who would return home once they had collected sufficient plunder or if the resistance they encountered was too strong. But in the 850s they began to overwinter in southern England, in Ireland and along the Seine in France, establishing bases from which they began to dominate inland areas. The raids reached a crescendo in the second half of the ninth century. In Ireland the Vikings established longphorts   fortified ports   including at Dublin, from which they dominated much of the eastern part of the island. In France they grew in strength as a divided Frankish kingdom fractured politically and in 885 a Viking army besieged and almost captured Paris. In Scotland they established an earldom in the Orkneys and overran the Shetlands and the Hebrides. And in England an enormous Viking host, the micel here ( great army ) arrived in 865. Led by a pair of warrior brothers, Halfdan and Ivar the Boneless, they picked off the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England one by one. First Northumbria, with its capital at York, fell to them in 866, then East Anglia, followed by the central English kingdom of Mercia. Finally, only Wessex, ruled by King Alfred, remained. A pious bookworm, Alfred had only become king because his three more martial older brothers had sickened or died in battle in previous Viking invasions. Listen | Thomas Williams explores the key events and legacies of the Viking era In early January 878 a section of the Great Army led by Guthrum crossed the frontier and caught Alfred by surprise at the royal estate at Chippenham. Alfred barely managed to escape and spent months skulking in the Somerset marshes at Athelney. It looked like the independence of Wessex   and that of England generally   might be at an end. But against the odds Alfred gathered a new army, defeated the Vikings at Edington and forced Guthrum to accept baptism as a Christian. For his achievement in saving his kingdom he became the only native English ruler to gain the nickname  the Great . Silver penny of King Alfred. (Photo by Museum of London/Heritage Images/Getty Images)For 80 years England was divided between the land controlled by the kings of Wessex in the south and south-west and a Viking-controlled area in the Midlands and the north. Viking kings ruled this region until the last of them, Erik Bloodaxe, was expelled and killed in 954 and the kings of Wessex became rulers of a united England. Even so, Viking (and especially Danish) customs long persisted there and traces of Scandinavian DNA can still be found in a region that for centuries was known as the Danelaw. By the mid-11th century united kingdoms had appeared in Denmark, Norway and Sweden and the raids had finally begun to subside. There was a final burst of activity in the early 11th century when royal-sponsored expeditions succeeded in conquering England again and placing Danish kings on the throne there (including, most notably, Canute, who ruled an empire in England, Denmark and Norway, but who almost certainly did not command the tide to go out, as a folk tale alleges). Vikings remained in control of large parts of Scotland (especially Orkney), an area around Dublin and Normandy in France (where in 911 King Charles the Simple had granted land to a Norwegian chieftain, Rollo, the ancestor of William the Conqueror). They also controlled a large part of modern Ukraine and Russia, where Swedish Vikings had penetrated in the ninth century and established states based around Novgorod and Kiev. Where did Vikings settle and live? This was not the full extent of the Viking world, however. The same maritime aggression that had caused them to plunder (and ultimately conquer) settled lands also led them to venture in search of unknown shores on which to settle. Vikings probably arrived in the Faroes in the eighth century and they used this as a stepping-stone to sail further west across the Atlantic. In the mid-ninth century a series of Viking voyages came across Iceland and in the year 872 colonists led by Ing lf Arnarson settled on the island. They established a unique society, fiercely independent and owing no formal allegiance to the kings of Norway. It was a republic whose supreme governing body was, from 930, the Althing, an assembly made up of Iceland s chief men which met each summer in a plain beside a massive cleft in a ring of hills in the centre of the island. It has a strong claim to be the world s oldest parliament. From Iceland, too, we have other vital pieces of evidence of the inventiveness of Viking societies. These include the earliest pieces of history written by Vikings themselves in the form of a 12th-century history of Iceland, the  slendingab k, and the Landn mab k, an account of the original settlement of the island (with the names of each of the first settlers and the land they took). But more important   and surprising for those who view of the Vikings is as one-dimensional warriors   is the collection of sagas known as the  slendingas gur or Icelandic Family Sagas. Their setting is the first 150 years of the Viking colony in Iceland and they tell of often-troubled relations between the main Icelandic families. Alliances, betrayals, feuds and murders play out against the backdrop of a landscape in which features can still often be identified today. At their best, in tales such as Nj l s Saga or Egil s Saga, they are powerful pieces of literature in their own right, and among the most important writing to survive from any European country in the Middle Ages. Who was the most famous Viking? Ivarr the Boneless   a famous warrior and one of the leaders of the  Great Heathen Army  that landed in East Anglia in 865, and that went on to conquer the kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia   was remembered as the founding father of the royal dynasty of the Viking kingdom of Dublin. It is not known how Ivar came by the nickname  the Boneless , although some have suggested it could have been due to an unnatural flexibility during combat or because he suffered from a degenerative muscular disorder, eventually resulting in him having to be carried everywhere. Unless his body is ever recovered   which would be difficult if he really was  boneless    we will never know. Other famous Vikings include Aud the Deep-Minded, Eirik Bloodaxe and Einar Buttered-Bread. Click here to read about the 8 most famous Vikings Vikings and religion: what gods did they believe in? Iceland was the location of another drama that highlights the transition of Viking societies away from warrior chieftainships. Christianity came later to Scandinavian Viking societies than to many other parts of Europe. Whereas France s kings had accepted Christianity by the early sixth century and the Anglo-Saxon kings of England largely in the seventh, Christian missionaries only appeared in southern Scandinavia in the ninth century and made little headway there until Harald Bluetooth of Denmark accepted baptism in around 960. Harald had become Christian after a typical piece of Viking theatre: a drunken argument around the feasting table as to which was more powerful   Norse gods Odin and Thor, or the new Christian God and his son, Jesus. Iceland remained resolutely pagan, loyal to old gods such as Odin; the All Father; a one-eyed god who had sacrificed the other eye in exchange for knowledge of runes; and Thor, the thunder-god with his great hammer Mj lnir, who was also especially popular with warriors.

(Photo By DEA/G DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini/Getty Images) Iceland became Christian to avoid a civil war. Competing pagan and Christian factions threatened to tear the Althing apart and dissolve Iceland into separate, religiously hostile, states. At the Althing s meeting in the year 1000 the rival factions appealed to Iceland s most important official, the lawspeaker Thorgeir Thorkelsson. As a pagan he might have been expected to favour the old gods but, after an entire day spent agonising over the decision, he concluded that henceforth all Icelanders would be Christian. A few exceptions were made   for example the eating of horsemeat, a favoured delicacy that was also associated with pagan sacrifices, was to be permitted. Listen | Acclaimed screenwriter and producer Michael Hirst talks about his work on Vikings and the secrets of making great history drama What was Valhalla and how did Vikings get there? For a Viking, what two things would be desired the most in the afterlife of Valhalla, the hall of slain warriors? Feasting and fighting, of course. If chosen to die by the mythical Valkyries, a Norse warrior longed to be welcomed by the god Odin into Valhalla, a magnificent hall with a roof thatched with golden shields, spears for rafters, and so large that 540 doors lined its walls, says BBC History Revealed magazine. The honoured dead, known as the Einherjar, spent all day honing their battle skills against each other in preparation for Ragnar k   the end of the world   then every night, their wounds magically healed and they partied like only Vikings could. Their drinking horns never emptied thanks to Heidrun, a goat on the roof of Valhalla that ate from a special tree and produced the finest mead, and there was always enough meat as the boar named S hr mnir came back to life after each slaughter so it could be cooked over and over. To join the Einherjar, a Viking had to die in battle   and even then, they only had a 50:50 chance. The half not chosen to go to Valhalla instead went to the field of the goddess Freya, so they could offer to the women who died as maidens their company. As for the old or sick, they went to an underworld called Hel. It was largely not as bad as the name suggests, though there was a special place of misery reserved for murderers, adulterers and oath-breakers, where a giant dragon chewed on their corpses. Where did the Vikings travel to? Iceland, too, was the platform from which the Vikings launched their furthest-flung explorations. In 982 a fiery tempered chieftain, Erik the Red, who had already been exiled from Norway for his father s part in a homicide, was then exiled from Iceland for involvement in another murder. He had heard rumours of land to the west and, with a small group of companions, sailed in search of it. What he found was beyond his wildest imaginings. Only 300 kilometres west of Iceland, Greenland is the world s largest island, and its south and south-west tip had fjords [deep, narrow and elongated sea or lakedrain, with steep land on three sides] and lush pastures that must have reminded Erik of his Scandinavian homeland. He returned back to Iceland, gathered 25 ship-loads of settlers and established a new Viking colony in Greenland that survived into the 15th century. Erik s son, Leif, outdid his father. Having heard from another Viking Greenlander, Bjarni Herjolfsson, that he had sighted land even further west, Leif went to see for himself. In around 1002 he and his crew found themselves sailing somewhere along the coast of North America. They found a glacial, mountainous coast, then a wooded one, and finally a country of fertile pastures that they named Vinland. Although they resolved to start a new colony there, it was   unlike either Iceland or Greenland   already settled and hostility from native Americans and their own small numbers (Greenland at the time probably had about 3,000 Viking inhabitants) meant that it was soon abandoned. They had, though, become the first Europeans to land in (and settle in) the Americas, almost five centuries before Christopher Columbus. For centuries Erik s achievement lived on only in a pair of sagas, The Saga of the Greenlanders and Erik the Red s Saga. The location of Vinland, despite attempts to work out where it lay from information contained in the sagas, remained elusive. It was even unclear if the Vikings really had reached North America. Then, in the early 1960s, a Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his archaeologist wife, Anne Stine, found the remains of ancient houses at L Anse aux Meadows on Newfoundland in Canada. Fragments of worked iron (many of them nails, probably from a ship), which the native population did not possess the technology to produce, meant that it was soon clear this was a Viking settlement. Although perhaps too small to be the main Vinland colony, it was still astonishing confirmation of what the sagas had said. Leif Erikson s reputation as a great explorer and discoverer of new lands was confirmed without doubt. Who discovered America? It wasn't Christopher Columbus... This might well have pleased him, for a man s reputation was everything to a Viking. Quick wit, bravery and action were among the key attributes for a Viking warrior, but to be remembered for great deeds was the most important of all. The H vam l, a collection of Viking aphorisms, contains much apt advice such as  Never let a bad man know your own bad fortune , but most famous of all is the saying  Cattle die, kindred die, we ourselves shall die, but I know one thing that never dies: the reputations of each one dead . Did Viking shield-maidens exist? Apologies to fans of the hit series Vikings: historians just can t agree on whether Norse warrior women like Lagertha actually existed, says BBC History Revealed magazine. While there are stories of shield-maidens, or skjaldmaer, in historical accounts, nearly all can be dismissed as unreliable, apocryphal, allegorical or more myth than reality. Still, tantalising clues and mysterious finds   including artefacts showing women carrying swords, spears and shields   have boosted the idea that Viking women went into battle alongside men. In the 12th century, the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus wrote of women in Denmark who sought  so zealously to be skilled in warfare that they might have been thought to have unsexed themselves . In 2017, meanwhile, archaeologists discovered that a 10th-century grave of a warrior, filled with weapons, actually belonged to a woman. What was a Viking sunstone? The Vikings were superb sailors who got as far afield as Russia and North America, but their navigational techniques haven t always been completely understood, says BBC History Revealed magazine. A mysterious  sunstone , mentioned in a medieval Icelandic saga, was considered mere legend until an opaque crystal, made from Iceland spar, was recently discovered among the navigation equipment of a sunken Tudor shipwreck. Intriguingly, scientists have proven that Iceland spar, when held up to the sky, forms a solar compass that indicates the Sun s location, through concentric rings of polarised light, even in thick cloud cover or after dusk. It s now thought that this was the mysterious sunstone that helped guide Vikings such as  Lucky  Leif Erikson to Newfoundland, and usage of it may have persisted until the end of the 16th century. When did the Viking Age end? It is traditionally said that the raiding, pillaging age of the Vikings, which began in Britain with the ransacking of Lindisfarne in AD 793, ended with the failure of Harald Hardrada s invasion in 1066. Yet the Viking influence spread from the Middle East to North America, and could not be undone by a single defeat in battle. At the same time that Hardrada was picking up his career-ending neck injury at Stamford Bridge, the Norman Conquest was being launched. Its leader, and future king of England, was William   the great-great-great-grandson of Rollo, a Viking. Philip Parker is author of The Northmen s Fury: A History of the Viking World (Vintage, 2015).

        "title": "Why did the Vikings' violent raids begin?",
        "content": "On a clear day, a Viking longship at sea could be seen some 18 nautical miles away. With a favourable wind, that distance could be covered in about an hour   which was perhaps all the time that the monks at Lindisfarne had to prepare themselves against attack on one fateful day in 793. This was the raid that signalled the start of the violence associated with the onset of the Viking age. Ad  We and our fathers have now lived in this fair land for nearly 350 years, and never before has such an atrocity been seen in Britain as we have now suffered at the hands of a pagan people. Such a voyage was not thought possible. The church of Saint Cuthbert is spattered with the blood of the priests of God, stripped of all its furnishings, exposed to the plundering of pagans   a place more sacred than any in Britain.  The extract is from a letter, written in the wake of the attack, to King  thelred of Northumbria by Alcuin. Alcuin had been a monk in York before accepting an invitation in 781 to join Charlemagne at his court in Aachen, where he became the Frankish king s leading spiritual advisor. Historians have been inclined to take Alcuin s astonishment at the raid at face value, and supposed the Vikings to be a wholly unknown quantity. Yet in the same letter Alcuin rebuked  thelred and his courtiers for aping the fashions of the heathens:  Consider the luxurious dress, hair and behaviour of leaders and people,  he urged the king.  See how you have wanted to copy the pagan way of cutting hair and beards. Are not these the people whose terror threatens us, yet you want to copy their hair?  The obvious conclusion is that, at the time of the raid, the Northumbrians were already familiar with their Norwegian visitors. What was new was the violence. Vikings Season 6 arrives on Amazon Prime on 30 December: catch up on what s happened so far Lindisfarne turned out to be the start of a wave of similar attacks on monasteries in northern Britain. Alcuin, with his local knowledge, warned the religious communities at nearby Wearmouth and Jarrow to be on their guard:  You live by the sea from whence this plague first came.  In 794, Vikings  ravaged in Northumbria, and plundered Ecgfrith s monastery at Donemuthan . The 12th century historian Symeon of Durham identified this as the monastery at Jarrow, and reported that its protector, Saint Cuthbert, had not let the heathens go unpunished,  for their chief was killed by the English  And these things befell them rightly, for they had gravely injured those who had not injured them.  Shetland and Orkney were probably overrun during this first wave of violence, and the indigenous population of Picts wiped out so swiftly that local place names and the names of natural phenomena such as rivers and mountains vanished, to be replaced by Scandinavian names. Ireland and the Western Isles of Scotland suffered, too. The Annals of Ulster report the burning in 795 of the monastery at Rechru, and the Isle of Skye  overwhelmed and laid waste . Iona was attacked for a first time in 795 and again in 802. In a third raid in 806 the monastery was torched and the community of 68 wiped out. Work started the following year on a safe refuge for the revived community at Kells in Ireland. In 799 the island monastery of Noirmoutier off the north-west coast of France was attacked for the first time. By 836 it had been raided so often that its monks also abandoned the site and sought refuge in a safer location. It soon become clear, however, that there was no such thing as a safe refuge. Best form of defence Why was there such hatred in the attacks, and why did they start in 793, rather than 743, or 843? To look for a triggering event we need to examine the political situation in northern Europe at the time. At the commencement of the Viking age, the major political powers in the world were Byzantium in the east; the Muslims, whose expansion had taken them as far as Turkistan and Asia Minor to create an Islamic barrier between the northern and southern hemispheres; and the Franks, who had become the dominant tribe among the successor states after the fall of the Roman empire in the west. Charlemagne became sole ruler of the Franks in 771. He took seriously the missionary obligations imposed on him by his position as the most powerful ruler in western Christendom, and expended a huge amount of energy on the subjugation of the heathen Saxons on his north-east border. In 772, his forces crossed into Saxon territory and destroyed Irminsul, the sacred tree that was their most holy totem. In 779, Widukind, the Saxon leader, was defeated in battle at Bocholt and Saxony taken over and divided into missionary districts. Charlemagne himself presided over a number of mass baptisms. In 782, his armies forcibly baptised and then executed 4,500 Saxon captives at Verden, on the banks of the river Aller. Campaigns of enforced resettlement followed, but resistance continued until a final insurrection was put down in 804. By this time Charlemagne had already been rewarded for his missionary activities by Pope Leo III who in Rome in AD 800 crowned him imperator   emperor not of a geographical area nor even of a collection of peoples but of the abstract conception of Christendom as a single community. With their physical subjugation complete, the cultural subjugation of the Saxons followed. Death was the penalty for eating meat during Lent; death for cremating the dead in accordance with heathen rites; death for rejecting baptism. Several times, in the course of the campaign of resistance, Widukind sought refuge across the border with his brother-in-law Sigfrid, a Danish king. News of Charlemagne s depredations, and in particular the Verden massacre, must have travelled like a shock wave through Danish territory and beyond. How should the heathen Scandinavians react to the threat? For, whether they knew it or not, they were on Alcuin s list of peoples to be converted. In 789 he wrote to a friend working among the Saxons:  Tell me, is there any hope of our converting the Danes?  The question for the Vikings was: should they simply wait for Charlemagne s armies to arrive and set about the task? Or should they fight to defend their culture? A military campaign against the might of Frankish Christendom was out of the question. However, the Christian monasteries   such as Lindisfarne   dotted around the rim of northern Europe were symbolically important and, in the parlance of modern terrorist warfare,  soft targets . So, with an indifference to the humanity of their victims as complete as that of Charlemagne s towards the Saxons, these first Viking raiders were able to set off on a punishing series of attacks in the grip of a no-holds-barred rage directed at Christian  others . The Christian annalists who documented Viking violence insistently saw the conflict as a battle between religious cultures. A century after the first attack on Lindisfarne, Asser, in his biography of Alfred the Great, continued to refer to the much larger bands of Vikings who had by now established thdaemselves along the eastern seaboard of England as  the pagans  (pagani), and to their victims as  Christians  (christiani). Clash of faiths Attacks such as those mounted by Vikings were almost impossible to defend against, and long before Asser s time the raiders had discovered how easy it was to plunder what was probably the richest country in western Europe. In 851 a fleet of 350 ships sailed up the Thames to attack London and Canterbury then, instead of sailing home, spent the winter encamped at Thanet. It was a prelude to the arrival in 865 of what the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle called the  Great Heathen Army    a force that, after 15 years of warring against the demoralised kingdoms of Northumbria, Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia, had gained control of England from York down to East Anglia. By 927 much of the lost territory had been regained by the Wessex king Alfred the Great, his son Edward and grandson  thelstan, but by that time the achievements of the Great Heathen Army had became part of the cultural history of young Viking males. Large-scale Viking violence returned to England during the reign of King  thelred in the 990s, under the Dane, Swein Forkbeard, and the Norwegian, Olaf Tryggvason. The policy of the  danegeld    protection money paid in return for being left alone   was practised with a punishing regularity. It was with wealth gained in this fashion that the Viking Olaf Tryggvason financed his successful bid for the crown of Norway in 995. In 1012 the archbishop of Canterbury was captured and, when the ransom demanded for him was not forthcoming, was murdered for the sport of a drunken group of men under the Viking earl Thorkell the Tall. They pelted him with bones, stones, blocks of wood and the skulls of cattle before finishing him off with the flat of an axe. The loss of its spiritual head brought the faltering Anglo-Saxon monarchy to its knees, and within two years a Danish king, Swein Forkbeard, was on the throne of England. By 1028 Swein s son Cnut was ruler of a North Sea empire that included Denmark (with Sk ne in Sweden), Norway, and all England. In name, at least, the heathens were now Christians but their pride in themselves as conquering warriors remained strong. A poem in praise of Cnut   composed by his Icelandic court poet, Sigvat   invoked the memory of the Northumbrian king  lla of York, defeated in battle by Ivar the Boneless during the first surge of the Great Heathen Army:  And Ivar, who dwelt in York, carved the eagle on  lla s back.  Remarkably, Cnut s triumphs figured in Sigvat s literary imagination as the successful resolution of a conflict that had been going on for over 150 years, beginning as a series of gestures of cultural self-defence and soon after developing into dreams of conquest. Alcuin had foreseen the ultimate consequences of the first Viking raid of 793 with visionary precision.  Who does not fear this?  he asked King  thelred of Northumbria.  Who does not lament this as if his country were captured?  In his distress, he was overlooking the fact that the Vikings were only doing what his own Saxon forefathers had done to the Britons and Celts of the kingdoms of England some three and a half centuries earlier, conquering  this fair land  by the same means   violence   as the Vikings. Cnut was unlucky with his sons, and Danish rule in England lasted less than 30 years. Fifteen years on and the memories of King Cnut and his North Sea empire were all but wiped out by the greater drama of Duke William of Normandy s conquest of 1066. Robert Ferguson has been a leading scholar and exponent of Scandinavian culture and history for over 30 years. He lives in Oslo and on the Isle of Cumbrae. Three other explanations for Viking violence Faster ships, internal strife and new trade links may also have helped trigger the raids Technological advances that encouraged piracy The onset of the Viking age coincided with the appearance of the technologically advanced, sail-powered longship   the stealth bomber of its time. Longships such as the Oseberg ship (built 820) replaced giant man-powered vessels like the Storhaug ship, found on Karm y (buried 779), opening up the seas to young Scandinavian pirates as never before. Poverty and overpopulation In his history On the Customs and Deeds of the First Norman Dukes (995 1015), Dudo of Saint-Quentin wrote that, in former times in the Scandinavian homelands, quarrels over land and property were resolved by  the drawing of lots . Losers were condemned to a life abroad where  by fighting they can gain themselves countries . A flood of riches into Scandinavia Trading led to an influx of silver bullion into Scandinavia from the Islamic world, creating elites around which ambitious young men gathered. Leaders had to reward these men for their military support and loyalty, and did so by plundering abroad on the grand scale. The etymology of the word  Viking  It is not even certain that  Viking  is Scandinavian in origin. It occurs several times in the Old English poems Widsith, usually dated to the end of the seventh century, and in the eighth-century Exodus, in which the tribe of Reuben are described as  s wicingas , meaning  sea-warriors , as they cross the Red Sea on their way out of Egypt. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle uses the term only four times before 1066, in the native English forms w cenga or w cinga, in 879, 885, 921 and 982. Some linguists believe it derives from the Latin v cus, meaning  camp  or  dwelling-place . Others suggest it comes from an Old Norse verb v kja, meaning  to travel from place to place . A simple and persuasive theory is that it originally denoted people from the Vik, the name for the bay area of south-east Norway around the Oslo fjord that also denoted the inland coastal region, and included the coast of Bohusl n in present-day Sweden. There is support for the suggestion in the frequency with which the waters of the Vik appear in saga literature, suggesting it was the most heavily trafficked maritime area in the region at the time.

        "title": "Forget the longships: this is the overlooked story of how the Vikings dominated eastern Europe",
        "content": "The Norse peoples of the Viking Age held much of western Europe tightly in their grip thanks to their imperious command of the sea. Ad Their prowess as seafarers let them strike their targets at speed and then slip away just as swiftly, in repeated cycles of relentless raids from the fertile shores of the British Isles to the harsher coasts of Iceland that brought wealth and power. Viking longships carved with fearsome, dragon-headed prows crashed through imposing waves, delivering warriors to burn monasteries and terrorise prosperous lands. These vessels were key to their hit-and-run strategy, and to its eventual evolution into something more settled as the Norse forged enduring strongholds on hostile ground. But for the Vikings who ventured east toward the Slavic and Baltic regions, the story unfolded very differently. Conquests there weren t defined by ocean raids, but by a remarkable capacity for canny adaptation. In the territories of today s Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, the Norse traded the open sea for winding rivers, turning inland waterways into vital thoroughfares of commerce, conflict and state-building.  The rivers are absolutely critical,  explains historian Martyn Whittock, author of Vikings in the East, speaking on the HistoryExtra podcast.  We need to envisage them as the motorways of the early medieval world, which allow people access deep into the heart of the European continent, particularly the east.  When did the Vikings first head east? Archaeological finds from the mid-eighth century (including Scandinavian-style burials in places like Staraya Ladoga, near modern St Petersburg) show that the Norse were already present on the Baltic-Russian frontier before the famous raids on Britain had even begun. These early Norse pioneers were traders as well as warriors. They followed the Neva and Volkhov rivers into the interior, establishing bases like Ladoga and Novgorod. From there, they probed deeper, carrying boats and their cargo overland between river systems. Read more | Norse gods and goddesses: 14 of the most important deities venerated by the Vikings By the ninth century, Norse settlers were establishing footholds from which they could push further inland.  We first see Norse settlements appear in eastern Europe along the southern shores of the Baltic,  says Whittock.  Increasingly they were utilising river systems which flow into the Baltic, and by following them along their courses into what is now northwestern Russia, they could then port ships across gaps in the river systems to connect with other river systems.  Swapping longships for log boats While the famous longships were ideal for crossing seas, they were less suited to being hauled over rapids or dragging across portages. So, in the east, Vikings turned to different vessels.  To start with, we should be thinking of squatter, stronger and broader trading vessels than the dragon-prowed ships of popular imagination,  says Whittock. The Norse also adopted local craft. Archaeological evidence shows they purchased huge unfinished log boats from Finnic and Slavic neighbours, later fitting them with sails. These sturdy ships could handle rapids and were easier to portage than larger ships. Read more | The dark reality of Norse life on the edge And in winter, transport shifted to sledges, which were ideal for gliding across frozen rivers and snowbound plains.  We need to think of sledges, because we always think of summer transport,  says Whittock.  And yet in many of these areas, winter transport on frozen rivers or frozen, snowy landscapes would be on sledges. That's the kind of mental image we need to have: more of a mixed economy of transport.  By log boat or sledge, the Norse moved steadily southwards through modern-day Russia, past today s Smolensk, into Ukraine, and eventually to Kyiv. That city became the hub of a new and lasting regional power: Kievan Rus, the central hub of the Rus Vikings. This 8th-century runestone depicts a Viking longship   a powerful symbol of Norse identity, seafaring prowess, and the raiding and trading voyages that shaped the Viking Age. (Photo by Getty Images) Who were the Rus, and where does the name come from? The name  Rus  itself may refer explicitly to this river-faring identity.  It s interesting that one of the possible word origins for the name  Rus  is from a mixed Finnish, old East Norse word, which means rowers: those who row,  Whittock explains. Before they were the inhabitants of Kievan Rus, they were Vikings of the kind introduced by Whittock, moving along rivers, rowing against currents and hauling boats across land. This eastward expansion would have been impossible without the rivers that stretched across the Eurasian plain like veins. Read more | The truth about Viking berserkers  Those rivers that flow north into the Baltic allowed access well into the heart of Russia. It was then possible to pick up other major river systems that then flow south into Ukraine and towards the Caspian Sea,  Whittock notes. A closer look at the geography of eastern Europe shows the river system that made this possible. The Dnieper linked Novgorod and Smolensk to the Black Sea and Constantinople. The Volga carried Norse merchants towards the Caspian, opening routes to Persia and the Islamic caliphates. These rivers made Scandinavia part of a global economy stretching to Byzantium, Baghdad and beyond. The rise of Rus The Rus settlements steadily grew into a federation of principalities ruled by Scandinavian dynasties but populated mainly by Slavs. Over generations, intermarriage and cultural exchange transformed the Norse elites. They adopted Slavic languages, Byzantine Christianity and local customs. By the late ninth century, leaders like Rurik (credited as founder of the Rus dynasty) and his successors, Oleg and Igor, were consolidating power in Novgorod and Kyiv, extracting tribute from Slavic tribes and expanding their authority through warfare and alliances. By the late 10th century, rulers like Vladimir the Great were more Slavic than Norse in culture, even if their lineage traced back to Scandinavia. The Norse had become the Rus: a distinct identity forged by geography and circumstance. Kyiv emerged as the heart of this world. Its location on the Dnieper made it a natural hub for trade flowing between Scandinavia, Byzantium and the steppe. From here, the rulers of Rus built a power that stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea. 1066: The battle for England Member exclusive | The year 1066 is the most famous in English history, but there's a lot more to the story than one bloody battle at Hastings.

In this four-part series, medievalist Marc Morris talks David Musgrove through the full story of the Norman Conquest. A distinct Viking identity: the Rus vs the Icelanders The Rus experience diverged sharply from that of Norse settlers in the west. In Iceland, Vikings recreated a Scandinavian society, carrying their laws, sagas and language with them across the North Atlantic. Isolation preserved their Norse culture in near-pure form. Read more | 10 incredible Viking stories from Norse mythology In eastern Europe, by contrast, the Vikings were absorbed into a much larger Slavic world. Over time, the Norse language faded, replaced by Old East Slavic. Pagan traditions gave way to Byzantine Orthodox Christianity. Norse sagas never took root; instead, the Rus produced chronicles and legal codes in Slavic style.  This began as a Norse Slavic state, but it increasingly became a Slavic state with Norse echoes. There was an awareness of origins and a real awareness of connectivity to the northern world, but by the year 1,000 this was an increasingly a Slavic state,  says Whittock. The Viking story in eastern Europe is one of adaptation and transformation. In the west, Norsemen dominated seas and coastlines. In the east, they turned rivers, frozen or flowing, into a tool of power. In the process, they stopped being only Norse. They became the Rus: a people who built a state undeniably distinct from their cousins in Iceland or Norway. Ad Martyn Whittock was speaking to James Osborne on the HistoryExtra podcast.

        "content": "The raid on Lindisfarne On 8 June 793, the terrified inhabitants of the small Northumbrian island of Lindisfarne found themselves under attack. Norse longboats landed on the holy island with the intention of plundering its monastery's riches. Treasures were stolen, religious relics destroyed and monks murdered, in a brutal and shocking start to the Viking age and centuries of Viking activity in Britain. Ad Anglo-Saxon monasteries made rich pickings for Viking raiders. The British Isles  religious communities could offer little resistance to the plundering of their treasures. Furthermore, as pagans, the Viking attackers had no religious qualms about desecrating sacred sites. Lindisfarne was not the first time Scandinavians had visited on the British Isles. While they had largely come to trade peacefully, there had been sporadic violence. In 789 three ships of Norsemen had landed on the coast of the kingdom of Wessex and murdered one of the king s officials. Yet the merciless raid on Lindisfarne s monastery was different   it was an unprecedented brutal strike right at the heart of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. The shocking event spread fear and panic across Christian Europe. The scholar Alcuin argued that God, as vengeance on the immoral people of the kingdom of Northumbria, had sent the raiders. The attack was not easily forgotten. In the ninth century, Lindisfarne s Anglo-Saxon residents memorialised the violence by carving the scenes of bloodshed onto a stone grave marker. The stone, now kept in Lindisfarne s museum, is known as the  Viking Domesday Stone . Just as Christian communities had feared, Lindisfarne heralded the beginning of further death and destruction, as Viking raids on Britain escalated over the following years.

Up until this point, Scandinavian expeditions to the British Isles had consisted of smaller raiding parties on  smash-and-grab  missions. Their intention was to plunder the islands  riches before returning to their homelands with the loot. The Great Heathen Army was different however   it was a calculated invasion force. The army was a coalition consisting of soldiers from Norway and Denmark, and possibly also Sweden. According to legend, various bands of Norsemen came together under the leadership of the three sons of legendary Viking warlord Ragnar Lothrok   Halfdan Ragnarsson, Ivar the Boneless and Ubba. The number of troops in the army is unclear   estimates range from less than 1,000 men to several thousands. The Great Heathen Army landed on the coast of East Anglia in the autumn of 865, picking up horses before going on to capture Northumbria and York. For several years, frequent fighting plagued the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, as rulers proved unable to subdue the spread of the Viking invaders. By 874, Wessex was the only Anglo-Saxon kingdom not under effective Viking control. 866   York is conquered by Viking forces As a thriving Anglo-Saxon metropolis and prosperous economic hub, York was a clear target for the Vikings. Led by Ivar the Boneless and Halfdan, Scandinavian forces attacked the town on All Saints  Day. Launching the assault on a holy day proved an effective tactical move   most of York s leaders were in the cathedral, leaving the town vulnerable to attack and unprepared for battle. After it was conquered, the city was renamed from the Saxon Eoforwic to Jorvik. It became the capital of Viking territory in Britain, and at its peak boasted more than 10,000 inhabitants. This was a population second only to London within Great Britain. Jorvik proved an important economic and trade centre for the Vikings. Norse coinage was created at the Jorvik mint, while archaeologists have found evidence of a variety of craft workshops around the town s central Coppergate area. These demonstrate that textile production, metalwork, carving, glasswork and jewellery-making were all practised in Jorvik. Materials from as far afield as the Arabian gulf have also been discovered, suggesting that the town was part of an international trading network. According to Dr Soren Sindbaek, urban living in the tightly packed streets of Jorvik was unusual for Viking settlers, whose traditional lifestyle was agricultural. Sindbaek argues that for a Viking,  the commonest path is to farm the land  If you end up in towns, something s almost always gone wrong.  Jorvik's last Viking king was Eric Bloodaxe. Depicted in Norse sagas as a bloody tyrant, Bloodaxe was expelled from York in 954, after which the town returned to Anglo-Saxon rule. A silver penny minted in 10th-century Jorvik.

However, Viking forces had failed to conquer Wessex, under the rule of Alfred the Great. After two unsuccessful invasion attempts, in 878 the army launched a third attack on Alfred s kingdom. At the ensuing battle of Edington, they met with a crushing defeat at the hands of the Anglo-Saxons and Viking leader Guthrum met with Alfred to negotiate terms. A peace treaty was established. Guthrum agreed to baptism and assumed the Anglo-Saxon name Aethelstan. In return, Alfred formally recognised the Viking leader as king of East Anglia. As part of this peace treaty, a political boundary was drawn up, dividing Aethelstan s Norse territory in the north-east and Alfred s Anglo-Saxon lands in the south-west. The Viking region, known as the Danelaw, was to be dominated by Norse customs and law-codes, different to those of the surrounding Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The first article of the treaty formally drawn up between Alfred and Guthrum has been taken to mark out the boundaries of the Danelaw. It reads    First concerning our boundaries: up on the Thames, and then up on the Lea, and along the Lea unto its source, then straight to Bedford, then up on the Ouse to Watling Street.  The treaty also laid down laws to establish peaceful co-existence between the two kingdoms. Its fifth article banned attacks by raiding bands, set down rules for the exchange of hostages and slaves and made allowances for safe trading between Vikings and Anglo-Saxons. Listen | Acclaimed screenwriter and producer Michael Hirst talks about his work on Vikings and the secrets of making great history drama Although the Danelaw was never extensively settled by Vikings and had dissolved by c954, the impact of Norse rule on England s north-east was significant and long lasting. Echoes of the Danelaw could be traced forward in the social customs and law codes (such as severe fines for breach of the peace) of the region for many centuries. Norse influence can still be seen in the area s place names, especially in the central Viking hub of Yorkshire. Here, you can still find many town names ending in  thorpe , the Norse term for an outlying farmstead, and  by , which meant a farmstead or village.

As the Danish kingdom became increasingly powerful, Viking raiders began to target the British Isles with a renewed ferocity. In 991 Danish king Swein Forkbeard landed in Kent with more than 90 longboats, before exacting a cruel victory over Anglo-Saxon forces at the battle of Maldon. Over the following two decades, Swein led several more destructive campaigns in England. While Norse raids had been targeting the Britain Isles since the eighth century, it was unprecedented for these raids to be led by the king himself. Raids were on a larger scale than ever before, and Swein s Danish forces proved unstoppable as they ravaged England s major towns and extorted money from their leaders. By 1012, the Anglo-Saxons  situation had reached breaking point. Payments to the Danes, known as Danegeld, had proved crippling. Anglo-Saxon leaders were forced to raise 22,000kg of silver, largely levied through tax. The same year, Viking raiders led by Thorkell the Tall (it is debated whether Thorkell was an agent of Swein or not) plundered Canterbury and held the archbishop Aelfheah hostage for seven months. When he refused to let anyone pay his ransom they pelted him to death with bones and struck him over the head with an axe. c1000   The Vikings reach North America The British Isles were not the only destination of seafaring Norse traders, raiders and adventurers. Paris, Iceland, Italy and even the Iberian peninsula and Morocco were also visited by the Vikings. Remarkable archaeological discoveries have revealed that Norse longboats even travelled huge distances to North America, making the Vikings the first Europeans to land on the continent. In 1960, evidence of Norse settlement was uncovered at L Anse aux Meadows, a site on the northernmost tip of the island of Newfoundland, off the east coast of Canada. Who discovered America? It wasn't Christopher Columbus... Investigation into the site began after archaeologists found a small cloak pin that appeared to be of Scandinavian origin. Further archaeological work revealed timber-framed buildings identical to ones in Viking settlements discovered in Greenland and Iceland. After extensive work on the sites, experts have suggested that there were in fact Norse settlers in Newfoundland, but they stayed close to the coast and abandoned the site just a few years after it was founded. According to Norse sagas, the first Viking explorer to reach North America was Leif Erikson, a fearless seafaring adventurer who discovered  Vinland . The description of  Vinland  in the sagas has been seen by some to match the site in Newfoundland. In 2015, a potential new site of Viking settlement was found at Point Rosee, on Newfoundland s south-west coast. Identified using infrared satellite images and aerial photographs, the site contains promising evidence of iron-smelting, and turf walls which match Norse construction styles. Further investigation into the site is planned for later this year. Replicas Of Norse sod houses in L anse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland.

Although Swein had been campaigning in Britain from 991 onwards, fighting had been piecemeal. His troops were repeatedly forced back to Scandinavia   in 999 by an attempted coup in his homeland and in 1005 by famine in Britain. However, after decades of patchy campaigning, in 1013 Swein s attempts to conquer the entirety of Anglo-Saxon England finally came to fruition. By 1013, Oxford, Bath, Winchester and many other major towns had capitulated to Swein s forces. After fierce resistance, London also finally submitted, its residents afraid of what the Viking forces might inflict on them. Following these victories, the Anglo-Saxon king Aethelred the Unready was forced into exile in Normandy and Swein was finally accepted as king of England. However, after battling for so long to add England to his great Scandinavian empire, Swein s reign was short-lived. Only five weeks after he was pronounced king of England, Forkbeard died on 3 February 1014. It took two more years of intensive fighting before the country was returned to Viking rule, under Swein s son Cnut. King Cnut reigned over England for 19 years, finally bringing a period of relative peace and stability to the kingdom and uniting his Anglo-Saxon and Danish subjects. Listen | Thomas Williams explores the key events and legacies of the Viking era 1066   The end of the Viking age The death of Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor (of the House of Wessex) in 1066 led to a power-struggle for the English crown. The Viking contender for the throne was Harald Hardrada, king of Norway. Descended from the line of the kings of Norway ousted by Cnut a generation earlier, Hardrada claimed a right to the throne based on an agreement between his father and Hardicanute, Cnut's son and successor. In an effort to reclaim England for the Scandinavians, in 1066 Hardrada sailed to England with 300 ships stuffed full of 11,000 warriors. His intention was to seize the throne from the vulnerable Anglo-Saxon king Harold Godwinson, who was also expecting a Norman invasion from the south. After sailing up the river Ouse and seizing York, Hardrada s forces were taken by surprise by the Anglo-Saxon troops at Stamford Bridge. Harold Godwinson s men had travelled north with remarkable speed, meaning that the Scandinavian forces were unprepared to take them on. Not expecting Harold Godwinson to leave the south under the threat of Norman invasion, Hardrada had left both men and armour behind with his anchored fleet at Riccall. The Viking army was smashed and Hardrada killed by an arrow through the neck. It was reported that of the 300 longboats that landed in England, only 24 returned to their homeland carrying the survivors. Despite proving a failure, the Viking invasion of 1066 nonetheless had a significant impact on British history. Taking on the Vikings at Stamford Bridge had weakened Harold Godwinson s forces, making the path easier for the successful invasion of William of Normandy. William defeated Godwinson at the battle of Hastings just three weeks later, going on to launch a conquest more successful and long lasting than any Viking invasion. Hardrada s crushing defeat at Stamford Bridge is generally seen as the end of Viking influence in Britain. Centuries of raiding, extortion, trading and bloodshed had finally come to a close.

        "content": "Hitler has only got one ball, / Goring has two but very small, / Himmler is rather sim lar, / But poor old Goebbels has no balls at all.  Ad This cheeky wartime ditty mocking the masculinity of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi leadership, set to the jaunty tune of the Coloney Bogey March, was once a familiar favourite in schoolyards in Britain and beyond. The lyrics often change   in one variant, it is suggested in rhyme that the Fuhrer s remaining testicle now resides as something of a war trophy in the Albert Hall   but where does this claim come from, and is there any truth to it? Is there any truth that Hitler had one testicle? On balance it seems unlikely that Hitler only had one testicle, but there are conflicting arguments on both sides. That said, there have been several stories that, if true, would mean the song was actually based on anatomical fact. According to one, Hitler lost a testicle during the First World War after being hit by shrapnel at the battle of the Somme in 1916; another says the injury occurred much earlier, in childhood, during an altercation with a goat. It all seems to be the stuff of hearsay. Although Hitler was wounded at the Somme, it was in the thigh rather than the groin. What s more, that claim comes from many decades later from an unconfirmed source, a priest who supposedly took the confession of the German medic who treated Lance Corporal Hitler. Perhaps the single best piece of evidence that counters the claim that Hitler only had one testicle comes from the doctor who treated Hitler as a child, an Austrian Jew named Eduard Bloch who fled to the United States in 1940, insisted to American interrogators that the genitals of the future Fuhrer were  completely normal . Still, the seemingly endless fascination with Hitler s reproductive equipment and sexual proclivities has persisted over the decades. Years after the war, a new claim emerged that the Soviets had carried out an autopsy of Hitler after taking Berlin in 1945, in which they found he did indeed have a missing testicle. This is not widely accepted as credible, however. Read more | Did Hitler escape to Argentina after WW2? Was anything wrong with Hitler s testicle? In 2015, a German researcher was able to study the medical records made during an examination of Hitler at Landsberg Prison. He was held there after the failure of the Munich Beer Hall Putsch, the failed uprising he instigated in 1923. According to the notes written by Dr Josef Steiner Brin, Hitler was  healthy and strong , but did have a  right-side cryptorchidism , or an undescended right testicle. Read more | The history of the Hitler salute Where does the song  Hitler has only got one ball  come from? The song appeared in the early days of the Second World War. While its origins are unknown (over the years several people have claimed they wrote the lyrics to be used for propaganda purposes), it caught on with the British soldiers as a means of ridiculing Hitler. Crude and childish, it aimed to emasculate both the Nazi leader and his inner circle, by implying they were not full men. Singing about Hitler and co. not having the usual number of balls was to call them cowards too:  to have no balls  is another way to say someone has no courage or nerve. Ad By bringing Hitler s physical state into question, there may have been a further intention to the song in challenging the Nazis  claims about a master race of perfect humans. When they were talking all the time about tall, muscular blond-haired, blue-eyed Aryans, the song serves to illustrate how Hitler, and those around him, were far from meeting those standard themselves.",

        "title": "Why did Hitler choose the swastika as a Nazi symbol?",
        "content": "The swastika is today synonymous with Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime; a red and black symbol of the Second World War. But this hasn't always been the case   the swastika existed as a symbol long before it was adopted by the Nazis, and the symbol's story is longer and more complex than you might expect. Ad So how and why did the Nazis use the swastika, and what is the ancient origin of the symbol made infamous by Hitler? Why did Hitler choose the swastika? When Adolf Hitler began his rise to power and looked for a symbol to encapsulate his movement, the Nazi Party and a strong future for Germany, the swastika became the clear choice. German antiquarian Heinrich Schliemann had grown obsessed with finding Troy, the lost city of Greek mythology, and in 1868 he set out with his copy of The Iliad to search the Mediterranean. Schliemann's search led him to the mysterious mound of Hisarlik on the Aegean coast of Turkey. There, during the 1870s, Schliemann unearthed layers of civilisations dating back thousands of years, and declared the oldest to be Troy. The city of legend had been found   although it turned out to be a different layer than the one Schliemann thought   as well as a cache of jewellery, bronze, silver and gold. Yet in the ancient ruins he made another fateful discovery: some 1,800 depictions of a symbol that resembled a cross with bent arms: the swastika. News of Schliemann s sensational excavations spread far and wide, quickly followed by the swastika, which became a ubiquitous sign, visible throughout Europe and North America. At the same time, however, the swastika s long history saw it become a favourite of German nationalists, who subscribed to a warped theory that they had descended from an ancient  master race  known as the Aryans. This belief persisted into the 20th century, growing more pernicious until it appealed to Adolf Hitler, the leader of the burgeoning Nazi Party. Hitler understood the power of an image and knew it would give the Nazi ideals an historic foundation. He could not adequately reconcile his view of Germany s Christian history with the religion s historical Jewish connections   essentially, that Christ was himself Jewish   so the idea that Germans descended from a white master race with a tried and tested symbol had great appeal. And so the swastika, or hakenkreuz (hooked cross), became the emblem of the Nazi Party in 1920; Hitler himself took personal credit for designing the flag. It used the red, white and black of the old German imperial flag   a cunning move to link Germany's past with its future   but attributed new meanings to them. \"In red we see the social idea of the movement, in white the nationalistic idea, in the swastika the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man,\" wrote Hitler in his 1925 autobiographical manifesto, Mein Kampf. The new design became the national flag on 15 September 1935 during the mass annual rally at Nuremberg. On the same day, two race laws were passed prohibiting marriages between Germans and Jews and declaring that only those of German blood could be citizens of the Reich. And so the act of cultural, religious and social theft that was the appropriation of the swastika was complete. It ensured that the Nazi flag would be associated with evil   under which a brutal war raged, atrocities committed and some six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. What is the swastika? A cross with arms bent at right angles meant many things to many people, but had always been used as a sign of hope and positivity. It could represent good fortune or prosperity; symbolise the Sun or the infinity of creation; or, as it still does in several religions, evoke a sense of the divine and call for auspiciousness. The word swastika itself derives from the Sanskrit svastika, meaning \"conducive to well-being\". What is the history of the swastika? The oldest-known example of the swastika dates back some 15,000 years. Discovered in Ukraine in 1908, an ivory mammoth tusk carved into the shape of a bird includes an intricate pattern of connected swastikas on its body, which may have been used as a fertility symbol. There is no knowing how the design first came about. It may have simply been an elegant, easy-to-create geometric shape, although its inspiration possibly came from a comet in the night sky. It was also in Eastern Europe that single swastikas were carved by the Vinca culture during the Neolithic period, some 7,000 years ago, before they became widespread from the Bronze Age. The swastika symbolised the Sun to the Illyrians; became a common sight on Mesopotamian coins; appeared on vases and clothing in Greece; formed mosaic motifs in Rome, and stands in as a stylised cross in Celtic design. There are 27 swastikas on the Iron Age Battersea Shield, found in London in 1857, but the symbol had been in Britain long before that as the so-called Swastika Stone on Ilkley Moor, Yorkshire, from c2,000 BC, shows. This carving resembles the swastika s shape, although with more curved arms and added spots. Swastikas could be found in Roman mosaics, as evidenced in this one excavated at Lullingtone Roman Villa in Eynsford, Kent (Photo by English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images) The swastika, often known as a gammadion or fylflot, continued to be used throughout Europe, occasionally being subsumed into religious iconography. Early Christian art depicts the hooked cross to represent Christ's victory over death, while a left-facing version of the swastika showed up in reference to the Norse god Thor's hammer. Still a popular symbol in medieval times, the swastika can be seen today on surviving church decorations, coats of arms and on textile fragments from the 12th century thought to be from a dress owned by a Slav princess. The monastery school a young Adolf Hitler attended, Lambach Abbey in Austria, had swastikas carved on the stone and woodwork. Yet the influence of the swastika reached much further than can be explained by the migration of peoples over the centuries. It has appeared in several cultures across northern Africa, including as window decorations in churches in modern-day Ethiopia, while also showing up in the Mayan, Aztec and Kuna civilisations of South and Central America. A number of Native American and First Nation tribes of North America, such as the Navajo, Hopi and Passamaquoddy, also adopted the symbol, which they called  whirling logs . Swastikas are prevalent and potent symbols in several religions: there s a small one on the chest of this Buddha in Hong Kong s Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery (Photo by Victor Fraile/Corbis via Getty Images) Undoubtedly the most enduring relationship with the swastika began in Asia, especially in India, among followers of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, for whom it has served as a holy symbol for millennia. To Jains, the swastika represents one of the 24 Tirthankara, or saviours, while Buddhists regard the symbol as the footprints of the Buddha. For Hindus, the right-hand svastika   a term that emerged c500 BC   is a sign of surya (the Sun) and auspiciousness, so is used to mark entrances, offerings, ceremonies, festivals and each year's account books. The left-hand version, the sauvastika, is symbolic of the night and the goddess Kali. The swastika remains as spiritually significant today, in the face of the stigma towards the symbol in the West brought on by the Nazis. How did the swastika become a Nazi symbol? Heinrich Schliemann's discovery of Troy in the 1870s set in motion the events that transformed the swastika, a symbol of fortune and hope for thousands of years, into a hated and feared sign of fascism. He concluded it to be a \"significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors\" when he unearthed 1,800 examples, but his colleague, Emile-Louis Burnouf, thought differently. Knowing the symbol appeared in India, Burnouf studied a sacred Hindu text called the Rigveda and claimed to have found a connection between the swastika and an enigmatic ancient people, the Aryans. Burnouf studied a sacred Hindu text called the Rigveda and claimed to have found a connection between the swastika and an enigmatic ancient people, the Aryans Supposedly, this 'master race' of white-skinned warriors constituted the peak of human civilisation, conquering lands such as India and bringing the swastika with them. The word Aryan itself derived from Sanskrit, like svastika. Pots from the sixth-century had been found in Germany with swastikas on them and scholars noted the similarities between Sanskrit and German as further proof that the Aryans had come from Germany. But the whole notion of this 'pure' race, as well as being deeply racist, was based on a misunderstanding. The Sanskrit word for Aryan ( rya) actually meant \"honourable, respectable or noble\" and referred to a social or linguistic distinction, not a separate ethnic group. Before the Nazis, the swastika was widely adopted in the West as a symbol of luck and fortune (Photo by Rykoff Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) But the theory of the Aryans  existence grew in popularity from the mid-19th century. The unification of Germany in 1871, the same year Schliemann started work at Troy, led to a swell of uninhibited nationalism in the country and the idea that Germans descended from Aryans. To them, the discovery at Troy of their symbol, the swastika, proved they had been a dominant race. So while the swastika existed as a benign good-luck charm across Europe and North America, it simultaneously became an icon for German nationalists and anti-Semitic groups. What is the swastika a symbol of today? In the aftermath of World War II, publicly displaying the swastika was banned in Germany, where it remains illegal. Yet while reviled in the Western world, it continues to be a potent symbol with far-right and white-supremacist groups. In the US, where its use is permitted, incidents involving swastika flags and graffiti have increased in recent years, most infamously when neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. It can be seen seemingly everywhere in parts of the Indian subcontinent   from temple entrances to the front of taxis   and plays an important role in ceremonies and festivals But the swastika also remains a feature of worship for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. It can be seen seemingly everywhere in parts of the Indian subcontinent   from temple entrances to the front of taxis   and plays an important role in ceremonies and festivals. During Diwali   the Hindu festival of lights   the swastika is drawn with coloured sand, or rangoli, and depicted with lanterns to celebrate the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. In 2007, when German politicians attempted to introduce a swastika ban across the European Union, Hindus vehemently opposed the measure on religious grounds. Swastikas are drawn in coloured sand during Diwali celebrations (Photo by Shashi Sharma/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) Such disparate attitudes towards the swastika raises the question of whether the symbol   which for so long has been a force for good   can be reclaimed from its association with Hitler and the neo-Nazis who still display it. Would reclaiming the symbol mark the final defeat of the Third Reich and the hatred it advocated? Or is that impossible? The 20th-century corruption of the swastika came to represent so much of the horrors of Nazism that it should never be forgotten. Ad The answer, although not a neat one, may be that there will always be two utterly conflicting interpretations of the swastika, both of which are part of our history, present and future: one representing the worst of humanity and the other symbolising the best.",

        "content": "What was the Beer Hall Putsch? On 8 November 1923, Adolf Hitler strode into a beer hall, jumped on to a chair, and fired a single bullet into the ceiling. Ad  The National Revolution has begun,  he bellowed to his startled audience.  The hall is under the control of 600 heavily armed men. No one is allowed to leave.  It was the most dramatic of entrances, and one that would signal the start of a defining episode in Hitler s early life: the Munich beer hall putsch. A speaker addresses a crowd in Marienplatz, Munich during the beer hall putsch. Hitler planned to seize the Bavarian city before leading a march on Berlin. (Photo by Shutterstock) Hitler s aim that autumn night was to seize Munich and use the city as a base from which to overthrow the Weimar Republic. Yet little did he know as stood on top of the table that his  national revolution  was about to fall flat on its face. Why did the putsch take place in a beer hall? Hitler had chosen the location of his coup   the B rgerbr ukeller, a large beer hall in the centre of Munich   for a good reason. For it was here, on that November evening, that Gustav von Kahr, state commissioner of Bavaria, was due to deliver a speech to Munich government officials. Hitler, who had been leader of the National Socialist German Workers  Party (better known to history as the Nazis) since July 1921, decided to hijack this meeting to announce a  March on Berlin , where he planned to have himself installed as German leader. He had already won over the First World War leader General Erich Ludendorff   and assumed that Kahr and the Bavarian establishment would support him, too. What Hitler did not know was that, on 6 November, Kahr had met leading paramilitary organisations in Munich, telling them the Bavarian government would not support any revolutionary action designed to bring down the Weimar Republic. General Otto von Lossow, head of the Bavarian Reichswehr, and Colonel Hans Ritter von Seisser, the head of the Bavarian State Police, also opposed Hitler s proposed coup. On the podcast | Everything you wanted to know about the Weimar Germany What happened duing the Beer Hall Putsch? In the minutes following Hitler s entrance into the beer hall, Kahr was barely in a position to oppose the Nazis swarming into the building. Standing at the speaker s podium, he was led at gunpoint to an adjoining room, accompanied by Seisser, Lossow and Ernst P hner, the former Munich chief of police. Hitler threatened to kill them and himself, too, if they refused to join his march on the German capital. In the meantime, Ludendorff had turned up, telling Kahr, Sesser and Lossow that he supported Hitler s plan. However, Ludendorff was somewhat surprised to hear that, in Hitler s proposed national government, he had been given the lesser role of commander of the army, as Hitler had already appointed himself  dictator of Germany . At 10.30pm, Hitler left the beer hall to go and calm down a clash between an SA paramilitary unit and government troops at the local barracks of the Army Engineers a few miles away. He left Ludendorff to control Kahr, Lossow and Seisser. It was a huge error of judgment: Ludendorff had soon allowed the three to leave. Members of the SA arrive at the Munich beer hall during the putsch. Tensions between Nazi militia and the Bavarian police soon erupted into violence. (Photo by Presse-Illustrationen Heinrich Hoffmann/ ullstein bild) Once free, Kahr took measures to strangle Hitler s would-be revolution at birth. German president, Friedrich Ebert, gave full executive power over Bavaria to General von Seeckt, who issued a manifesto warning that the army would deal sternly with all conspirators. And so, a few minutes before midnight, Hitler accepted that his attempt to overthrow Weimar democracy had failed. Yet he wasn t about to go quietly into the night. As a final and futile revolutionary gesture, the following day the Nazi leader led a demonstration, numbering 3,000, through Munich, with Ludendorff at his side. Their aim was to march to the War Ministry and capture it, but as they approached the Feldherrnhalle, in the city centre, they found their path barred by a heavily armed cordon of the Bavarian state police. Several shots were fired on both sides. It left 14 National Socialists and four police officers dead. What happened after the Beer Hall Putsch? When it was all over, Hitler turned up at the house of his close friend, the wealthy landowner Ernst  Putzi  Hanfstaengl. It didn t take the authorities long to catch up with him. On 11 November, Hitler was arrested and driven to Landsberg Fortress, a modern prison 33 miles to the west of Munich, to await trial on a charge of treason. Why did the Beer Hall Putsch fail? The coup had failed because Hitler allowed his party to become a purely paramilitary organisation, involved in an ill-defined conspiracy. Hitler had whipped up his own supporters into a frenzy, only to find that he had already been deserted by his supposed co-conspirators. On the day of Hitler s arrest, Gustav Stresemann, the German chancellor, gave a speech in which he reflected on recent events in Munich, admitting:  Germany was now confronted with the demand for a dictatorship.  But he stressed that anyone thinking a dictatorship would improve matters was making a  great mistake . Stresemann said a  destructive force  such as Hitler could never have provided competent government for Germany, even if he had succeeded. But, of course, Hitler hadn t succeeded. His coup had ended in abject failure. What happened to Hitler after the Beer Hall Putsch? As his trial got under way at Munich s First District People s Court, on 26 February 1924, his political career now seemingly lay in tatters, his dreams of seizing power cast to the wind. A long prison sentence surely awaited. A photograph of the beer hall putsch trial at Munich s People s Court. (Photo by INTERFOTO/TopFoto) Yet Hitler wasn t quite finished yet. That much became apparent on 27 March 1924 when, after four weeks of worldwide press coverage of his trial, he delivered his closing speech. It lasted for more than an hour and would be remembered as one of the most important of his life. Hitler began by saying the Weimar Republic was founded on a  crime of high treason  in which the German army had been  stabbed in the back  by socialists and Jews. As the country suffered one catastrophe after another, the democratic leaders of the republic remained, he argued, subservient to the Allied powers. Germany was reduced to a pawn on the international chessboard. The Treaty of Versailles was, Hitler raged,  immorality in 440 clauses . As for the League of Nations, its only function was to guarantee the  corrupt peace treaty . Now, this  so-called government was hauling German heroes into court and branding them traitors . Respect for law would only return when the president of Germany was tried for high treason. Looking straight at the judge, Hitler concluded his speech, with the following statement:  Even if you pronounce us guilty a thousand times, the eternal goddess of the eternal court of history will smilingly tear up the verdict of this court and she will acquit us.  Hitler had undoubtedly seized his moment in the international spotlight. In that court in central Munich he had somehow turned a bungled fiasco into a triumph. On 1 April, Georg Neithardt, a nationalist member of the rightwing Bavarian judiciary, delivered the verdicts. Hitler was found guilty of high treason and sentenced to five years, with a reduction for the four months he had already served. This made him eligible for release on parole after just six months. He also received a fine of 200 gold marks. The other chief defendant in the trial, General Erich Ludendorff   who arrived to hear the verdicts in full general s regalia, displaying all his medals   was amazingly acquitted of all charges. What was the impact of the Beer Hall Putsch? News of the verdicts shocked not only the German press, but newspapers around the world. The leading SPD newspaper, Vorw rts, condemned the trial as  a farce and a mockery , suggesting it was such an obvious injustice that the judge should be put on trial himself. The Times asked if the crime of high treason was  worth more than a mere six months in prison? , and The New York Times regarded the verdicts as  an excellent joke for All Fools  Day . Far from snuffing out Hitler s political aspirations, the trial had provided him with the oxygen of global publicity. It had made him famous. To many, he was no longer the buffoon who had botched a coup in a beer hall, but a true patriot who tried to rescue Germany from democratic chaos. Hitler s time in prison also led him to begin writing Mein Kampf (My Struggle), which became the  Bible of National Socialism , in which he cast himself in the role of political and philosophical Messiah. Part autobiography, part ideological manifesto and part blueprint for political action, Mein Kampf remains an important book for understanding the essence of Nazi ideology, crystallising his virulent hatred for Jewish people and Marxists and setting out his living space in eastern Europe. Nazism s sacred text How Hitler used his time in prison to produce a chilling political manifesto, Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler spent just eight months and 20 days incarcerated in Landsberg Fortress for his part in the Munich beer hall putsch. To many onlookers, he had been handed a mystifyingly lenient punishment for an audacious act of treason. Yet that was time enough for the Nazi leader to refine his political ideology, formulate his future plans for Germany and begin committing them to paper. The result was a 782-page manifesto published over two volumes. Hitler called it Mein Kampf (My Struggle). The first volume of Mein Kampf presents a heavily redacted autobiographical story from Hitler s early life up to the founding of the National Socialist Party (NSDAP) in February 1920. The second volume, written after his release, was more of a political manifesto, developing many of the ideas he mentioned in the first volume, but in more detail. The dominant theoretical concepts in both volumes are race and space. Hitler depicts human history not as a class struggle, as Marx would have it, but a Darwinian struggle for existence between the strong and pure  Aryan  races over the  weak and mixed-race  ones. The key objective of Hitler s racial policy is to create a pure Aryan folk community of Germans, which he called Volksgemeinschaft. This  master race  would then become  the highest species of humanity on this Earth . If the Aryan possessed all the positive qualities Hitler ad- mired, the opposite was true of the two key enemies he outlined in Mein Kampf: Jews and Marxists. A virulent hatred of Marxism runs through many pages in the book. Hitler s chief desire if he gained power was to  eliminate  or  exterminate  Marxism in German politics. There is a similar passionate and violent hatred of Jews, especially in the chapter  Nation and Race , in the first volume. Hitler defined Jews, not as a religious group, but as a united race planning a  world conspiracy . A large amount of space in Mein Kampf is devoted to foreign policy. Hitler had entered politics to demand the end of the Treaty of Versailles, primarily by settling accounts with France, thereby restoring Germany s 1914 borders. This implied a future war concentrated in western Europe. Yet the revision of the Treaty of Versailles was to be a mere prelude to gaining living space in eastern Europe. In Mein Kampf, Hitler sets out his belief that the Soviet Union had been militarily weakened by being under the control of  Jewish-Bolsheviks . It was, he concluded,  ripe for collapse , and would be subjugated through a war of conquest. Read more | Mein Kampf: what happened to Hitler s money after his death? At 12.15pm on 20 December 1924, Hitler walked out of Landsburg Fortress. The New York Times ran an article to coincide with his release under the headline:  Hitler Tamed by Prison.  The paper reported that the  demi-god of reactionary extremists  looked much wiser as he left prison, noting that his behaviour during imprisonment had convinced the authorities he was no longer to be feared.  It is believed he will retire to private life and return to Austria, the country of his birth.  Hitler was, of course, planning nothing of the sort. While in prison, he had spent his time assessing his failure, learning from it, and, above all, formulating his next move on the political stage. He concluded that, to succeed, National Socialism needed a clear ideology and a national organisation   and that the path to power lay through votes in elections, not brute force. Put that way, the Munich Beer Hall Putsch marked the birth of Hitler as a politician, and the end of his career as a beer-hall agitator. It was the true start of his road to power.

Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert is elected its first president the following February. 29 July 1921 Adolf Hitler becomes leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, which will later be better known as the Nazi Party. 11 January 1923 French and Belgian troops occupy the Rhur to enforce payment of German reparations. 8 November 1923 Hitler leads the Munich beer hall putsch. He is jailed for his role in the bungled coup, and it is in prison that begins writing Mein Kampf. 26 April 1925 The First World War military leader Paul von Hindenburg is elected Reich president. 29 October 1929 Wall Street crashes, contributing to the Great Depression, which will see more than 6 million Germans unemployed. 29 March 1930 Hindenburg appoints Heinrich Br ning as chancellor of a  Presidential Cabinet  that uses Article 28 of the Weimar Constitution to remain in power. 14 September 1930 The Nazis win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 seats in national elections. March/April 1932 Hitler makes a strong showing in the German presidential election but is defeated by Paul von Hindenburg. 31 July 1932 The Nazis poll 37.4 per cent in the national elections to become the largest party in the Reichstag. 28 January 1933 Following a wave of resignations and votes of no confidence, Kurt von Schleicher resigns as chancellor, paving the way for Hitler s ascent to power. 30 January 1933 Hindenburg appoints Hitler chancellor of Germany, believing   mistakenly, as it turns out   that the Nazi leader can be controlled.

        "content": "In 1943 the fortunes of war began to turn against Nazi Germany. Early that year, the battle of Stalingrad   widely hailed as a turning point in the Second World War   inaugurated a long, steady advance by the Red Army on the eastern front. This was interrupted only briefly by the battle of Kursk, the largest tank battle in history, which the Germans lost comprehensively. Ad In the south, Hitler s Italian ally, Benito Mussolini, was deposed in July 1943 after the Allies launched their invasion of Sicily. The Germans now felt obliged to occupy mainland Italy, diverting much-needed troops from the east, but were steadily beaten back by the Allies from September onwards. The end of July saw the mass bombing of Hamburg, with the damage inflicted on German cities by Allied raids becoming ever more severe. All the while, morale on the home front began to fall, and the Nazi Party, the Gestapo and the SS started to tighten the screws of the repression that had played such an important part in creating the regime in the first place. Active Nazis rejoiced in the return, as they saw it, of the  time of struggle , the old days before the Third Reich was securely established, when they were fighting against their enemies, real or imagined, on all sides. Read more | Should we be glad the 1944 July Plot to kill Hitler failed? By 1944 growing numbers of middle-ranking army officers, backed by a few more senior figures, had become so despairing of victory that they were plotting to remove Adolf Hitler and sue for peace   a futile enterprise, since the Allies had agreed to demand unconditional surrender early the previous year. On 20 July 1944, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg detonated a time-bomb in Hitler s eastern headquarters, but it didn t kill the Nazi dictator and the coup failed. Already suspicious of the armed forces and contemptuous of their leadership, Hitler now lost all faith in them. They were either cowards or traitors. Willpower was what mattered in his view, willpower would conquer everything, and willpower was precisely what they lacked. On the podcast | Frank McDonough discusses how Nazi Germany fell from the peak of its power in 1940 to disastrous defeat A failed miracle In a desperate attempt to shore up morale, the manufacture of  miracle weapons  was trumpeted by Joseph Goebbels  propaganda apparatus, including nerve gases, flying bombs, ground-to-air missiles, rockets, air-conditioned submarines and even an atom bomb. Hitler placed particular faith in the effects of a jet-engine fighter plane, the Messerschmitt Me 262, but it had little impact on fighting before the end of the war. These projects dissipated resources too widely, and depended on supplies of raw materials that were already drying up. Hitler ordered a concentration on the V1 flying bomb and the V2 rocket, but they could not be manufactured in sufficient quantities to have a major impact. Moreover, the fact that the  V  stood for Vergeltung,  retribution , amounted to a confession that they were unlikely to change the course of the war. For a while, however, they gave at least some encouragement to Hitler s faithful that the tide could still be turned. The public, as the SS reported, were increasingly sceptical. Read more | Reporting on Hitler: how foreign correspondents in Nazi Germany battled to expose the truth In these final months, Hitler looked to history for inspiration. The call-up of men previously exempted from military service, above all because they were too young or too old, into the Volkssturm (People s Storm) deliberately echoed the legendary popular mobilisation in Prussia against Napoleon Bonaparte. The official date for the launch of the Volkssturm, 18 October 1944, was the anniversary of Napoleon s defeat at Leipzig in 1813. Goebbels also commissioned and released an expensive new colour movie, Kolberg, telling the fictionalised story of a decision by the people of a town besieged by Napoleon to fight on to the bitter end whatever the cost. It was an implicit invitation to the Germans of Hitler s day to sacrifice themselves in what was claimed to be the national interest. It had little impact, since it had a very limited release. The movie also wasted precious resources of manpower for the military scenes, which involved thousands of men who might otherwise have been fighting at the front. The Volkssturm itself, poorly equipped and badly trained, was largely pointless except as a propaganda exercise: 175,000 men and boys were killed before the war came to an end. Read more | The stomach for the fight: the food policies used by the Nazis to maintain control in the Third Reich On 16 December 1944, Hitler attempted a last throw of the dice, launching a fresh offensive in the west, where he believed that he could repeat the triumph of 1940 in the Ardennes   another piece of historical wishful thinking. Some 200,000 troops and large quantities of armour and equipment were transferred to the battle of the Bulge, largely from the eastern front. When Hitler s acting army chief of staff, Heinz Guderian, told him that the situation on the eastern front was at breaking point, and that it was folly to divert troops to the west, the dictator screamed:  You don t need to lecture me! I ve been leading the German armies in the field for five years  I m better informed than you are!  If the troops believed in victory, Hitler told his adjutant Nicolaus von Below, then victory would be theirs. To begin with, the German armies scored some successes, enthusing Hitler with a fresh confidence, before the overwhelming superiority of the Allies brought them to a halt. The net effect in the end was to weaken the German defences in the east. After the Ardennes offensive was broken, Hitler told Below:  I know the war is lost. The enemy s superiority is too great.  He had been let down by the Luftwaffe and betrayed by traitors in the army.  We won t surrender, never. We can go under. But we ll take a world with us.  Death and destruction were all he could think of in his hour of despair. People pick their way through the ruins of Hamburg following Allied bombing, 1943 (Photo by Keystone/Getty Images) Conspiracy theories As one defeat followed another, Hitler began to isolate himself from the German masses, ceasing his visits to the front and refusing to go to the cities to talk to the civilians who had been bombed out of their homes. Once more, he blamed everything that had, in his mind, gone wrong with Germany since the First World War on  the Jewish-international global conspiracy , in which latterly Franklin D Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill had been no more than willing puppets. He still insisted on continued uncompromising resistance. When Warsaw was evacuated by the retreating German army, he lost his temper and had the staff officers who had issued the retreat signals arrested by the Gestapo. A crack SS division, the Leibstandarte, suffered heavy losses in its defence of the Hungarian oilfields, and was rewarded for its defeat by Hitler s sending SS chief Heinrich Himmler to strip its surviving soldiers of their armbands, a very public humiliation that caused some of the troops to shoot themselves. Hitler did not care. By insisting on fighting to the end, he sacrificed the lives of millions of his soldiers. More than a third of all German troops killed during the war died in January to May 1945, when it was clear to most Germans that the war was already lost. By insisting on fighting to the end, Hitler sacrificed the lives of millions of his soldiers. More than a third of all German troops killed during the war died in January to May 1945 The destruction of German towns and cities from the air was turning more and more of them into heaps of rubble. Power cuts and water shortages became more frequent with the destruction of gas and electricity generating plants, power lines and underground pipes. More than half a million civilians were killed in the raids. Living conditions began to worsen. In the autumn of 1944, for the first time, the Nazi authorities began to make serious reductions of food and other rations. The supply situation steadily deteriorated from now on, and was not to recover until many months after the end of the war. On 19 March 1945, Hitler issued the infamous  Nero order , commanding local authorities and plant managers to destroy their facilities in the face of the Allied advance in order to prevent them from being used by the enemy. The order, however, was widely disobeyed by local authorities, encouraged by armaments minister Albert Speer. After reading a memorandum Speer had presented to him rejecting the order because the German people would need the basic necessities if they were to survive after the war, Hitler told him that it was not necessary to worry about the German people,  for the nation has proved to be the weaker, and the future belongs solely to the stronger eastern nation. In any case only those who are inferior will remain after this struggle, for the good have already been killed.

To begin with, he climbed the stairs to the garden quite frequently to walk his dog, Blondi, and on 20 March 1945 he went up to inspect and decorate a small detachment of Hitler Youth who had been defending the city. But as the Red Army moved into Berlin, it became too dangerous. On 20 April, his 56th birthday, he went up for the last time; a further attempt to come out, a week later, was frustrated by Soviet shelling. Inside the bunker, the foul air and failing latrine system were beginning to make life unbearable. The celebration of Hitler s birthday in the bunker was muted, with Hitler himself participating only reluctantly. Outside on the surface, the dull thuds of Soviet artillery fire could already be heard, the noise penetrating through the thick concrete into the room. By this time, Hitler had almost wholly lost touch with reality. He continued in his daily military conferences to move little flags representing army divisions around Berlin on a map, ordering a tank unit led by Felix Steiner, a senior SS officer, to launch a counter-attack, supported by aircraft and infantry, in which he expected that  the Russians will suffer the greatest defeat, the bloodiest defeat in their history before the gates of the city of Berlin . But the troops and the tanks simply didn t exist. Told the attack had not taken place, Hitler lost all self-control, screaming that the army   and now, too, the SS   had betrayed him. Everything was lost, he cried, shaking with rage. Hermann G ring must negotiate a peace deal with the Allies. He would stay in the bunker and take his own life. Informed by telephone of Hitler s breakdown, Goebbels moved into the bunker with his wife and children, determined to stay with him until the end, then create a heroic myth, just as he had tried to do after Stalingrad, of self-sacrifice for posterity. Hitler s breakdown on 22 April 1945 inaugurated the final act in the squalid and pointless drama being played out in the bunker. At last, the spell broken, his lieutenants, with the exception of Goebbels, began to desert him. Told of Hitler s rant, G ring sent a telegram to Berlin assuming his rights as his nominated successor unless he heard otherwise. Hitler had already lost faith in him because of the failure of the Luftwaffe, and now he reacted by instructing the Reich Marshal to resign all his offices. Within a few hours, G ring was under house arrest, an SS unit stationed outside his house. Worse than any of this, Hitler discovered that Himmler had been negotiating with neutral Sweden behind his back for Germany s surrender to be conveyed to the Allies. Declaring this to be  the most shameful betrayal in human history , Hitler dismissed him from all his offices. Red Army troops run through Berlin during the storming of the Reichstag in April 1945 (Photo by dpa picture alliance / Alamy Stock Photo) Death in a bunker On 29 April 1945, after being shown photographs of Mussolini s corpse, hanging upside-down from a petrol station gantry next to that of his mistress, Clara Petacci, Hitler told his staff over dinner that he was determined to avoid a similar fate. His body was to be burned until no trace of it remained, he said. Summoning a local Berlin official to the bunker, he now underwent a formal, legal ceremony of marriage with Eva Braun. Dictating his last will and testament, he appointed Grand Admiral Karl D nitz as his successor, and blamed the bombing of German cities on the Jews, who he believed were steering the Allies from behind. They had been forced to  expiate their guilt, though through more humane means . Such an admission expressed a belief that the gas chambers of Auschwitz and other extermination camps were a  humane  method of killing, as well as a feeling of triumph that, with the Holocaust, he had exacted on the Jews what he imagined to be a justified revenge. Privately, Hitler admitted to his secretary Traudl Junge that  National Socialism is dead . Unrestrained in his boundless egotism, he told her that the Germans had not been ready to carry out the tasks he had allotted to them. On 30 April 1945, after saying farewell once more to his secretaries, Hitler retired with Eva to his study at half-past three in the afternoon. A few minutes later a single shot was fired. Gingerly opening the door, Hitler s valet, Heinz Linge, saw the dictator s lifeless body slumped on the sofa, blood oozing from a gunshot wound in his right temple. Eva Braun (now Hitler) was beside him, a strong smell of bitter almonds coming from her corpse. She had taken cyanide. Linge and Hitler s adjutant, Otto G nsche, wrapped the bodies in blankets and, with the help of SS guards, carried them up the long staircases to the Reich Chancellery garden, where they doused them with petrol and set them alight. So thoroughly were the bodies burned that only the teeth remained among the ashes, later to be identified by a technician who had worked for Hitler s dentist. The American military newspaper The Stars and Stripes announces the f hrer s death on 2 May 1945 (Photo by Peter Horree / Alamy Stock Photo) Public executions Hitler left only death and destruction behind him. Many ordinary Germans had gradually lost faith in his regime as defeat followed defeat, and life in Germany s devastated cities had progressively become more difficult for them to sustain. Instead of being restored to greatness, as Hitler had proclaimed, the country lay in ruins. Yet there had been no general rising against the regime. By the last months, any kind of dereliction of duty, open defeatism, or attempt to negotiate a local surrender to the advancing Allied forces incurred public execution at the hands of the SS and other fanatics. Many Germans carried on resisting the enemy out of fear of what might happen to them, justified enough in the case of the Red Army, whose troops carried out innumerable shootings and rapes of civilians as they advanced into Germany. By 1945 most Germans were motivated above all by nationalism, the feeling that what they were defending was their country rather than the Nazi regime that had taken it over. Civil servants and administrators continued with their daily bureaucratic routines more out of a sense of duty or ingrained habit than anything else. Hitler s charismatic authority endured almost to the end. More than a decade of his rule had left people unable to imagine life without him   in thousands of cases literally so, as a huge wave of suicides rolled across Germany, particularly among government ministers, generals and Nazi Party officials. When Hitler s death became known, and the war ended, allegiance to the Third Reich among the people of Germany vanished almost overnight.

        "content": "(Meet the powerful yokai that inspired the demon king in  Demon Slayer ) In Mesopotamia during the 1st millennium B.C., purveyors of magic called a ipu staved off and expelled demons that brought illness and chaos. As spiritual healers, a ipu were esteemed protectors who used amulets, performed elaborate rituals and, when needed, engaged helper demon figures in their efforts. The ancient Greek word daimon from which the modern  demon  derives referred to god-like spirits and supernatural forces. While a daimon could be good or evil, the latter was a malevolent force that needed to be cast out or exorcized. The 1st century A.D. historian Flavius Josephus recounted the story of Eleazar, a man who freed others from a demon by drawing it out of his nostrils and repeatedly invoking King Solomon s name, attesting to a form of exorcism in Jewish tradition as well. (The wealthy, wise reign of King Solomon made Israel prosper) This bronze Mesopotamian booklet presents an ancient exorcism and is housed at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Photograph by Photo Josse, Bridgeman Image Christianity and exorcism With the growth of Christianity during the first three centuries A.D., the established themes of the rite found even stronger footing. Possession and exorcism became a means to unite the Christian faithful and vindicate their beliefs in the wake of religious persecution. (In Zanzibar, a traditional herbalist exorcises evil spirits) The spread of Christianity meant paganism took on an evil connotation, transforming non-Christian beliefs into something that needed to be exorcized. As a result, renouncing paganism as an evil became a requirement for baptism into the Christian faith. Falling back under the influence of a pagan belief was, therefore, akin to possession. Exorcism in this context was a voluntary mechanism used to strengthen both the Christian faith and the Christian community. (Biblical stories of Jesus  birth reveal intriguing clues about his times) Exorcism served to legitimize Christianity and, by the 4th century A.D., found extensive use in pre-baptismal contexts. Converts and aspiring Christians underwent daily morning exorcism in the lead up to baptism. On the day of baptism, a bishop literally blew evil influences off of them through a process called exsufflation. In the moments before being baptized, the individual was anointed with oil that had itself been exorcized. (What does it take to become a saint in the modern age?) Outside of baptism, churchmen carried out exorcism by laying hands on the possessed while commanding evil spirits to leave their bodies. Christians in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages could exorcize themselves, so to speak, by calling on a saint as an intercessor, going to a shrine, and appealing for aid from a sacred entity to get closer to God and further away from evil.",

The word itself is peculiar, yet it s now an almost universal sign of the supposedly impossible. While experts debate the exact origins of abracadabra, the word is undeniably ancient. Abracadabra first appears in the writings of Quintus Serenus Sammonicus more than 1,800 years ago as a magical remedy for fever, a potentially fatal development in an age before antibiotics and a symptom of malaria. He was a tutor to the children who became the Roman emperors Geta and Caracalla, and his privileged position in a wealthy noble family added importance to his words. Writing in in the second century A.D. in a book called Liber Medicinalis ( Book of Medicine ), Serenus advised making an amulet containing parchment inscribed with the magical word, to be hung around the neck of a sufferer. He prescribed that the word be written on subsequent lines, but in a downwards-pointing triangle with one less letter each time, as shown in the image above.",

The succession-driven plot sounds like a real-life Game of Thrones, but the mystery of how archaeologists unraveled it three millennia later would be at home on any detective show. What historians knew is that the conspiracy had pitted two of the pharaoh s children the sons of Tyti and Tiye against one another. But the details of the plot and whether it had actually succeeded in killing the pharaoh remained one of the most intriguing cold cases in history until modern archaeology helped solve it. What really happened to Ramesses III (also known as Ramses III), pharaoh of a doomed ancient empire?

        "content": "If Edda Ciano were to rescue her husband, she would have to do what no one else dared: she would have to blackmail Adolf Hitler. Ad  F hrer,  she wrote in a letter dated 10 January 1944,  for some time the documents have been in the hands of persons who are authorised to use them in case anything should happen to my husband . She gave Hitler three days to release Galeazzo Ciano, or she would publish the Italian s private diaries. It was a gambit as unlikely as it was daring. A young German spy named Hilde Beetz had already been sent to seduce her husband and learn the location of the documents. That spy s mission had already produced results. But what Hitler could not know was that in the final months of 1943, the young spy assigned to beguile Galeazzo Ciano in a prison cell had fallen in love with her target and was, even now, helping Edda to deliver her brazen blackmail message. Why did Hitler want Galeazzo Ciano's diaries? So, who was Galeazzo Ciano, and why were his diaries of such interest to Hitler? Galeazzo Ciano had been, until the previous summer, Benito Mussolini s foreign minister and political heir-apparent. Crucially, he was also Mussolini s son-in-law. Edda Ciano, n e Edda Mussolini, was the headstrong favourite child of Il Duce. Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini in 1938, with Galeazzo Ciano seen just to Hitler s right. Germany and Italy would enter a new political and military alliance the following year, dubbed the  Pact of Steel . (Image by Getty Images) As Mussolini s foreign minister, Galeazzo Ciano had been privy to secret conversations between Germany and Italy, and by 1942, became ever more convinced that joining the Axis powers had been a grave mistake. Determined to act, he began secret negotiations with the Allies and sought to remove Italy from the war. When that failed, he reached out to Allied intelligence, attempting to broker a separate peace. After that, too, failed, he joined a plot to remove his father-in-law from power in the summer of 1943, and, for a few weeks   until Hitler liberated Mussolini from his mountain-top prison   Ciano and his co-conspirators succeeded. In the autumn of 1943, Hitler restored Mussolini to power as the head of a puppet state in northern Italy, which came to be known as the Italian Social Republic, or Sal  Republic. The Ciano family attempted to flee to South America, but were detained and sent home. Mussolini understood that he was expected to deal with his treacherous son-in-law in a show trial for treason. The verdict was always going to be  guilty . When the trial began on 8 January 1944, Galeazzo Ciano s attorney was persuaded to resign, and the public defender was comically incompetent. But it did not matter   the whole affair was nothing more than a charade. When the inevitable verdict was announced two days later, a plea for clemency was sent to Mussolini, and that night he was heard pacing sleeplessly waiting for the appeal. He had already half-decided to commute the sentence for the sake of his daughter, but the request for clemency never reached him. A senior member of Mussolini s Fascist Party, afraid that the dictator would waver, withheld the letter until Galeazzo Ciano had been executed on the morning of 11 January. Edda Ciano and Hilde Beetz did not, of course, know of those palace intrigues. All they knew during the trial was that there would only be a narrow window between the verdict and the firing squad. It might be hours; it might be a day or two. And Edda no longer believed that her father would be moved by appeals for mercy. She knew, though, what might move him: the papers. German spy Hilde Beetz, pictured here in 1953, was tasked with finding out where Galeazzo Ciano had hidden his diaries. (Image Public Domain) The  Ciano Diaries  recorded the inner workings of a fascist strategy that he now renounced, along with its ugliest diplomatic secrets. And since at least 1942, the diaries had been seriously aggravating Hitler.  I don t understand,  Hitler fumed privately,  how Mussolini can make war with a foreign minister who doesn t want it and who keeps diaries in which he says nasty things about Nazism and its leaders . The Gestapo was, even now, hunting for Edda and the missing papers. On the podcast | Judy Batalion describes how a group of young Jewish women fought back against their Nazi oppressors in occupied Poland A rescue bid Despite Hilde s feelings for Galeazzo Ciani, Edda was prepared to set emotional complications aside in a bid to save her husband s life. Aided by Edda s wartime lover, Emilio Pucci, the two women teamed up and concocted a plan to smuggle Edda and the diaries over the border to neutral Switzerland, where they would make contact with British intelligence. Before crossing the frontier, Edda wrote the aforementioned letter to Hitler, along with a letter to her father, threatening to publish the diaries unless her husband was released from prison. She handed the blackmail letters (both post-dated to 10 January) to Emilio, so he could pass them to Hilde. Hilde would then see that they reached the two dictators. Emilio gave Edda a loaded pistol and warned her to shoot anyone who tried to stop her On the evening of 9 January, Emilio gave Edda a loaded pistol, warned her to shoot anyone who tried to stop her   and to shoot herself if they captured her   and watched as she disappeared into the woods with several volumes of her husband s diaries wrapped around her waist in a belt made of pyjamas. When she arrived at the Swiss side of the border, the impression that she was heavily pregnant prevented her being searched by agents. Galeazzo Ciano (centre) pictured at the Berghof, Hitler s Bavarian chalet, in 1942. In secret, he opposed the war. (Image by Getty Images) Having seen Edda off, Emilio rushed to Verona to deliver her letters, with the intention of returning to the border to flee himself. Instead, he was captured and tortured by the Gestapo. Hilde, feeling responsible for the debacle, persuaded her supervisor that if she could take Emilio to Switzerland, he would help them  trap  Edda and get the diaries. In reality, of course, they would ensure Edda and the diaries made it safely to Britain. However, as soon as the pair arrived in Switzerland, Emilio collapsed on the street from head trauma, making their incognito operations impossible. He was then hospitalised with a fractured skull and later interned as an Italian prisoner of war. Meanwhile, Edda   a very unwelcome refugee in Switzerland   was incarcerated in a convent, with no access to outside information. She was still in possession of the diaries, and still hunted by the Gestapo. Hiding in Switzerland On 14 January, an Italian diplomat travelled to Edda s convent, where he informed her that her husband had been executed three days earlier. It was crushing news   a revelation that caused her to howl in grief and fury   but she was still keen to ensure that the diaries were published. With Hilde now undercover as a German consular secretary in Switzerland, the trio attempted to contact British intelligence to arrange the delivery of the manuscripts, and to negotiate Edda s passage to safety. Already, there were German plans in the works to kidnap her, obtain the location of the diaries, and ensure her permanent silence. Galeazzo and Edda Ciano pictured in 1935. Edda was the daughter of Benito Mussolini, under whom Galeazzo served as foreign minister between 1936 and 1943. (Image by Getty Images) Frustratingly, though, the British agent on the ground in Bern   perceiving that Hilde was a German operative and suspecting a set-up aimed at revealing his identity   could not be drawn. Things were looking bleak: Hilde was unable to renew a Swiss visa and about to be deported; Emilio was still recovering from a cracked skull; and it was only a matter of time before Hitler s henchmen discovered Edda s location. Fortunately, the trio had a lucky break. The presence of Edda and Emilio in Switzerland came to the attention of an American government man in Bern named Allen Dulles, whose covert assignment was the operation of the newly founded Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS already had some information about the diaries, and was keen to obtain them for the Allies. Not only might the documents help shape public perceptions about the war, but the Allies were already looking ahead to what would become   after the conflict had ended   the trials at Nuremberg. The race was on. A mountain mission Allen Dulles  first thought was to send in a professional intelligence agent, Cordelia Dodson, who had attended university with Emilio, to see if she could obtain the materials. He soon realised, however, that a more expedient route was available: in Fribourg there was a country house, locally known as the  House of Spies , where the American and British intelligence communities socialised, along with a select group of other European agents. The hostess, an American banker s wife named Frances de Chollet, was friends with the Italian heiress Virginia Agnelli and her daughters, who were themselves friends of Edda and Emilio. Keen to exploit this connection, Allen Dulles activated Frances as an  accidental  (amateur) agent and tasked her with befriending Edda and persuading her to trust the Americans with her late husband s papers. To facilitate the clandestine  girls  lunches  between the two women, the OSS provided Frances with a sporty race car to cross the mountain pass to the psychiatric clinic where Edda was now living in secret. It was fortunate that they did   and that Frances was an excellent and experienced race car driver. Because, when Edda ultimately did agree to allow the OSS to photograph the papers, the equipment blew the fuses inside the building. Galeazzo Ciano in prison in Verona, where he was tried and eventually sentenced to death for treason. (Image by Getty Images) Fearing that the clinic would discover what was happening   and that Edda would be sent back to Italy, and her certain death   it was decided that Frances would drive Edda and the diaries across the mountains to photograph the diaries on Frances  kitchen table. The plan worked: the intelligence team photographed the diaries, page by page, into the early morning hours. Then, just before dawn, Frances drove Edda back to the clinic at high speed and helped her sneak back in through a window. What began as an amateur spy mission ended up in a bond that would last after the war ended. Later, Edda would fondly recall  that little trip , especially how the two women dodged the Gestapo and delivered   at last   the major portion of Galeazzo Ciano s diaries to the Allies for publication, just as Edda had warned Hitler. Delivering justice On 27 May 1945, Allen Dulles held the papers in his hands; the papers that three women   Edda Ciano, Hilde Beetz and Frances de Chollet   had each risked their lives to preserve, and that bound them in a curious wartime friendship. Together, the papers were, in the words of the US government,  the most important single political document concerning recent Italian affairs in existence . In front of Dulles was Robert H Jackson, the US chief counsel and head prosecutor at the trials that would come to be known simply as Nuremberg, after their location. The charges were crimes against the peace, conspiracy, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The diaries of Galeazzo Ciano were among the most important pieces of evidence against members of Hitler s innermost circle. Whatever small measure of justice Nuremberg amounted to, set against the sweeping depravity of World War II, these women   in what must rank as one of the war s greatest rescue missions   helped to deliver one part of it to history. Dr Tilar J Mazzeo is a bestselling author and an associate professor at the Universit  de Montr al.

        "content": "When the air raid siren began to blare, everyone on the third floor ran for the basement   except for 19-year-old Vera Jahans, the naval switchboard operator, who was ordered to stay at her post. She was told to wear her tin hat, and,  if it got very noisy, to get under the board for a bit . After the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, switchboards like hers were in operation 24 hours a day, coordinating the movement of troops and supplies. Vera was just one of more than 75,000 women who served in the Women s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) during the Second World War, undertaking vital   and sometimes dangerous   work. Ad The WRNS had first been established in 1917 during the First World War, when around 6,000  Wrens  took on predominantly administrative and domestic jobs in the Royal Navy to release men for frontline duty. Disbanded in peacetime, it was reformed in April 1939, when war again became inevitable. Dame Vera Laughton Mathews, who had spent two years with the WRNS during the first war, was appointed as its new director. In the Second World War, the only way for women to undertake military duties was to join one of the three auxiliary services that provided supporting staff for the armed forces. Alongside the WRNS was the Army s Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS), and the Women s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). The WRNS quickly became the most popular. As the smallest of the women s services, entry into the WRNS was naturally more competitive. Read more | An army of women: adventures in the Auxiliary Territorial Service Like many women, 18-year-old Barbara Smoker was anxious about factory work  because I d feel I was making things that would kill people and wound people, and this seemed to me such an awful thing . She thought that in the services, she would be less directly involved in killing the enemy and so volunteered before she risked being called up for factory work. The WRNS also offered women more opportunities for skilled specialist work in addition to general domestic roles. What was WRNS training like? Newspaper adverts and recruitment posters depicted a smart woman in uniform calling for volunteers to  Join the Wrens   and Free a Man for the Fleet . Paulina Nichol, who served as a WRNS meteorologist, recalls wearing  a straight blue serge skirt, black stockings, dark blue bloomers (a fleecy material) and a jacket which... fitted pretty well if you were lucky.  And, unlike the women of the ATS, most Wrens were volunteers rather than conscripts. With thousands of applications every time new positions opened, the WRNS was seen as the most exclusive of the auxiliaries, and the recruiting officers were able to take their pick of the best candidates. But when women were called up, they were in for a shock. Each one had to earn her place   and her uniform. The women first reported as probationers to Mill Hill, London, for two weeks  basic training. Dressed in overalls, there was none of the promised glamour. According to 19-year-old Eileen Drury, the whole affair was  designed to put us off... it was perfectly dreadful, nearly killed us!  Lectured on naval traditions, the women were taught to drill, and any romantic notions of crewing sailboats were quickly dismissed. Josephine Pearce says,  I remember spending most of the fortnight scrubbing rough bare concrete floors... cleaning, cleaning, cleaning and more cleaning.

The recruiters were seeking resilient women who weren t afraid of hard work or being shouted at by their superiors. Instead of joining an exclusive club based on social class or wealth, Wrens were selected based on their skills and experience. The director, Vera Laughton Mathews, insisted that, apart from the initial appointments in 1939 when the WRNS was being established, all officers should be appointed from the ranks. After basic training, the women were interviewed. If they were accepted, they were given a chance to choose their role and finally receive their uniforms. Initially, the navy only wanted women for domestic and clerical duties, but even before the war began, they asked Wrens to take on coding and cypher work. To keep communications secret, a coder would encrypt messages to be sent between ships and bases by substituting the text with pre-agreed words and phrases. Read more | Female codebreakers: the women of Bletchley Park However, a Cypher Wren dealt with more confidential material, substituting each letter using a more complex system. Enid Bruce began working as a Wren coder in her home city of Newcastle at the end of 1939. Then, in May 1943, she became a cypher officer on board a troop ship. Wrens were not permitted to serve on large Royal Navy vessels. As well as maintaining its ban on women in combat positions, the navy argued that it must ensure propriety   there were no separate female quarters on board. Yet troop ships like Queen Elizabeth, which Enid worked on, had been converted from luxury liners, so accommodation was not an issue. In total, approximately 30 Wrens worked on troop ships and handled sensitive information, including messages bound for the Allied leaders  conferences in Quebec and Tehran. While the British worked hard to protect their own communications, they were simultaneously trying to break the enemy s codes. Eileen Drury was offered a role so secret that she wasn t allowed to tell anyone about it   not even her parents. If anyone asked, she was doing clerical work. Reporting to a top-secret building in Stanmore, London, Eileen joined a small group of Wrens in charge of Britain s first computers, a series of machines called Bombes. On the podcast | Kathy Kleiman reveals how six women helped create the world s first modern computer Built by the country s top codebreakers at Bletchley Park, the Bombes were set up by the Wrens according to precise instructions, and they waited for hours as they processed thousands of combinations, aiming to crack the German naval codes. Allied convoys transporting troops and valuable supplies were at the mercy of Germany s submarines, the U-boats. If Bletchley could break a code in time, the convoys could be warned in advance of the enemy s plans. When the Bombe suddenly stopped, the Wren noted the position of the dials, and the information was sent back to the team at Bletchley. Eileen says the Wrens were under  a lot of pressure to be quick and terribly accurate and not to make mistakes... we knew if we were quick and could get the message up quickly, we could save a lot of lives . Eileen later volunteered for service abroad, spending two years working for South East Asia Command in Colombo, Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka), dealing with Japanese codes. Wrens first went overseas in 1941, and by the end of the war they had served in Ceylon, Egypt, Kenya, Singapore, Iraq, South Africa, the United States and Northern Europe. They supported the Royal Navy across the globe. A Wren (member of the Women's Royal Naval Service) changes a tyre at the HMS Daedalus shore establishment in Hampshire, 1941 (Photo by Horace Abrahams/ Keystone Features/ Hulton Archive/ Getty Images) How did the WRNS change during the war? While the majority of women were still employed in domestic roles (such as cooking and cleaning) by 1941, the number of jobs available to women increased significantly. For instance, all naval despatch riders were Wrens, delivering messages by motorbike, and they also began crewing small craft within the navy s harbours. As meteorologists, their forecasts informed the navy and its air force, the Fleet Air Arm, ahead of manoeuvres. In the months leading up to D-Day, the Wrens helped build up knowledge of how weather systems behaved across the Channel and the impact these could have on the operation. From parachute packers to radar plotters, the list of jobs kept growing. New technologies such as radar required more people on the ground to install and maintain equipment, leading to a growth in mechanical roles. Female conscription was introduced in December 1941, and over the next year WRNS membership doubled from 10,653 to 22,898, peaking at 74,635 in 1944. Wrens put together the practice bombs for pilot training, which contained a bright orange dye to show whether or not they had hit their target. The dye stained the Wrens  hands, and their overalls were forever covered in oil from the guns In her admission interview, Louise Taylor requested to do  something out of doors . With a grasp of physics and  strong wrists , Louise undertook six months  training as an ordnance mechanic. She learnt to strip down different guns and name all the separate parts   one gun she worked with, she recalled, had over 365 parts   before putting them back together again. Once qualified, Louise was posted to Scotland with the Fleet Air Arm. Her job was to maintain and clean the guns (including those fitted in aircraft) and then test them to make sure that they were all in working order. Louise and the other Wrens also put together the practice bombs for pilot training, which contained a bright orange dye to show whether or not they had hit their target. The dye stained the Wrens  hands, and their overalls were forever covered in oil from the guns. Carrying around heavy wooden tool boxes was hard work. There were meant to be weight limits on what women could lift and carry, but nobody ever checked. In due course, Louise was placed in charge of the explosives compound, checking the inventory and safety of the site   a major responsibility. Read more | The women and children of munitions factories in WW1 Were the Wrens ever in combat roles? Women were still not permitted in combat roles, but sometimes the boundaries became unclear   particularly during Operation Outward. From 1942 until the Allies landed in Normandy, Wrens were employed in a secret scheme in the coastal town of Felixstowe, Suffolk. Inflating large balloons measuring about 8 feet in diameter, the Wrens then attached either a long trailing wire or an incendiary device to the end. When the wind blew in the right direction, these balloons drifted across the Channel to German-occupied Europe. The aim was to cause a major nuisance; for the wires to bring down telephone lines, and for the incendiaries to set fire to crops and buildings (one balloon even caused a blaze that destroyed a power station). Unusually, these Wrens were also trained to fire Lewis guns and rifles in case they came under attack. When the wind was blowing the wrong way, the Wrens spent their time making grommets: circles of interlaced wire that were hung across harbour entrances to prevent submarines entering. In total, Operation Outward employed seven Wren officers and 140 Wrens, and they successfully launched over 99,000 balloons. The Wrens also played a crucial part in implementing radar; a major innovation championed by the British armed forces during the war. Wren radio mechanics were trained to install radar units in aircraft and boats and to fix them quickly if anything went wrong. Radar used radio waves to ascertain the location of other vessels and aircraft. This information was then relayed to operation rooms, where Wrens received details of the locations and plotted them on a grid, providing commanding officers with a three-dimensional view of the situation. On the podcast | Tessa Dunlop explores the lives of the last surviving women who served in Britain s armed forces during WW2 Former Wrens recall looking at the grid on D-Day and trying to keep track of the hundreds of ships crossing the Channel. Thelma Stollar trained for nine months as a radio mechanic, and in March 1944 she reported to HMS Collingwood to help set up a radar training school. Their male commanding officer  was utterly appalled to see us and said that it was absolutely useless to have Wrens... he was furious.  He told the women they would have to run cables, fix generators and mix cement; not women s work. To which, Thelma said, the Wrens replied:  Oh, we can do that!  According to her, they always said,  we can do that . Over the course of the war, the women of the WRNS adapted to new roles, taking on more responsibilities and facing new challenges. Such was the vital contribution of the Wrens that in 1949 the service was made permanent, before eventually being integrated into the Royal Navy in 1993.

What language did they speak? How were slaves treated throughout the empire? And was gladiator fighting really as popular as modern movies and novels portray it to be? Read on for your guide to ancient Rome  Ad Q: Who founded ancient Rome? A: Like all ancient societies, the Romans possessed a heroic foundation story. What made the Romans different, however, is that they created two distinct creation myths for themselves. In the first it was claimed that they were descended from the royal Trojan refugee Aeneas (himself the son of the goddess Venus). In the second it was stated that the city of Rome was founded by, and ultimately named after, Romulus, son of a union between an earthly princess and the god Mars. Both myths helped establish the Romans as a divinely chosen people whose ancestry could be traced back to Troy and the Hellenistic world. Roman tradition had Romulus  foundling city established on the Palatine Hill in what became, for Rome,  Year One  (or 753 BC in the Christian calendar of the West). Archaeological excavation on the hill has found settlement here dating back to at least 1000 BC. A depiction of Romulus, the legendary founder and first king of Rome, c753 BC. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The Romulus and Remus story tells of two babies, royal twins ousted by their great-uncle, found and suckled by a wolf then brought up by an honest shepherd. As men, they returned to found the city of Rome   and then Romulus murdered his brother. How Romans saw this story tells us a great deal about the way they perceived themselves, says Mary Beard when talking about the Roman republic. Civil war and fratricide were embedded in their history; they were never going to escape civil war because right at the very beginning   the first moment in Roman history   a brother killed a brother.

A: Rome made much of the fact that it was a republic, ruled by the people and not by kings. Rome had overthrown its monarchy in 509 BC, and legislative power was thereafter vested in the people s assemblies: political power in the senate, and military power with two annually elected magistrates known as consuls. The acronym  SPQR , for Senatus Populusque Romanus ( the Senate and People of Rome ) was proudly emblazoned across inscriptions and military standards throughout the Mediterranean   a reminder that Rome s people (theoretically) had the last word. A depiction of the senate. (Image by Getty Images) By the late 1st century BC, the combination of power-hungry politicians and large overseas territories resulted in the breakdown of traditional systems of government. Even after the rise of the Roman emperors   kings in all but name, who  guided  the Roman political system in the 1st century AD    SPQR  continued to be used in order to sustain the fiction that Rome was a state governed by purely republican principles. Answered by Miles Russell Q: What was the senate in ancient Rome? A: Under the Roman republican constitution, the monarchy was abolished, but the king s former advisory council of elders survived in the form of the senate (senex being Latin for  old man ). Originally comprising the heads of each leading family in Rome, the senate became the key component in Roman politics, with responsibilities in finance and expenditure, foreign policy, the appointment of provincial governors, and military strategy, although legislative power was ultimately vested in the various people s assemblies. In order that decisive action could be taken in the field of domestic politics, the senate was guided by two annually elected consuls of equal authority, who, for the duration of their posts, possessed supreme power. Consuls needed to be in agreement if action could be taken, and each could veto the decisions of the other. In times of extreme emergency, a dictator (who  spoke  for the people), was appointed to deal with the crisis. Answered by Miles Russell Q: What was life like in ancient Rome? A: Most wealthy Romans were able to afford both a town house (domus) and an out of town rural retreat (villa). The best town houses possessed private spaces for family use, grouped around and facing an internal courtyard or garden. They also featured public rooms for the receiving of business visitors, clients and official guests. Read more | Did Romans really wear togas?

Slaves were usually accommodated within discrete areas of wealthy family homes. There were also insulae, the forerunner of modern apartment buildings. Each insula consisted of around half a dozen living spaces for Rome s middle class and poorer citizens, the plebs, as well as shops and businesses on the ground floor.

A: As for food in ancient Rome, the Romans ate pretty much everything they could lay their hands on. Meat, especially pork and fish, however, were expensive commodities, and so the bulk of the population survived on cereals (wheat, emmer and barley) mixed with chickpeas, lentils, turnips, lettuce, leek, cabbage and fenugreek.

A: Gladiatorial games were organised by the elite throughout the Roman empire in order to distract the population from the reality of daily life. Most gladiators were purchased from slave markets, being chosen for their strength, stamina and good looks. Although taken from the lowest elements of society, the gladiator was a breed apart from the  normal  slave or prisoner of war, being well-trained combatants whose one role in life was to fight and occasionally to kill for the amusement of the Roman mob.

DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini/Getty Images) Whatever their reasons for ending up in the arena, gladiators were adored by the Roman public for their bravery and spirit. Their images appeared frequently in mosaics, wall paintings and on glassware and pottery. Answered by Miles Russell Q: Why did the Romans build straight roads? A: While some Roman roads might have bends or corners, the vast majority are distinctively straight as they march for mile after mile across Britain and Europe. Unlike modern roads, the via munita were not intended for the use of ordinary people. Only army units, government officials and those with a special pass were allowed to use them. When moving armies, or officials to deal with emergencies, speed was paramount. Everyone else had to make do with using local dirt tracks. An old Roman road in Sardinia, Italy. (Photo by Getty Images) Of course, you would think certain natural features   steep hills and valleys   of the landscape could affect the straightness of the via munita. Not so, Roman roads went straight up the most precipitous of slopes without winding back and forth in hairpin bends like modern roads. This is because a marching man on foot can go straight up a steep hill and then rest to recover before moving on much quicker than if he wound around a gently rising slope. Army supplies were carried on mules who could likewise go up a steep slope without much trouble. Draught animals pulling wagons needed the gentler slope, but the via munita were not built for merchants who used wagons. Answered by Rupert Matthews The Romans get the credit for a lot of inventions, but things are more complicated than that. Historian Jem Duducu investigates what the Romans really did for us  Q: Why did ancient Rome fall? A: A whole variety of reasons can be suggested to explain the fall of the Roman empire in the west: disease, invasion, civil war, social unrest, inflation, economic collapse. In fact all were contributory factors, although key to the collapse of Roman authority was the prolonged period of imperial in-fighting during the 3rd and 4th century. Read more about the fall of Rome Conflict between multiple emperors severely weakened the military, eroded the economy and put a huge strain upon local populations. When Germanic migrants arrived, many western landowners threw their support behind the new  barbarian  elite rather than continuing to back the emperor. Reduced income from the provinces meant that Rome could no longer pay or feed its military and civil administration, making the imperial system of government redundant.

Read on for your guide to ancient Rome  Ad Q: Who founded ancient Rome? A: Like all ancient societies, the Romans possessed a heroic foundation story. What made the Romans different, however, is that they created two distinct creation myths for themselves. In the first it was claimed that they were descended from the royal Trojan refugee Aeneas (himself the son of the goddess Venus). In the second it was stated that the city of Rome was founded by, and ultimately named after, Romulus, son of a union between an earthly princess and the god Mars. Both myths helped establish the Romans as a divinely chosen people whose ancestry could be traced back to Troy and the Hellenistic world. Roman tradition had Romulus  foundling city established on the Palatine Hill in what became, for Rome,  Year One  (or 753 BC in the Christian calendar of the West). Archaeological excavation on the hill has found settlement here dating back to at least 1000 BC. A depiction of Romulus, the legendary founder and first king of Rome, c753 BC. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The Romulus and Remus story tells of two babies, royal twins ousted by their great-uncle, found and suckled by a wolf then brought up by an honest shepherd. As men, they returned to found the city of Rome   and then Romulus murdered his brother. How Romans saw this story tells us a great deal about the way they perceived themselves, says Mary Beard when talking about the Roman republic. Civil war and fratricide were embedded in their history; they were never going to escape civil war because right at the very beginning   the first moment in Roman history   a brother killed a brother.

A: Rome made much of the fact that it was a republic, ruled by the people and not by kings. Rome had overthrown its monarchy in 509 BC, and legislative power was thereafter vested in the people s assemblies: political power in the senate, and military power with two annually elected magistrates known as consuls. The acronym  SPQR , for Senatus Populusque Romanus ( the Senate and People of Rome ) was proudly emblazoned across inscriptions and military standards throughout the Mediterranean   a reminder that Rome s people (theoretically) had the last word. A depiction of the senate. (Image by Getty Images) By the late 1st century BC, the combination of power-hungry politicians and large overseas territories resulted in the breakdown of traditional systems of government. Even after the rise of the Roman emperors   kings in all but name, who  guided  the Roman political system in the 1st century AD    SPQR  continued to be used in order to sustain the fiction that Rome was a state governed by purely republican principles. Answered by Miles Russell Q: What was the senate in ancient Rome? A: Under the Roman republican constitution, the monarchy was abolished, but the king s former advisory council of elders survived in the form of the senate (senex being Latin for  old man ). Originally comprising the heads of each leading family in Rome, the senate became the key component in Roman politics, with responsibilities in finance and expenditure, foreign policy, the appointment of provincial governors, and military strategy, although legislative power was ultimately vested in the various people s assemblies. In order that decisive action could be taken in the field of domestic politics, the senate was guided by two annually elected consuls of equal authority, who, for the duration of their posts, possessed supreme power. Consuls needed to be in agreement if action could be taken, and each could veto the decisions of the other. In times of extreme emergency, a dictator (who  spoke  for the people), was appointed to deal with the crisis. Answered by Miles Russell Q: What was life like in ancient Rome? A: Most wealthy Romans were able to afford both a town house (domus) and an out of town rural retreat (villa). The best town houses possessed private spaces for family use, grouped around and facing an internal courtyard or garden. They also featured public rooms for the receiving of business visitors, clients and official guests. Read more | Did Romans really wear togas?

Rome s underfloor miracle At its simplest, a hypocaust worked by circulating hot air through a hollow space beneath the floor.

But it wasn t just about heating the floor. Read more | How and why did the Roman empire fall?  The hypocaust was used to heat houses via underfloor heating, but actually we ve got a number of houses where we ve got evidence of box flue tiles in the walls,  says Platts.  So we know that hypocausts could heat the walls of the rooms as well.  In the context of ancient Rome this was engineering of incredible sophistication. Archaeological remains from sites such as Pompeii and Ostia, and across Roman Britain, show entire suites of rooms heated by the system. Stepping barefoot on a mosaic floor, warmed from underneath, was quite literally to step upon Roman ingenuity.

(Photo by Getty Images) From the baths to the villa The hypocaust began as a public luxury, eventually exported to private homes. The earliest examples appeared in the great bath complexes (thermae) of the late republic and early empire. Roman baths were vast public leisure centres and required consistent, large-scale heating. The first recorded Roman hypocausts date to the first century BC, developed under architects and engineers serving figures such as Marcus Agrippa, the ally and later son-in-law of the Roman emperor Augustus. Under Augustus himself, public bathhouses multiplied across Rome and its provinces. The technique soon spread to private villas, where the wealthy adapted public comfort for domestic display. By the second century AD, during the reigns of emperors such as Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, the hypocaust had become a standard feature of elite architecture across the empire   from the Mediterranean heartlands to the frontier forts of Britain. The price of luxury But this warmth came at a cost.  We know that the idea of heating your house was really important, but it wasn t for everyone,  says Platts.  To have a hypocaust system in one s house was a big sign of wealth. It would generally only have been present in examples of really opulent and wealthy dwellings: dwellings that, for example, might have their own private bathhouses.  They didn t even need to go to the general baths. They could just have fun in their own spaces.  And, Platts says, what often goes forgotten is that maintaining heat from a hypocaust was hard.

What also would be luxuries could be the way in which people spent their fortunes in other ways,  Platts says.  I m thinking about fashionable clothing, or elaborate jewellery or gemstones. Romans loved amber. They loved pearls. They had quite a thing for uncut diamonds   as we all might   and things that were imported: ivory imported from Africa, silks imported from towards China.  The global reach of the Roman empire fed its appetite for exotic goods. To own these luxuries, to eat peppered dishes and dress in silk, was to embody the luxuries of empire.  Anything like fine wines, exotic spices, was a really good way of showing your status,  Platts notes. In this way, food became another way to demonstrate power.

        "content": "When we think of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Great Pyramid of Giza or the Hanging Gardens of Babylon may be the first examples that come to mind. However, the oldest-known versions of the list start with a landmark that is often forgotten: the Temple of Artemis. Ad Located in the ancient city of Ephesus (near modern-day Sel uk, Turkey), this remarkable place of worship was renowned for its size and scale, standing at least 20 metres tall and boasting an enormous tile-covered roof supported by 127 marble columns. With a floor plan of some 6,000 square metres, the temple was also nearly three times as large as the famous Parthenon in Athens. But some of the most startling archaeological evidence from Ephesus isn t concerned with the dimensions of the temple, nor its complicated history of destruction and rebuilding. Instead, much attention has been directed towards a collection of statues depicting the temple s patron deity, Artemis. A 20th-century depiction of the Temple of Artemis, dedicated to the goddess Artemis (Image by Bridgeman Images) Rather than portraying the goddess as a conventional Greek beauty, the sculptures display Artemis in an altogether different guise. And, according to classicist and broadcaster Bettany Hughes, these statues bear a particularly striking physical characteristic.  [This] is not the Artemis that you probably have in your heads  this image of a beautiful young woman in a tiny Greek chiton, artfully pulling a bow and arrow,  reveals Hughes on an episode of the HistoryExtra podcast.  She is a huge, towering figure, covered in birds and bees, goats and curious figures. But what none of you will miss  is that she looks as though she has 30 or so breasts.  Thirty breasts  or testicles? What need did Artemis have for 30 breasts? As well as being the goddess of hunting and the moon, Artemis was also revered as a deity of fertility and childbirth. Having a multitude of breasts would therefore be a fitting attribute for a goddess so intrinsically connected with fecundity and womanhood. In fact, even alternative theories   which suggest that the  breasts  are actually bulls  testicles or sacks of honey   bolster Artemis s association with abundance. Both motifs have also been used as symbols of procreation in Greek art, so the ambiguity was likely deliberate.  These ancient craftsmen are likely playing a game with us,  says Hughes. Ultimately, the ancient Greeks believed that Artemis was so potent in her fertility that  she didn t need anything as mundane as sex to procreate .

Artemis is an enduring symbol of fertility (Image by Alamy) A goddess of power and procreation It s not just the features on the statue[s] itself that suggest Artemis s importance   the location where they were discovered is notable too. Ephesus was situated on the eastern edge of the ancient Greek world, where Artemis s association with fertility and childbirth was perhaps stronger than elsewhere. Read more | Wanderlust: Bettany Hughes on the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World  The Artemis who was worshipped in Ephesus was an  eastern Artemis    a direct descendant of the great nature goddesses of the eastern world,  says Hughes.  Any ancient traveller who went to visit the temple would have been left in no doubts of how extremely strong and potent she was.  While Artemis was regarded as a powerful goddess for all, she was particularly important to women. Care of the temple was entrusted to high priestesses, a system that Hughes likens to a  hive buzzing around, serving the queen bee . Overall, maleness was not well tolerated at the site; it was intended to be devoted to female presence and power. An offer of sanctuary But it wasn t just the high priestesses who devoted themselves to Artemis. Countless ordinary women also dedicated themselves to this bastion of fertility, travelling from far and wide to give offerings.  Poor female pilgrims would beat a path to Artemis s door, and some of them would leave extraordinary gifts [and] beautiful gold offerings,  says Hughes.  They were left as temple dedications and then buried as hoards.  In some cases, the poorest pilgrims would simply leave a seashell for Artemis instead. They merely offered whatever they could, in the hope that the goddess would provide protection and preparation for marriage and childbirth. Crucially, the Temple of Artemis wasn t solely a place for worship   it also functioned as a place of refuge for the oppressed. Hughes adds,  If you were being persecuted politically, and even if you were a woman escaping domestic abuse, you could go to sanctuary at the temple.

Its sheer scale and beauty were matched only by the power of the goddess it honoured. To the modern eye, her many breasts might seem slightly mystifying. But   whether seen as symbols of fertility, abundance or simply a playful riddle set by ancient craftsmen   they remind us of the complexity and depth of her worship.

        "title": "Ancient Roman theatre was a powerful weapon of empire, so why were actors' lives so tragic?",
        "content": "Roman society was acutely hierarchical. Every occupation carried a moral weight, and the line between dignity and dishonour was a stark one. A senator who spoke in the law courts could win eternal repute, but a gladiator who risked his life to entertain the masses was branded socially devalued, and the same was true of actors. Ad No matter how dazzling their performances in front of a packed theatre might be, their profession consigned them to the lowest rungs of society. By law they were infamis; people of ill repute, stripped of civic rights and grouped alongside the enslaved. But what was this paradoxical life of stardom and shame really like for the actors of the Roman empire? Roman theatre s golden age under Augustus  When we talk about a golden age of Roman theatre, we tend to be talking about Emperor Augustus s reign and the beginning of the Roman empire,  says Jessica Clarke, author of A New History of Ancient Roman Theatre, speaking on the HistoryExtra podcast.  This was a period with new cultural, religious and political structures being implemented.  Augustus was the first emperor of Rome, ruling from 27 BC until AD 14. And he grasped how useful theatre could be as a political tool. Read more | The worst Roman emperors Spectacle was part of a strategy that Romans would come to call panem et circenses, or bread and circuses: free food and entertainment offered to the populace in return for loyalty and social cohesion. Drama and performance helped bind audiences into a shared Roman identity and provided a stage (quite literally) for imperial ideology. This 1st-century AD mosaic from the House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii depicts the staging of a theatrical performance. Such scenes highlight the importance of theatre in Roman cultural life, blending entertainment with expressions of myth, satire, and social commentary. (Photo by Getty Images) A web of theatres across the Roman empire  Augustus built hundreds of theatres across the Roman empire, all following the design of the theatre that he also built for himself in Rome,  Clarke explains.  These theatres are enormous, they re spread across all of the provinces. Essentially, what he built was a web of entertainment venues that Rome was in charge of.  These theatres were architectural marvels in themselves. The Theatre of Marcellus in Rome, inaugurated by Augustus in 13 BC and named after his nephew, could seat more than 10,000 people. Its semicircular rows of stone seating rose above a wide orchestra space and a stage backed by the towering scaenae frons; a richly decorated permanent backdrop of columns, niches and statues. Men and women alike could attend the performances at this new wave of theatres, (unlike in Greece, where women were mostly banned from attending) and seating was arranged by social rank, with senators and equestrians   members of the second-highest social class   in prime positions, and the poor higher up. Performances ranged from solemn tragedies to ribald comedies, farcical mimes and elaborate pantomimes accompanied by music and dance. Admission was usually free, funded by magistrates or emperors seeking popularity. Who performed and who was excluded The Roman stage, however, was overwhelmingly male. As in Greece, women were largely banned from treading the boards. Clarke points to the existence of scant evidence of female performers in mime and pantomime   forms considered lower status and more risqu    but official theatre roles were reserved for men.  It s quite similar to Shakespearean rules around who is allowed to step onto a stage,  says Clarke.  Though it would have been slightly easier for men to play the female roles because they had masks on.  Masks, made of linen and plaster or occasionally wood, were central to performance, and not just because they made it easier for men to portray women; they exaggerated expressions and amplified voices too.

Listen to all episodes now On the Ides of March 44 BC, the most famous Roman in history was murdered. Julius Caesar's assassination transformed Rome forever, and the image of his bloody toga has haunted monarchs and tyrants ever since. Actors as infamis No amount of training or talent could lift an actor out of the social stigma that came with the role.  In ancient Rome, acting was an incredibly lowly profession,  says Clarke.  It wasn t something that was seen as an acceptable job for a Roman citizen to undertake. An actor was in the class known as infamis.  This was the same class as a slave; the same class as a prostitute. You would have no voting rights, and you also don t have bodily autonomy, so you don t have legal rights over your body,  Clarke explains. Why this disdain? Roman moralists believed that a respectable citizen should preserve dignitas (dignity) and gravitas (seriousness). To display one s body on stage, to impersonate others, or to provoke laughter was considered undignified. The actor sold their body and voice for public pleasure, which made the profession inherently shameful. This attitude was consistent with how Roman society viewed other entertainers. Gladiators might achieve celebrity in the arena, and charioteers could command passionate fan followings, but both were technically degraded in status. Performers were celebrated in spectacle but lacked any standing in civic life. The life of a Roman actor Evidence from inscriptions, satirical writings and contracts paints a picture of precariousness. Troupes travelled from town to town, dependent on festivals and civic sponsorship for work, while pay was unreliable; some actors received generous gifts, others little more than food and board. The constant would have been the rehearsals. Actors trained their voices to carry across open-air theatres, practised precise gestures codified to signal emotions and maintained the masks, costumes and props essential for performance. Injuries would have been common, especially in physical pantomimes involving acrobatics. Read more | The overshadowed ancient empire that rivalled Rome with maritime might and an iron fist  But that doesn t mean that we don t know about some very famous actors,  says Clarke.  One we know of is called Clodius Aesopus. He was the most famous tragic actor in the late Republic. Cicero was friends with him.  Aesopus, active in the first century BC, was celebrated for bringing Greek classics to Roman audiences. As Clarke notes, he became a personal acquaintance of Marcus Tullius Cicero, one of Rome s greatest statesmen, orators and philosophers, whose speeches still survive as masterpieces of Latin prose. That such a figure could publicly befriend an actor underscores the inherent paradox: Aesopus was admired, wealthy and socially connected, yet in law he remained infamis. Life as a Roman actor was full of strange contradictions. The art form of theatre was a powerful political tool, theatres themselves were magnificent constructions, audiences were vast and enthusiastic, and some performers became famous enough to mingle with Rome s elite. Yet the profession itself stripped actors of rights and respect. It was a life lived in the spotlight, but without dignity.

        "title": "Living with the dead? You need to know these 7 gruesome facts about the history of human burial",
        "content": "From the depths of prehistory, human societies have grappled with the same question: how do we treat the dead? Those many varying answers offer a valuable insight into how people across history have understood life, faith and human relationships. Ad From Tutankhamun s tomb to the mysterious Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo, many of the most famous   and culturally significant   historical and archaeological discoveries have centred around the notion of burial. It s for that reason that historian Roger Luckhurst, author of Graveyards: A History of Living with the Dead, thinks that burial practices say as much about the living and their societies, as they do about the dead. In a conversation on the HistoryExtra podcast, Luckhurst shared seven important (and unsettling) facts that trace how our relationship with death has evolved across history. 1. Homo sapiens weren t the first to bury our dead For centuries, archaeologists thought deliberate burial marked the beginning of humanity. Care for the dead, they argued, was the dividing line between Homo sapiens other human species, like Homo heidelbergensis or the Denisovans.  It used to be the case that archaeologists thought that they could identify Homo sapiens by how they cared for their dead,  Luckhurst says.  Actually, there are other versions of [archaic humans] who were burying their dead probably intentionally.  But recent discoveries have challenged that assumption. Read more | When and why did Neanderthals go extinct? Now, archaeological evidence seems to suggest that other human species, including Neanderthals, carefully laid their dead in shallow graves, possibly alongside flowers. One of the most famous examples is in Spain s Sima de las Palomas archaeological site, where a Neanderthal woman and her child seem to have been buried together, with their bodies positioned in a specific way. Far from the brutish caricature of early humans, Neanderthals may have shared our impulse to mark death as a meaningful part of life. 2. Nations recruit their dead to tell stories about themselves From ancient empires to modern democracies, death has always served politics in the form of monuments and memorials.  If you think about most national narratives, it's nearly always about the sacrifice of the people who founded the modern nation,  says Luckhurst.  In England we have this celebration of Memorial Day in November to mark the Armistice [at the end of the First World War]. And there are monuments in every village and every church for those who died in the two world wars.  Across Europe, the aftermath of the world wars turned graveyards into civic altars. Cenotaphs, war cemeteries and endless rows of white crosses framed sacrifice as the foundation of unity and national image. But the phenomenon of using the dead to tell a broader story extends beyond the West.  In Africa, one of my favourite graveyards is in Zimbabwe,  says Luckhurst,  where the cemetery is shaped like an AK-47 rifle because that's the rifle that the people buried there used as independence fighters   the graves are [shaped like] bullets in the magazine.  3. Lenin s corpse sparked a modern cult of preservation When Vladimir Lenin died in 1924, the newly formed Soviet Union faced a problem: how should its revolutionary hero be memorialised?  He died after the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun,  says Luckhurst,  and the Soviets thought,  There's a preserved body that s laid for thousands of years, why don't we do this with Lenin?  The embalmed body of Vladimir Lenin lies in state, preserved for public viewing after his death in 1924. Displayed in Moscow s Red Square, the Soviet leader s mausoleum became both a shrine to the revolution and a symbol of enduring political power. (Photo by Getty Images) A special laboratory was built beneath Lenin s mausoleum on Red Square, where scientists experimented with chemicals to halt decay. The result was a body that has been preserved for nearly a century, tended to by teams of embalmers who still adjust his features under carefully controlled conditions.  [The Russians] even did this with Ho Chi Minh,  Luckhurst adds,  and kept it hidden for about six years until the Vietnam war was over.  What began as a self-contained Soviet experiment became a Cold War phenomenon, as other communist states adopted the same secular sainthood, embalming leaders from China s Mao Zedong to North Korea s Kim Il-sung. 4. Mummification began long before ancient Egypt The Egyptians made mummification famous, but they weren t the first to use it as a means of caring for their dead.  Mummification is a way of preserving a body by drying it out,  says Luckhurst,  but 2000 years before [ancient Egypt], in Chile there was a culture that was preserving bodies in a different kind of way.  Luckhurst was referring to the Chinchorro culture of coastal Chile and Peru, who as early as 5000 BC carefully prepared their dead with clay masks and natural salts. The region s arid air and saline soil acted as natural preservatives, inspiring deliberate human techniques. Read more | The pharaohs and dynasties that ruled ancient Egypt Egyptians would later transform that process into a religious art, codified under the Old Kingdom (around 2600 BC) into a 70-day ritual involving resins, oils and linen wrappings. 5. The Catholic world turned bone piles into works of art In medieval and early modern Europe, churchyards filled up quickly. The dead were buried close to sanctified ground, and when space ran out, bones were exhumed to make room for others   leading to the establishment of the ossuary, a monument built to be filled with the bones of the dead. Perhaps the best-known example of an ossuary can be found in the French capital.  Underneath the streets of Paris are hundreds of thousands of skulls,  says Luckhurst.  It's a very Catholic practice and it's designed to help you contemplate death.  In the Catacombs of Paris, six million skeletons were arranged into geometric walls of skulls and femurs. In the Sedlec Ossuary of the Czech Republic, monks turned human bones into chandeliers and coats of arms. Meanwhile, the Capuchin Crypt in Rome displays skeletons posed in niches. These were all intended to show that death was part of salvation s cycle. In the Catacombs of Paris, a man studies a skull by torchlight amid towering stacks of bones. Once part of the city s vast network of quarries, the ossuary now holds the remains of millions of Parisians. (Photo by Getty Images) 6. The Romans built cities of the dead outside their cities of the living Ancient Rome regulated death with remarkable precision. By law, burials were forbidden within city limits, a rule designed to protect both hygiene and sanctity.  They built laws quite quickly that set out that you must bury the dead outside the city limits. And that's where the word  necropolis  comes from,  Luckhurst explains. Along the Via Appia, tombs of senators and freedmen lined the roadside. These necropoleis (literally  cities of the dead ) were public spaces that served as memorials and monuments. Visitors passing through could read inscriptions, admire the sculpture and reflect on the continuity between life and death. 7. Europe s graveyards became dangerously overcrowded By the late Middle Ages, after the disaster of the Black Death, death once again loomed over Europe   and as the population grew, so did the problem.  From the medieval period onwards, some societies decided that they were going to live with the dead, crammed around Christian churches in classic churchyards, but also in the walls or in the crypts of these churches as well. So they started to become part of the architecture in a fundamental way,  says Luckhurst.  But by the 18th century, you start getting a real crisis with people thinking,  What on earth are we going to do with all of these dead?  As cities expanded, burial grounds grew packed. Corpses were layered in shared plots, and decomposing bodies seeped into wells and cellars. In London, decay became a very real public health hazard. It was a crisis that led to reform, and a massive social change. From the early 19th century, the garden cemetery movement transformed burial into something akin to landscape design. New cemeteries such as P re Lachaise in Paris (1804) and Kensal Green in London (1832) created tree-lined avenues and manicured plots that restored order to how the dead were buried. It was a distinct shift. Now, people weren t surrounded by the dead in the cities; the dead were no longer ever-present. Instead, they were separated from the living   out of sight, and, eventually, out of mind. Ad Roger Luckhurst was speaking to Ellie Cawthorne on the HistoryExtra podcast.

Podcasts invite listeners into the past through conversation and narrative   and when done right, this can bring history to life in a way that few other forms can match. But history podcasting has also become a crowded field, overflowing with choice and variety. With so many voices vying for attention, choosing where to spend your listening hours can feel like its own historical expedition. So, whether you re after scholarly debate, sweeping historical epics, or hidden corners of the past, this list highlights the very best history podcasts, perfect for learning something new along the way while being transported through time. Betwixt the Sheets Drag performer Willi Smith prepares backstage at a fundraising event for the Alley Theater Guild in Houston, Texas. (Photo by Getty Images) Hosted by historian Dr Kate Lister, Betwixt the Sheets: The History of Sex, Scandal and Society explores the intimate   and often overlooked   aspects of the human past. Lister, best known for her research on sexuality, brings academic expertise and irreverence, making the podcast distinctive in both its tone and content. The scope ranges from medieval sex manuals and contraception to the history of drag and the sexual politics of the Cold War. It highlights voices often absent from mainstream history, including stories of sex workers, queer communities and women navigating restrictive systems, while also revealing how sexuality indelibly intersects with politics, economics and religion. Dan Carlin s Hardcore History Dan Carlin s Hardcore History reshaped how history is told in audio form. Launched in 2006, it showed that audiences would happily devote hours (even half a day) to listen to a podcast episode about the past. Dan Carlin, a former journalist and broadcaster rather than a professional historian, delivers with a distinctive style; he immerses listeners in the period he s reflecting on, urging them to imagine what it was like to live in the past   from the Mongol conquests to the trenches of Verdun. Series such as Blueprint for Armageddon (on the First World War, running nearly 24 hours) or The Wrath of the Khans (on the Mongol empire) have become legendary. Episodes are released irregularly but each feels like a mammoth event: truly immersive and unforgettable. Empire Winston Churchill, Franklin D Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin sit together at the Yalta conference, alongside their senior military and diplomatic advisers, including Anthony Eden, Vyacheslav Molotov, and top Allied commanders. (Photo by Getty Images) Hosted by historian William Dalrymple and journalist Anita Anand, Empire tackles the history and legacy of global empires (albeit with a broad definition of the word). Dalrymple s expertise on India and the East India Company is complemented by Anand s journalistic questioning, producing a compelling mix of analysis and storytelling. The series on the Yalta Conference of 1945, as Hitler s defeat became increasingly imminent, is a particular highlight. It explores the unique roles of Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin in determining the future of postwar Europe, and how they interacted at this moment of seismic significance. Fall of Civilizations Fall of Civilizations is an exploration of history s great societies and how they collapsed, from the Maya and Khmer Empire to the Norse of Greenland and the Roman west. Episodes are long (often exceeding two hours) but host Paul Cooper s reflective narration, careful research and immersive sound design all combine to make for an engaging listen. He blends archaeology, primary sources and cultural history to ask not just why civilisations fell in the first place, but what lessons their decline can offer. Gone Medieval These illuminated pages from The Hours of Jeanne d Evreux depict the Entombment of Christ and the Flight into Egypt. Created in the early 14th century for the French queen Jeanne d Evreux, the manuscript is a masterpiece of Gothic illumination, blending devotional intimacy with exquisite detail. (Photo by Getty Images) Gone Medieval explores the millennium following the fall of the Western Roman empire   a period that shaped European history and beyond. Part of the History Hit network and hosted by Matt Lewis and Dr Cat Jarman, episodes cover subjects from Viking voyages and the Black Death to illuminated manuscripts and medieval queenship. Lewis often focuses on politics and warfare while Jarman, a bioarchaeologist, offers scientific insights into the period. By showcasing the vibrancy and diversity of the Middle Ages, the podcast manages to go well beyond the familiar clich s of knights and castles.

Episodes veer from one-off explorations of figures such as Lope de Aguirre or John Dee to multi-part series on topics ranging from the fall of Anglo-Saxon England to the Watergate scandal (and everything between). But perhaps the real appeal lies in the hosts  chemistry. The pair have known each other for decades, and the strength of their relationship creates a space to navigate challenging subjects with their wit and intellectual curiosity.

Portraying Kennedy as youthful, optimistic and effective, it contrasts sharply with today s political gerontocracy. While acknowledging the mythologised image shaped by his assassination, White shows JFK s short presidency was marked by real achievements, both domestic and foreign. His cool and pragmatic handling of crises, especially over Berlin and Cuba, demonstrated strategic acumen, while his late but firm commitment to civil rights gave his leadership moral weight. White doesn t ignore Kennedy s reckless private life, but argues it didn t impair his public role, suggesting his behaviour stemmed from lifelong health issues and a sense of mortality. Boldly stepping into historical  what-ifs , White persuasively contends JFK would have avoided the Vietnam War and pursued moderate reform at home. This tightly argued, post-revisionist account stands out as the finest single-volume analysis of Kennedy s presidency   an enlightening and engaging read.

With her signature flair for untangling forgotten corners of royal history, Rappaport uncovers the harrowing journey of a teenage girl thrust into the icy rituals of tsarist Russia and the violent hands of a disturbed husband, Grand Duke Konstantin. Julie s refusal to accept her fate   fleeing not once, but twice   marks her as a quietly radical figure amid Europe s rigid dynastic chessboard. Her life, largely self-erased from history out of fear and isolation, is here reclaimed with empathy, vivid detail and sharp insight. Rappaport also explores how Julie s ambitious yet relatively obscure noble family, led by the formidable matriarch Augusta, reshaped post-Napoleonic Europe through marriage. Rebel Romanov is both a deeply personal biography and a searing critique of aristocratic power, finally giving Julie the voice history denied her.

Best known for their fairy tales, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were also pioneering figures in philology, mythology and folklore, shaping these disciplines profoundly. Schmiesing offers a highly readable and comprehensive account of their intellectual legacy, placing it firmly within the historical and political context of 19th-century Germany. She captures their close personal bond and family dynamics, as well as their involvement in events like the Napoleonic Wars and the G ttingen Seven protest. Importantly, she doesn t shy away from addressing the problematic aspects of their work, including instances of antisemitism, offering a nuanced view of German Romanticism s legacy. This is an essential read not only for folklorists and fairy-tale scholars but for anyone interested in the wider cultural and intellectual currents of the period. Reviewer: Paul Cowdell, honorary senior research associate at the University of Bristol Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The Scapegoat: The Brilliant Brief Life of the Duke of Buckingham Lucy Hughes-Hallett Lucy Hughes-Hallett s Scapegoat delivers a rich, expansive portrait of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham   the dazzling court favourite of both James VI & I and Charles I. In over 600 pages, the author moves beyond the myth of  the handsomest-bodied man in all of England  to reveal a complex, flawed, and contradictory figure. Buckingham s meteoric rise was matched by scandal, corruption, and ultimately, a brutal fall. His relationships with both kings form a compelling, often fraught triangle of power, love, and loyalty. Hughes-Hallett s thematic approach makes this more than biography   it's a vivid, fast-paced journey through the intrigue of early Stuart court life, enriched by scandal, politics, and personal drama. Her prose is sharp, her detail meticulous, and her portrait of Buckingham both absorbing and humane. Scapegoat is not only an engaging study of one man s rise and ruin, but a strikingly colourful account of a pivotal era in British and European history.

Paula Akpan brings these rulers   like the cunning Queen Njinga of Ndongo and Matamba, the fiercely independent Ranavalona of Madagascar and the revolutionary Yaa Asantewaa of Ghana   vividly to life, balancing their triumphs with their complexities. Rather than flattening these figures into symbols of resistance or virtue, Akpan delves into the messy, powerful and sometimes violent realities of their rule. This is not a dry history lesson; it s a vibrant conversation between past and present, informed by community voices, a diverse array of perspectives and a sharp critique of colonial archives. Akpan challenges dominant narratives with clarity and passion, asking not just who ruled, but how and why their legacies endure or have been obscured. When We Ruled is essential reading for anyone interested in African history, women, power and memory.

She amplifies voices often unheard in ancient records: women, children and the enslaved, while interrogating the role of scholars in shaping historical understanding. Al-Rashid s highly personal style reveals history not as a neutral chronicle but as an evolving construct shaped by belief, cosmology and political power. While the book sidesteps certain philosophical questions such as conceptions of time or the effects of writing on oral tradition, it remains a revelatory study of  the history of history . Reviewer: Gojko Barjamovic is a senior lecturer in near eastern languages and civilisations and senior research scholar at Yale University Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Inventing the Renaissance: Myths of a Golden Age Ada Palmer Ada Palmer s Inventing the Renaissance offers a lively, accessible exploration of Renaissance political thought, centring on Machiavelli and the humanist tradition. While it touches on the Borgias and Medici for context, the real focus is Machiavelli s radical ideas, particularly his prioritisation of consequences over morals or rules, positioning him as a forerunner of utilitarianism. Palmer excels at explaining humanism s evolving definitions and Machiavelli s ambiguous place within it. The book combines scholarly insight with an idiosyncratic, blog-like style: humorous asides, comic dialogues and quirky chapter titles abound. Some readers may find the tone uneven, with jokes occasionally misfiring, but the philosophical content is strong and clearly explained. Though sprawling and at times tangential, it s an engaging guide to how Renaissance history has been shaped and reshaped by historiography. For those curious about Machiavelli s shock factor and humanism s core, this is an excellent starting point, even if more traditional art coverage lies elsewhere.

Her latest book is The Roads to Rome: A History Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Holy Places: How Pilgrimage Changed the World Kathryn Hurlock Kathryn Hurlock s Holy Places explores why pilgrimage is booming despite the decline of organised religion in the West. She examines 19 global sites, from Lourdes in France to Karbala in Iraq and Tai Shan in China, offering concise historical accounts that highlight their rituals and significance. While some pilgrims may begin these journeys for leisure, Hurlock suggests that walking in ancient footsteps often sparks unexpected introspection. She challenges the idea that modern pilgrimage is merely tourism, noting its long-standing commercial aspects. However, her academic approach   rich in notes and context but lacking personal experience or on-the-ground reportage   may leave some readers wanting more emotional depth. The book s strength lies in its clarity and breadth, but its cool, rational tone feels slightly detached from the passion and yearning that often define pilgrimage. For those seeking a thoughtful, scholarly introduction to sacred travel, Holy Places will appeal. For others, it may feel too dispassionate for its deeply human subject. Reviewer: Peter Stanford is a writer, broadcaster and author of Pilgrimage: Journeys of Meaning Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Summer of Fire and Blood: The German Peasants  War Lyndal Roper Lyndal Roper vividly recounts the brutal 1524 25 uprisings across the German lands, where thousands of peasants, motivated by communal grievances, attacked monasteries and castles with unprecedented fury. While largely non-violent, notable atrocities   such as the Weinsberg killings   prompted brutal noble retaliation. The rebels, despite their numbers and support from Florian Geyer s cavalry, were no match for the nobles  mercenaries. The resulting bloodshed was immense, with around 100,000 peasants killed in what contemporaries termed the Aufruhr ( turbulence ). Roper narrates these events with clarity and flair, offering a compelling reinterpretation of the revolt s causes. Rather than focusing solely on socio-economic factors, she foregrounds the religious motivations of the rebels, linking their actions to the spiritual upheaval sparked by Martin Luther. Her argument   that this was a revolutionary religious movement   is both persuasive and powerful. This is an essential read for anyone interested in early modern popular protest. Reviewer: Mark Stoyle is the author of A Murderous Midsummer: The Western Rising of 1549 Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The Monastic World: A 1,200-Year History Andrew Jotischky Andrew Jotischky s The Monastic World offers a rich, expansive survey of monasticism across the medieval era, moving beyond western Europe to explore traditions from Egypt to Britain. He includes both Latin and Orthodox practices, ensuring women s monastic experiences are not sidelined. Drawing on foundational texts and saints  lives, Jotischky reveals how small doctrinal differences often sparked deep conflict. From Benedictine traditions to radical ascetics   including pillar-dwelling abbots and naked holy fools   the book presents a strikingly diverse picture of monastic life. Famous figures like Bernard of Clairvaux appear, though military orders and mendicants are deliberately excluded to keep the scope manageable. While mainly chronological, the book is filled with thoughtful digressions. Not for beginners, The Monastic World best suits those with some grounding in medieval Christianity. For such readers, Jotischky s nuanced insights, especially his attention to eastern traditions, offer a rewarding and authoritative read.

Often sidelined by both classicists and Egyptologists, the Ptolemies emerge here in vivid detail. Wilkinson masterfully bridges the Greek-speaking Hellenistic world and traditional pharaonic Egypt, deftly handling the diverse sources needed to interpret this cultural fusion. He highlights both the dynasty s glories   Alexandria s splendour, intellectual achievements, monumental temples   and its flaws, including xenophobia, military blunders and poor leadership. Particularly strong is Wilkinson s analysis of the Egyptian context shaping Ptolemaic rule, revealing how Alexander the Great himself was transformed by pharaonic ideology, and his vivid account of Alexander at Luxor Temple underscores how Egypt influenced its conquerors. This richly written book is a vital contribution to Hellenistic scholarship and a superb guide to understanding the Ptolemies on their own, uniquely Egyptian terms. Reviewer: Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones is professor of ancient history at Cardiff University Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Military & War History Allies at War: The Politics of Defeating Hitler Tim Bouverie Tim Bouverie s engaging account of Second World War diplomacy reveals the complex relationship between the  Big Three : Franklin D Roosevelt, Josef Stalin and Winston Churchill   who, despite deep suspicions and rivalries, maintained a fa ade of friendship. Bouverie skilfully balances the ruthless power struggles with moments of genuine diplomatic cooperation, offering a fast-paced narrative backed by extensive archival research, mainly from British sources. He sheds light on lesser-known episodes like the Royal Navy s attack on the French fleet and explores varied neutralities in Ireland and Spain. The book s title, from Churchill s adage    There is only one thing worse than fighting with allies and that is fighting without them    captures the paradox of allied tensions. A striking example is the 1943 Tehran Conference, where Roosevelt s mocking camaraderie with Stalin humiliated Churchill, illustrating the alliance s underlying discord. Yet, Bouverie fairly acknowledges the strength of the Anglo-American partnership. Overall, the book is a nuanced study, suggesting modern leaders might benefit from better diplomatic performances, even if it s just pretending to be friends. Reviewer: Richard Toye is professor of history at the University of Exeter. His books include Winston Churchill: A Life in the News Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Friends in Youth: Choosing Sides in the English Civil War Minoo Dinshaw Dinshaw s book is a clear labour of love, exploring a neglected yet illuminating topic: the intertwined lives of Edward Hyde and Bulstrode Whitelocke, two key political figures on opposite sides of the English Civil War. Former friends with shared views on politics and religion, they both sought peace even as war divided them. Their contrasting fates   Hyde s rise and fall in royalist exile, Whitelocke s decline after parliamentary success   are skilfully traced. The book also examines their intellectual circle, notably Lord Falkland s Great Tew group, and captures the complexities of allegiance in a polarised age. Though marred by occasional factual errors, tangential misjudgements and a disjointed structure that ends prematurely with Falkland s death, it compensates with elegant prose and rich biographical and political insight. Ultimately, Dinshaw deepens our understanding of the Civil War s human dimensions and offers a thoughtful, engaging account deserving of praise. Reviewer: Ronald Hutton is professor of history at the University of Bristol Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Her Secret Service: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence Claire Hubbard-Hall Claire Hubbard-Hall s compelling and deeply researched book dismantles the sexist notion that secretaries in British intelligence needed only  good legs and a good upbringing . Instead, it reveals the vital, often overlooked roles women played in MI5, MI6 and the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during both world wars. From administrative offices to fieldwork, their impact was profound. Figures like Winifred Spink and Kathleen Pettigrew,  the real Miss Moneypenny , are brought vividly to life. The narrative is rich with stories of espionage, resilience and even absurdities, such as a dog-loving double agent nearly compromising D-Day. Hubbard-Hall avoids clich s, offering fresh insights and personal anecdotes that highlight both adventure and institutional injustice. Women s contributions were significant, yet often went unrewarded   still, they pushed boundaries and seized opportunities in a male-dominated world. This eloquent book is both a tribute and a correction to the historical record, an inspiring chronicle of women s grit, ingenuity, and unrecognised brilliance in wartime intelligence. Reviewer: Kate Vigurs is a historian and author. Her latest book is Mission Europe Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Rain of Ruin: Tokyo, Hiroshima and the Surrender of Japan Richard Overy Richard Overy, a leading authority on Second World War bombings, brings sharp insight to Rain of Ruin, a lucid account of the air war against Japan. Avoiding common pitfalls, he integrates Japanese perspectives and highlights the moral ambiguities of strategic bombing, including the development and use of the atomic bomb. Overy critiques the historical erasure of Japanese civilian suffering and challenges the simplistic  bombing equals surrender  narrative. His inclusion of personal testimonies, such as Tsukiyama Mihoro s   a young survivor who witnessed people spontaneously combust during the firebombing of Tokyo on 9-10 March 1945   underlines the brutality of the campaign. While he remains cautious in drawing conclusions, his work invites a reassessment of longstanding triumphalist accounts. The book also reveals surprising facts, like Britain s eagerness to bomb Japan and the early technical struggles of the B-29 programme. Overy s sober and balanced analysis marks a significant step towards a more inclusive and honest reckoning with the war in Asia, even if the controversy around Allied actions endures.

Once again, the lawyer and author Philippe Sands is on the trail of those accused of crimes against humanity, in this case SS officer Walther Rauff, who wound up in southern Chile, and that country s former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, who Sands himself encountered in a London courtroom at the turn of this century. Deftly blending history, law, memoir and travelogue, 38 Londres Street centres on two key questions: did Rauff assist in Pinochet s brutal repressions? And why was Pinochet able to leave Britain without standing trial for his alleged crimes? Beyond this, Sands also explores what the tales of these men tell us about the concepts of immunity and impunity, which remain as vitally important today as in the years covered by the book. Reviewer: Robert Attar, Editor of BBC History Magazine Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Patria: Lost Countries of South America Laurence Blair In this engaging and well-researched book, Laurence Blair takes readers on a sweeping journey across South America, blending travelogue with historical reflection. He brings to light lesser-known histories of resistance, forgotten kingdoms and unrealised political dreams, arguing that the continent s past still shapes its present. Blair challenges myths, showing the Amazon as a human-shaped environment and recounting how indigenous groups and escaped slaves forged autonomous societies. He focuses on the stories of the vanquished, whose perspectives, he suggests, reveal deeper truths than the victors  narratives. Yet while the book vividly captures South America s complexity and lost potential, it sometimes misses opportunities to probe deeper, particularly into how and why certain memories persist while others fade. Still, Blair s commitment to uncovering buried histories is admirable. His central question:  What might have been?  lingers, even as his answers remain partial. The result is a fascinating, thought-provoking read that connects past and present with insight and empathy. Reviewer: Tamar Herzog is Monroe Gutman professor of Latin American affairs at Harvard University Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The CIA Book Club: The Best-Kept Secret of the Cold War Charlie English The CIA Book Club uncovers the CIA s little-known campaign to smuggle banned books by authors like George Orwell, Virginia Woolf and Albert Camus into 1980s Poland, supporting the fight for democracy. While the CIA had long operated cultural initiatives across Eastern Europe, this effort intensified during the Cold War s final years, aligning with a global democratic surge. English s well-researched study offers an alternative to the CIA s usual image, focusing on subtle influence: money, propaganda and print. Figures like Miros aw Chojecki, key to Poland s Solidarity movement, received covert support, becoming cultural leaders in their own right. Though some, like Frances Stonor Saunders, accused the CIA of cultural manipulation, others viewed these efforts more favourably. English avoids simplistic conclusions, offering a nuanced social history of a covert book programme that, while not the Cold War s best-kept secret, is certainly one of its most compelling stories. Ultimately, the book s optimistic tone reflects Poland s relatively successful democratic transition. Reviewer: Richard J Aldrich is professor of international security at the University of Warwick Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org The Hohenzollerns and the Nazis: A History of Collaboration Stephan Malinowski Stephan Malinowski s compelling and meticulously researched book exposes the long-overlooked complicity of Germany s former royal family, the Hohenzollerns, in the rise of Nazism. While ex-Kaiser Wilhelm II faded into bitter exile, his son,  Crown Prince  Wilhelm, played a far more active and sinister role, aligning himself with far-right forces and later endorsing Adolf Hitler as a means of restoring the monarchy. Though Hitler cynically exploited the monarchists  support, he ultimately discarded them, leaving the Hohenzollerns politically irrelevant but still publicly loyal. Malinowski dismantles the post-war myth of aristocratic resistance to Nazism, showing instead how elites abetted the regime s consolidation of power. He also highlights the continued efforts of the Hohenzollerns to obscure this truth, including lawsuits aimed at silencing critics. This readable and courageous work should be essential reading for anyone interested in the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany and the ongoing struggle over historical memory and justice in reunified Germany.

Drawing on decades of interviews, including conversations with former Nazis and Holocaust survivors, Rees dives into the psychological and cultural forces that shaped the Nazi worldview. This isn t military history, it s a forensic investigation into the human mind under authoritarian pressure. Rees blends neuroscience, oral testimony and philosophy to illuminate how manipulation, fear and ideological fervour took root, particularly among the young. Central to Rees s book is his recollection of an encounter with an ex-Waffen SS officer who continued to revere Nazism despite all the devastation and genocidal mania it had inflicted. Sceptical of posterity s ability to learn lessons from the past, Rees instead offers  warnings  that encourage critical thinking over simplistic judgment. With sobering insight and personal urgency, this book reminds us that understanding the human mind is perhaps our best defence against repeating history s darkest chapters. Reviewer: Danny Bird, Content Producer of BBC History Magazine Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Cultural, Social & Intellectual History Every Valley: The Story of Handel s Messiah Charles King Charles King s Every Valley is a sweeping, erudite exploration of Handel s iconic oratorio, though not without its flaws. While not a Handel expert, King s diligent research and extensive bibliography lend credibility and his tripartite structure reflects the libretto s original organisation. He weaves five interconnected narratives with enthusiasm, offering rewarding historical context on 17th and 18th-century Britain, including the Glorious Revolution, colonialism and Enlightenment thinkers. His prose is engaging and his insights into character networks are often perceptive. However, tangents   such as the story of Ayuba Diallo   occasionally feel extraneous. Crucially, King falters on musical analysis; errors about performers and superficial commentary on Messiah s score betray a limited grasp of Handel s music. Nonetheless, despite its imprecision in fine musical detail, the book succeeds in painting a vivid, compelling portrait of the world in which Messiah was born. It s a flawed but imaginative and ambitious account. Reviewer: David Vickers is a lecturer at the Royal Northern College of Music Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org Holy Men of the Electromagnetic Age: A Forgotten History of the Occult Raphael Cormack In late 1924, author Arthur Conan Doyle hailed modern spiritualism as miraculous, drawing comparisons between s ance phenomena and biblical wonders. Doyle s recognition of the wonder of the unknown is reflected in the narratives presented in Holy Men of the Electromagnetic Age: A Forgotten History of the Occult, a book which explores the allure of the mystical during times of political and social upheaval by focusing on the transnational careers of two little-known figures: Tahra Bey, a self-styled fakir who captivated 1920s Paris, and Dr Dahesh, founder of a pan-religious doctrine blending hypnotism and spiritualism. Drawing on European and Arabic archival sources, Cormack does not shy away from acknowledging gaps in the records. Rather than weakening the narrative, the inclusion of uncorroborated events highlights the ways in which hearsay and word of mouth fuelled celebrity. By reviving these enigmatic  holy men,  the book offers a compelling cultural history of occultism in the Middle East, revealing how myths form from humanity s search for meaning in turbulent times. Cormack s study is both insightful and engaging, filling a notable gap in spiritualist scholarship. Reviewer: Fiona Snailham, lecturer in English literature at the University of Greenwich Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org London Uncanny: A Gothic Guide to the Capital in Weird History and Fiction Clive Bloom This idiosyncratic journey through fantasy and the paranormal begins at a dubious 1930s s ance in Sydenham and leaps through time, blending fact and fiction. From 1970s poltergeists in London s suburbs to Clive Barker s Hellraiser and Dickens s haunting Night Walks, the book is eclectic and pleasantly disorientating. Familiar supernatural tales like Spring-Heeled Jack and Aleister Crowley sit alongside surprising insights   such as TS Eliot dressing up as Dr Crippen and Montague Summers  Black Mass in Hampstead. The chaotic structure may frustrate those expecting a linear Gothic history, but it mirrors the disorder of the Gothic metropolis. Bloom, for example, uniquely intertwines Gothic literature with pop culture, including a David Bowie video and ABBA s ghostly holograms. The book concludes with Gilbert and George providingan eerie metaphor for urban Gothic in Spitalfields, a weird, compelling meditation on death and life intertwined. Reviewer: Lee Jackson, author of Dickensland: The Curious History of Dickens s London Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org No Ordinary Deaths: A People s History of Mortality Molly Conisbee Molly Conisbee s overview of British cultural life is a labour of love, blending personal stories with broader reflections on mortality. She explores England s pre- and post-Reformation customs, the 19th-century rise of funeral directors and modern ideas of a  good death . The book meanders through fascinating topics like industrialisation, Victorian mourning attire and social class, juxtaposing figures such as Edvard Munch and CS Lewis to show how grief shaped their work. Detailed chapters cover beliefs about body, soul and afterlife, plus mourning traditions across England, Wales and Ireland. Conisbee highlights harsh 1832 laws on medical dissection and addresses memorials for same-sex relationships. She is committed to telling the stories of those often overlooked by history. The book s eclectic flow reflects new research and folklore and is overall an engaging and thoughtful survey of death in British culture. Reviewer: Douglas Davies, professor in the Department of Theology and Religion, and director in the Centre for Death and Life Studies at Durham University Buy now on Amazon, Waterstones or Bookshop.org What Is Free Speech? The History of a Dangerous Idea Fara Dabhoiwala Fara Dabhoiwala s What Is Free Speech? is a masterful, revisionist history that exposes the myth of free speech absolutism. Dabhoiwala shows how appeals to free expression often mask selective, self-serving agendas. He argues that speech, far from being inherently free, has always been constrained by power, context and consequence. Foundational texts like Cato s Letters were partisan tools rather than principled defences, while later liberal icons such as JS Mill upheld freedoms that excluded colonial subjects. Though the book ranges globally, it centres on the US, where the First Amendment and tech giants have turned free speech into both a cultural battleground and a corporate shield. Dabhoiwala s conclusion is cautious: free speech debates are rarely about speech alone. His deeper point is clear: when someone claims to defend free speech absolutely, it s worth asking:  Whose speech, and to what end?

Exploring six institutions   market, state, community, religion, guild and family   she identifies how each has shaped epidemics and public health outcomes. Her analysis challenges myths, revealing more complex social dynamics whereby many of the wealthier inhabitants fled before quarantine was imposed. Ogilvie stresses that being poor in a pandemic is disadvantageous and highlights the importance not just of state power, but also its motivation, municipal structures and community cooperation. She shows how strong family ties can both help and hinder public health. The book concludes with cautious optimism: while no institution is perfect, societies have gradually improved their capacity to manage disease through innovation and coordination. Ogilvie avoids simple answers, but suggests that a balance of institutional diversity, social trust and an effective state offers the best defence against future pandemics.

Despite being exposed as a hoax, many clung to it because it felt true to their pre-existing beliefs about US war policy. Tinline shows how people often adopt beliefs based on comfort rather than truth, cherry-picking evidence or relying on feelings instead of facts. This hoax did not significantly alter public opinion or ignite conspiracy theorising but fits into a broader history of distrust. Tinline skilfully avoids grand claims or partisan bias, portraying extreme scepticism of the military-industrial complex as a bipartisan phenomenon. The book illustrates how beliefs sometimes arise not from reality but from what feels true, offering a thoughtful exploration of why Americans distrust official narratives.

Her husband Dr Hawley Harvey Crippen claimed Belle had gone to America to visit a dying relative. But before long, the seemingly respectable doctor's stories began to unravel and he went on the run, triggering an international manhunt that gripped the globe. In Story of a Murder, Hallie Rubenhold reconstructs this Edwardian cause c l bre. But, as in her previous book on the Jack the Ripper murders, The Five, the historian rewrites the narrative of this well-known case by placing the spotlight back onto the victim. She seeks to rehabilitate Belle s image from the misogynist press coverage of the day, and reveals how her life intersected with some of the darkest undercurrents of the age. A wholly gripping and forensically researched read for those who prefer true crime stories that offer enlightening social commentary over prurience or gore.

        "title": "The Peloponnesian War: Athens fights Sparta for dominance in ancient Greece",
        "content": "What and when was the Peloponnesian War? During the fifth century BC, battles raged on land and at sea in a protracted and bloody conflict between the two leading city-states of ancient Greece: Athens and Sparta. On one side was the supreme naval power of Athens and on the other the dominant Spartan army, with each heading an alliance that involved nearly every single Greek state. The Peloponnesian War of 431-404 BC would reshape the Hellenic world. Ad How do we know about the Peloponnesian War? The pre-eminent account of the war was written by Thucydides, who, despite serving as a general in the Athenian army, is remembered as a forefather of impartial historical study. He began his masterly work, The History of the Peloponnesian War, in the first year of the conflict, 431 BC,  believing that it would be a great war and more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it . Although the war, and Thucydides  work, came to be named after the peninsula of Greece where Sparta and some of its allies were located, the fighting was not confined to the Peloponnese. Battles also devastated the Aegean coastline, the island of Sicily and the Attica region. Were Athens and Sparta once allies? Yes, Athens and Sparta had fought side by side against the Persian invasions of Greece by Darius and then his son Xerxes in the early fifth century BC. Allied Greeks defeated them first at Marathon and then at the battles of Salamis, Mycale and Plataea, crushing the invasions. What was the Delian League? In the aftermath, in 478 BC, an alliance of Greek states called the Delian League was formed as protection against any future Persian attacks. Hundreds of states joined the Delian League, but it came to be so dominated by Athens that the Athenians effectively turned the alliance into an empire. Circling the Aegean Sea, the Athenian Empire built a huge navy of triremes   galleys, more than 30 metres long and with three lines of rowers down the length of each side, capable of great speeds   making Athens the dominant maritime power in Greece. Sparta grew alarmed at Athens  hegemony, which continued to expand due to regular tributes pouring in from across the empire. Athens also planned to rebuild the  Long Walls    miles of fortifications connecting the city to the harbour of Piraeus   so as to offer a link to the sea even at times of siege, making it yet more powerful. What was the Peloponnesian League? While Athens ruled the seas, Sparta had long headed its own alliance of states from the Peloponnese and central Greece   the Peloponnesian League   which commanded a stronger army thanks to much-feared and respected Spartan warriors. Why were the Spartans such great warriors? The lives of Spartan men were consumed by military service and commitment to winning glory in battle. Their constant and brutal training began at the age of seven, when boys would be sent from their families to undergo the ritual of agoge, a form of boot camp. This turned them into a fiercely disciplined and highly trained fighting force, feared across all Greece. During the Persian invasions of the fifth century BC, Sparta had shown its might when 300 warriors and an alliance of Greek city-states, led by King Leonidas, had fought the Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae. Why did the Peloponnesian War start? Fighting had raged for decades before the Peloponnesian War, as Athens and Sparta got involved in the conflicts of other states or exploited circumstances to further their own advantage. This period, sometimes called the First Peloponnesian War, ended with the Thirty Years  Peace in the winter of 446/45 BC   although the uneasy peace lasted only half that time. Athens continued its aggression during the 430s, siding against Corinth, an ally of Sparta, by sending ships to assist its own ally, Corcyra, at the battle of Sybota. Athens then further tested the limits of the peace treaty by laying siege to the Corinthian colony of Poteidaia and issuing, in c432 BC, the Megarian Decree, which essentially imposed a trade embargo on another long-time Spartan ally, Megara. Even then, Sparta did not immediately retaliate, as it honoured the peace and was unready for a long conflict. But war was brewing. What was Sparta s plan? When war finally broke out in 431 BC, Sparta had the lofty aims of liberating Greece from Athenian tyranny and dismantling its empire. Attacking over land, King Archidamus II led an army of hoplites, armed with spears and shields, into the Attica peninsula, leaving destruction and chaos in his wake and robbing Athens of vital resources. He hoped to provoke the enemy and draw them out from their fortified walls into open battle, but Athens refused to take the bait thanks to the guidance of influential statesman Pericles. Instead, Athens used its superior navy to harass Spartan ships and make its own assaults in the Peloponnese. Were there really only 300 Spartans at the battle of Thermopylae? It is true there only 300 Spartan soldiers fought at Thermopylae, but they were not alone... Were the Athenians right not to invite open battle? Even though it may have been regarded as cowardice by the enemy, remaining behind the walls was a savvy move. But disaster struck when Athens was ravaged by plague. Outbreaks wiped out a huge proportion of the population   perhaps as many as a quarter, or around 100,000 people   and decimated the Athenian leadership. Pericles himself succumbed in 429 BC. The plague is thought to have come from sub-Saharan Africa, reaching Athens through the port of Piraeus; the added burden of people from Attica arriving to escape the Spartans only served to spread the disease faster. The fortifications that were keeping Athens safe in war were now keeping the plague inside. The Spartans did not approach the city for fear of catching it themselves, but they simultaneously refused the Athenian calls for peace. Yet Sparta failed to take advantage of a much-weakened Athens as its campaigns on land and sea suffered setbacks. Then when the island of Lesbos looked like rising up in revolt against Athens, which resulted in a blockade being put in place, the Spartans failed to come to their assistance and the island surrendered. In 427 BC, however, Sparta did capture the strategic Athenian ally of Plataea following a lengthy siege. Did either side gain the advantage? With the cautious Pericles gone (he died in 429 BC) and the hawkish Cleon taking over, Athens embarked on a more aggressive strategy. One of the finest generals of the day, Demosthenes, commanded raids on the Peloponnese; he was given a fleet with which he occupied and fortified the remote headland of Pylos; and repelled the assault to win it back. The building of outposts on the Peloponnese created a different problem for Sparta: the Athenians used them to attract runaway helots, or slaves, meaning there were fewer people to work the fields and a higher chance of a slave revolt. As more battles went against them Sparta began suing for peace itself, until terms became more favourable when it achieved victories of its own. The most significant came in 422 BC with the capture of the Athenian colony of Amphipolis. The man Athens had sent to protect it was Thucydides   for his failure, he was exiled and dedicated his time to his impartial history of the war. The distinguished Spartan general Brasidas died in the fight for Amphipolis, as did Athens  Cleon, leaving the way clear for those, on both sides, who desired peace. How long did peace last? The resulting Peace of Nicias   named after the man from Athens sent to negotiate the treaty   was signed in 421 BC. Intended to last 50 years, it ended up lasting just six. In fact, fighting never really stopped, as both sides spent those years trying to win over smaller states, or watched on as allies formed coalitions of their own and kept the conflict going. In 415 BC, war officially resumed when Athens launched a massive assault on Sicily with the aim of capturing Syracuse, a powerful city-state which controlled a large share of Mediterranean trade. If successful, Athens could claim its abundant resources. The expedition started badly, however, as the Athenian commander Alcibiades, who had been accused of the serious crime of impiety and ordered back to Athens, defected to Sparta. Syracuse, with Spartan aid, broke the blockade around Sicily and time and time again defeated the invading army until it was crushed, even in a sea battle. By 413 BC, the few who had not been killed or enslaved were forced to retreat. The invasion was a total disaster for Athens, a major blow to morale and prestige. Did the failure of the Sicily expedition swing the tide? Back in Greece, Sparta certainly looked to be closer to victory over the next few years as it occupied Attica once again and several revolts broke out against Athenian rule. Athens itself was in political turmoil as governments were overthrown and replaced. What s more, the Persians had chosen to back Sparta as they saw the Athenian empire as a threat. And yet, the Spartans and their allies were slow to act, allowing Athens to rebuild and put into service its reserve navy. Athens started winning naval battles again, so much so that by 406 BC, it had actually won back parts of the empire thought to have been lost. What effect did the Peloponnesian War have on democracy in ancient Greece? Find out in our guide to the history of democracy How did the war finally end? It would be a naval victory that won the Peloponnesian War after 27 years, but not an Athenian one. Sparta managed to build an imposing fleet of hundreds of triremes, thanks to Persian money and resources, and put to sea. In 405 BC, the fleet   under the skilled command of Lysander   crushed the Athenians at the battle of Aegospotami, near the Hellespont. Lysander then advanced to Athens itself and forced the city-state to surrender the following year. The victorious Spartans ordered the Long Walls to be demolished, forbade Athens from building a fleet larger than 12 ships and demanded Athens pay them tribute. The Athenian empire was no more; Sparta had emerged as the dominant power in Greece. What happened in Greece after the war? Sparta s position did not last long. It became embroiled in too many conflicts for its army to handle, and its hold over Greece ended with defeat by Thebes and its Boeotian League allies at the battle of Leuctra in 371 BC. Nearly a century of the Peloponnesian War, followed by continued fighting and divisions, had left Greece vulnerable. This instability was exploited by Philip II of Macedon, who invaded and defeated the city-states   laying the foundations of a Macedonian empire, which would grow to an unprecedented size in the reign of his son, Alexander the Great.

        "title": "Women in ancient Greece: what were their lives like?",
        "content": "In popular depictions of ancient Greece, the mythical Amazons loom large. A tribe of independent, fierce and powerful warriors, their legend is inspired by real nomadic women who lived in the Eurasian Steppe   and it s very revealing about the roles women played in Greek society. For the ancients, these strong women represented a threat to the patriarchal order, and most versions of the myth see them tricked and overcome by the hero Herakles, the ultimate symbol of masculine strength. Ad For the ancient Greek ideal, you might instead look to Penelope, the wife of Odysseus in Homer's Odyssey. Beset by more than a hundred suitors, she remains calm, dedicated to her domestic duties, and, most importantly by the standard of the day, loyal to her husband. When considering the lives of ancient Greek women, though, it s important, says classicist Paul Cartledge, to distinguish between different Greek city-states. While many sources of the period come from Athens, we cannot assume that women s role in Athenian society was representative of the lives of women across the rest of Greece. The lives of Spartan women would have been very different from their Athenian sisters. EXPLORE more on this topic | Women's history Another key difference is status. While no woman would have found themselves on equal footing with men in ancient Greek society, the lives of women would have greatly depended upon how wealthy their father or husband was. Greater wealth did not necessarily mean they enjoyed greater freedom, though.  If you were a woman in Athens, the richer you were, broadly speaking, the more confined you were,  explains Cartledge. Here, we take a closer look at the different elements of women s lives in ancient Greece... In Homer s Odyssey, Penelope demonstrates her loyalty to her husband when beset by suitors. (Photo by Print Collector/Getty Images) Motherhood and the home The lives of ancient Greek women were largely confined to the home. Men would serve the polis   state   while the domain of women was the oikos   the household. The women's quarters of a house, the gynaikon, were located on the upper floors, and wives were expected to bear and raise children and undertake domestic duties. Marriage itself would usually take place when a kore (maiden) was between 13 and 15 years old; only after the birth of her first child would she technically become a gyne (woman). In ancient Greek society, the reputation of women was in all cases to be preserved. Athenian historian Thucydides, writing in the fifth century BC, famously asserted of women:  The greatest glory is to be least talked about among men, whether in praise or blame.  This meant that many wealthy Athenian women were supervised and chaperoned by male relatives when outside, and in some cases not allowed to leave the house at all. For Spartan women, however, life was different from their Athenian counterparts. They rarely married before the age of 20, while motherhood gave them enhanced status; raising future warriors was considered one of the most important roles in Spartan society. Women in Sparta (and in Delphi, Gortyn, Thessaly and Megara) could also own land, and because of military campaigns that took men away for long periods of time, they often had control of their own homes. Work Though life for Athenian women held many restrictions, religion provided a viable career path for those hailing from aristocratic backgrounds. In fact, the most senior religious office of the state   high priestess of the Athena Polias   was a female role. This, and other similar positions within Athens  religious cults, would have afforded the officeholders a certain degree of public influence, and in some cases, payment and property. There is also the story of a pioneering Athenian midwife named Agnodice. According to legend, Agnodice   concerned at the high number of local women dying in childbirth   decided to disguise herself as a man and study medicine. According to some versions of the tale, the midwife would  reveal  her true gender to patients in order to gain their trust, leading envious male doctors to accuse her of seducing pregnant women. While the existence of Agnodice is still debated by scholars, her legend has been used by women to support their role in medicine since the 17th century. Read more about childbirth through history, with our A-Z of midwifery and childbirth However, a more common   and certainly real   profession for many women of the time was that of sex worker. Of these, it's known that there were two particular groups of workers, called hetairai and pornai. A hetaira would have been able to read and write, and been employed to work for the higher classes in society. They would have also served as a companion   perhaps more comparable to the role of a geisha in Japanese culture. Meanwhile, pornai (from which we get the modern word 'pornography') would have spent their time working in a brothel and were expected to serve all levels of the city's men, from the elite to members of the lower classes. Education and politics Much like their greater freedoms as mothers and within the domestic sphere, Spartan women also had better access to education than their counterparts in other Greek city-states. While their early education would have taken place at home rather than in a school, women were seen as a key part of Spartan society and allowed to make business transactions. One famous example of the greater opportunities available to Spartan women (albeit noble women) concerns the fifth-century BC Spartan queen, Gorgo. The only known child of Cleomenes I, king of Sparta, Gorgo (who later married King Leonidas I) was schooled in literature, culture and physical education   the latter of which included wrestling and combat skills. Indeed, Gorgo was noted by fifth-century BC Greek historian Herodotus as a woman of great wisdom; she advised her father on military matters, and is sometimes credited as being one of history s first cryptanalysts. For Athenian women, however, there was no such freedom to participate in their city-state's political and social life. Even if they were educated in some manner of business dealings, they could not by law enter into any contract beyond the value of one medimnos of barley   a small amount that ensured any transaction was restricted to domestic purchases. And while Athens is lauded as the birthplace of democracy, Athenian women were never true  adults  in the eyes of the law. This inequality had long echoes into the 20th century; women in modern Greece didn t have the unconditional opportunity to vote until 1952. Arts and culture While women were generally excluded from the arts, one of ancient Greece s most celebrated poets was a woman named Sappho. Born in either Eressos or Mytilene on the island of Lesbos, likely to a wealthy family (given that she could read and write), Sappho s lyrics and poetry were remarkable for their candid depictions of passion and sexuality   particularly between women. The seventh-century BC poet was even dubbed by Plato as the  Tenth Muse , and honoured on ancient coins. It s also possible to find evidence of women artists, such as Kora, who was from Sicyon and active around 650 BC. Along with her artist father, Dibutades, she is credited with the invention of relief modelling. According to a popular tale, Kora fell in love with one of her father s apprentices, and traced the outline of his face in charcoal on a wall. Dibutades later filled the outline in clay, creating the first relief. Kora apparently traced the outline of her lover s face on a wall as he slept. (Photo by The Print Collector/Heritage Images via Getty Images) Another example of a woman who broke the mould was the fifth-century BC artist Timarete, who, according to the Roman author Pliny the Elder,  scorned the duties of women and practised her father s art .

        "title": "A brief history of sex and sexuality in Ancient Greece",
        "content": "Please note this article contains sexually explicit content Ad In the beginning was sex. To the ancient Greek mythologisers, sexuality, love and sex were inextricably connected with the creation of the earth, the heavens and the underworld. Greek myth was a theogony of incest, murder, polygamy and intermarriage in which eroticism and fertility were elemental; they were there right from the start, demonstrating woman s essential reproductive role in securing the cosmos, extending the human race and ensuring the fecundity of nature. Simultaneously, Zeus, the top god, wasted no time in asserting his dominance over the other gods (both male and female). His cavalier attitude towards female sexuality, as manifested in serial rape and seduction (Zeus raped Leda, daughter of the Aetolian king Thestius, in the guise of a swan; raped Danae, a princess of Argos, disguised as the rain, and raped Ganymede, a male mortal) set a precedent for centuries of mortal male domination and female subservience. The depiction of Hera [wife of Zeus and queen of the ancient Greek gods] as a distracting, duplicitous and deceptive woman opened the door for centuries of male insecurity about women, and misogyny.

(Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) The Minoans Our earliest evidence for ancient Greek sexuality comes with the Minoans (approximately 3650 to 1400 BC). Women at this time were only partly dressed   the main items of clothing were short-sleeved robes that had layered, flounced skirts; these were open to the navel, leaving the breasts exposed. Women also wore a strapless fitted bodice, the first fitted garments known in history. Women were typically depicted as having a tiny waist, full breasts, long hair and full hips: to our eyes and ears this is sexually charged and provocative, but to a Minoan probably not so. On the contrary, the voluptuous figure may have been a means by which women, and their artists, expressed their gender and status rather than male artists simply idealising female sexuality for their own delectation, satisfying a prurient male voyeurism. Women in Minoan Crete, it seems, were able to celebrate their femininity. The body shape described above re-emerged during the mid-late 1800s, when women laced themselves into tight corsets to make their waists small and wore hoops under their skirts to exaggerate the proportions of their lower body. Minoan civilization, 2nd millennium BC. Reconstruction of the fresco of the procession, found in the Palace of Knossos. Detail of young men carrying offerings to a goddess. (Photo by DEA/G DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini/Getty Images) Pederasty Pederasty in Greece probably originated with the Cretans. Cretan pederasty was an early form of paedophilia that involved the ritual kidnapping (harpagmos) of a boy from an elite background by an aristocratic adult male, with the consent of the boy's father. This adult male was known as philetor, befriender; the boy was kleinos, glorious. The man took the boy out into the wilderness, where they spent two months hunting and feasting with friends learning life skills, respect and responsibility. It is generally assumed that the philetor would begin having sex with the boy soon after taking him out into the wilds. If the boy was pleased with how this went he changed his status from kleinos to parastates, or comrade, signifying that he had metaphorically fought in battle alongside his philetor; he then went back to society and lived with him. The philetor would shower the boy with expensive gifts, including an army uniform, an ox to be sacrificed to Zeus, and a drinking goblet   a symbol of spiritual accomplishment. At the same time, according to the geographer Strabo, the boy then had to choose between continuing with or putting an end to the relationship with his abductor, and whether to denounce the man if he had misbehaved in any way. Satyrs and satyriasis Satyrs, depicted in Greek mythology as beast-like men with a horse s tail, donkey s ears, upturned pug nose, receding hairline and erect penis, have a reputation for being inveterate masturbators with a penchant for rape, sodomy and necrophilia. A satyr was a true party animal with an insatiable passion for dancing, women and wine. Satyrs were experts on the aulos, a phallic-shaped double reed instrument; some vase paintings show satyrs ejaculating while playing, and one even shows a bee deftly avoiding the discharge in mid-flight. Another vase illustrates a hirsute satyr masturbating while shoving a dildo of sorts into his anus. Apart from inspiring some wonderful depictions on ceramics, satyrs have left us the word satyriasis, which means hypersexuality   classified today in the World Health Organisation s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) as satyriasis in men and as nymphomania in women (in 1951 it was still listed as a  sexual deviation ). The word satyriasis appears frequently in the works of medical authors of the Roman empire who describe a condition no doubt prevalent for centuries previously. For example, Soranus contends that the  itching  felt in the genitals that makes women  touch themselves  increases their sexual urge and causes  mental derangement  and an immodest desire for a man. Greek physician Galen called it  uterine fury , furor uterinus. Statue of Silenus, a satyr and minor god of drunkenness, dated from 540-530 BC. National Archaeological Museum, Athens, Greece. (Photo by Prisma/UIG/Getty Images) Achilles and Briseis Epic [the Iliad] gives us one of our earliest surviving expressions of heterosexual love; it comes from a rather surprising source   from battle-hardened, Homeric war hero, alpha male Achilles. Achilles uncharacteristically wears his heart on his sleeve when he reveals how much he loves Briseis in Book 9 of the Iliad, referring to her as if she were his wife. The beautiful and intelligent Briseis first encountered Achilles when he ruthlessly slaughtered her father, mother, three brothers and husband during a Greek assault on Troy, before taking her as war booty. Achilles wiped out Briseis  family so that she was utterly bereft and had only him to focus on. To Achilles it was simply the right and decent thing to do to love your woman   an attitude, of course, that may have been at odds with some of the male audience members of Homer s epic over the years. Masturbation To the ancient Greeks masturbation was a normal and healthy substitute for other sexual pleasures   a handy  safety valve  against destructive sexual frustration. This may explain why there are so few references to it in the literature: it was common practice and did not merit much attention. Nevertheless, it may well have been deemed, publicly at least, to be the preserve of slaves, lunatics and other people considered to be lower down the social pecking order. Elite opinion would have regarded it, literally, as a waste of time and semen, since it was one of the prime cultural responsibilities of the Greek male to further the family line and extend the oikos, the household. One term for masturbation in ancient Greece was anaphlao, a verb that comic playwright Aristophanes disparagingly used to describe the Spartans, who were  wankers , in his comedy Lysistrata. The decidedly odd Greek philosopher Diogenes the Cynic routinely masturbated in public and defended his actions by saying  If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly . Interestingly, Diogenes attracted censure not just for masturbating in public but also for eating in the agora   indicating perhaps that masturbating in a public place was regarded as no more serious a crime than eating in a public place. Other ancient civilisations celebrated masturbation too. For example, a clay figurine of the 4th millennium BC from Malta shows a woman masturbating. In ancient Sumer [the first ancient urban civilization in the historical region of southern Mesopotamia, modern-day southern Iraq] masturbation   either solitary or with a partner   was thought to enhance potency. In ancient Egypt male masturbation when performed by a god was considered a creative or magical act: Atum was said to have created the universe by masturbating, and the ebb and flow of the Nile was attributed to the frequency of his ejaculations. Egyptian Pharaohs were required to masturbate ceremonially into the Nile. Effeminacy and cross-dressing Effeminacy in men was considered beyond the pale   para phusin or  outside nature . It implied passivity and receptiveness, epithumein paschein   both weaknesses contrary to the proper sexual conduct of the Greek male who ought to be virile, dominant, penetrating and thrusting. Cross-dressing had some surprising advocates. The heroic alpha-male Hercules, according to the Roman poet Ovid, indulged in a bout of cross-dressing with Omphale [queen of Lydia to whom Hercules was enslaved] Hercules put on Omphale s clothes and Omphale dressed up in typically Herculean lion skin and wealded his club, which was symbolic of manhood and power. Surprisingly, perhaps,  lion-hearted  Achilles too was not averse to a spot of dressing up in women s clothes, if it saved him from the call-up for the Trojan war. Hercules and Omphale. Hercules was sold as a slave to Omphale, queen of Lydia, to atone for the murder of Iphitos. Hercules was forced to wear Omphale's clothes and jewellery. (Photo by Imagno/Getty Images) Pseudo-Apollodorus, in the Bibliotheca [a compendium of Greek myths and heroic legends], tells us that to help her son dodge the draft Thetis [Achilles  mother] concealed him at the court of Lycomedes, king of Skyros. Disguised as a girl Achilles lived among Lycomedes' daughters under the pseudonym Pyrrha, the red-haired girl. Achilles raped one of the daughters, Deidamia, and with her fathered a son, Neoptolemus. Odysseus was told by the prophet Calchas that the Greeks would not capture Troy without Achilles' support, so he went to Skyros masquerading as a peddler selling women's clothes and jewellery with a shield and spear secreted in his wares. Achilles instantly took up the spear; Odysseus saw through his disguise as Pyrrha and persuaded him to join the Greek forces. Another famous alpha male, Julius Caesar, was also involved in cross-dressing: apparently, aged 20, he lived the life of a girl in the court of King Nicomedes IV and was later referred to behind his back as the 'queen of Bithynia', and  every woman's man and every man's woman . Suetonius described his long-fringed sleeves and loose belt as a bit odd, prompting statesman and dictator Sulla to warn everyone to  beware of the boy with the loose belt .

Ad Follow the links below to jump to the highlights in each section: Who is Alexander the Great? Alexander III of Macedon, known to most as Alexander the Great, inherited his kingdom (in modern-day Greece) at the age of 20, following the assassination of his father, Philip II, in 336 BC. After suppressing his enemies on home soil, Alexander moved quickly to reassert Macedonian power in Greece and to conquer the Persian empire, achieving victories across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt without suffering a single defeat. The next eight years of campaigning saw him create an empire that stretched across three continents and covered around two million square miles   south into Egypt and as far east as the Indian Punjab. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history s most successful military commanders   but died in his prime at Babylon in June 323 BC, just before his 33rd birthday. Alternate history: what if Alexander the Great had lived longer? Professor Paul Cartledge considers whether an older Alexander the Great could have formed an even bigger empire or grown even more impressive reputation... Alexander the Great: the big questions answered Paul Cartledege, AG Leventis Professor of Greek Culture Emeritus at the University of Cambridge, gives us his take on Alexander the Great... What made Alexander the Great such a brilliant military leader? He combined immense personal charisma and bravery (he often led his troops from the front). Plus he had a priceless ability to identify the key moment in a battle and act decisively to ensure he won that moment. Where does Alexander the Great stand in the pantheon of great commanders? Up there in Division 1, with Napoleon and Genghis Khan. He won the four key battles of his great campaign: at Granicus, Issus, Gaugamela and, for me the most impressive, Hydaspes. While Darius III of Persia commanded a motley crew of multi-ethnic forces, at Hydaspes Raja Porus led largely Indian ethnic forces fighting on their own terrain for their own terrain. And, of course, they had elephants! What was Alexander the Great s greatest failing as a leader? One criticism is that he didn t invest enough time and energy in the peaceful administration of his diverse empire. One symptom is that, at his death in 323 BC, he had three wives but no male heir yet born. In addition, he was too impetuous, too prone to believe alleged conspiracies against his life and too trusting in subordinates who let him down. Was Alexander the Great gay? As he had sex with both males and females, he was what we d call bisexual. He married three times and sired at least two sons, one legitimate (born to his first wife, Roxana, after his death). Possibly his closest and warmest personal relationship was with a man   his near-contemporary Hephaestion, a noble Macedonian who, like him, was taught by Aristotle. A brief history of sex and sexuality in Ancient Greece Paul Chrystal explores the many layers of sex and sexuality in various Greek societies   from prostitution to pillow talk... What motivated Alexander the Great to undertake his extraordinary campaign in the east? It probably never occurred to him not to carry on where his father had been forced to leave off. Probably, too, his Greek-style education and his love of Homer s writings gave him the notion of trying to emulate his boyhood hero, Achilles (the mythical Trojan War was, after all, a battle between Greeks and Orientals). Did Alexander the Great truly believe he was a god? Without doubt he believed he was descended literally from more than one god, and he almost certainly demanded to be worshipped by his subjects as if he were himself a living god. Was he a megalomaniac? Yes, inevitably. No one but a megalomaniac could possibly have conceived, let alone pulled off, his greatest feats. Alexander the Great: his life in 17 moments Understand why Alexander the Great casts such as shadow in history with writer Spencer Day's highlights of his life... 20/21 July 356 BC | Alexander the Great is born He is born in the Macedonian capital of Pella. His father is the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his mother is the politically ambitious Olympias of Epirus. 343 BC | Alexander begins his education with Aristotle Alexander travels to the Temple of the Nymphs in Mieza to be educated by the celebrated Greek philosopher Aristotle. There he develops a fascination with the exploits of mythical Greek heroes such as Achilles. October 336 BC | Alexander becomes king of Macedon Philip II is assassinated by his bodyguard while attending wedding celebrations in Aegae. Alexander   who has since come under suspicion for ordering the killing   becomes king of Macedon in his father s stead. May 334 BC | Alexander crosses the Hellespont With an army about 50,000 strong, Alexander crosses the Hellespont to Asia Minor. His goal: to seize Persia and become the master of Asia. May 334 BC | Alexander visits Troy Alexander journeys to the town made famous by Homer s epic poem the Iliad, to pay his respects to some of the heroes he believes are buried there, among them Achilles. May 334 BC | The battle of the Granicus The Persian king, Darius III, sends an army to confront the Macedonians on the banks of the Granicus river. Alexander secures victory following an audacious cavalry charge into the heart of the enemy   which he leads himself. 5 November 333 BC | The battle of Issus Darius attacks Alexander near Issus. The Persian army fares no better than at Granicus   a whirlwind Greek cavalry assault proves decisive and Darius flees the battlefield. 332 BC | Divine intervention at Siwa Oasis After leading a party of men in a perilous journey across the Saharan desert, Alexander visits the oracle at the Siwa Oasis, where he asks her if he is the son of the god Amon. He later suggests that she answered in the affirmative. July 332 BC | The storming of Tyre In a masterclass of ingenuity and resolve, Alexander storms Tyre following a seven-month siege, which had seen his men build a half-mile-long causeway out to the island. He then oversees the slaughter of 8,000 of the city s inhabitants. 331 BC | The founding of Alexandria Alexander founds Alexandria on Egypt s north coast. The city goes on to become one of the Mediterranean s most important ports. Today nearly five million people call it home 1 October 331 BC | The battle of Gaugamela Darius brings an enormous army to the field near Gaugamela in modern Iraq. What follows is the decisive battle in Alexander s conquest of Persia. Though Alexander s army is perhaps less than half the size of its Persian foe, the Macedonian troops  superior training and resolve   not to mention their commander s peerless tactical agility   prevails once more. Darius flees the battlefield again. But this time there is no reprieve: soon after, he is slaughtered by his own men. 330 BC | The looting of Persepolis The Macedonian army descends on the Persian capital of Persepolis and, in an orgy of drink-fuelled violence, loots the city and burns its great palace to the ground 327 BC | The siege of Aornos In another masterclass of improvisation, Alexander seizes Aornos, a seemingly impregnable stronghold blocking his entry into India. Alexander s solution is to seize the hill opposite and drive the enemy out of their encampment with his catapults May 326 BC | The battle of the Hydaspes The powerful Indian raja Porus confronts the Macedonians on the banks of the river Hydaspes. In an incredibly hard-fought battle, Alexander s phalanx gets the better of an Indian army that includes 200 elephants. Hydaspes is the last great battle of Alexander s campaign in the east   but it is also the bloodiest, pushing the Macedonian army to breaking point 326 BC | Alexander's men mutiny Drenched by Indian monsoon rains and traumatised by the carnage at Hydaspes, Alexander s men decide they have had enough and mutiny. Eight years and 17,000 miles into his epic journey east, Alexander is forced to accept that his remarkable campaign of conquest is over 324 BC | The second mutiny Troops mutiny again at Opis (roughly modern Baghdad): faced with insurrection, Alexander cashiers 10,000 of his mainly Macedonian troops and stages a huge banquet of reconciliation. 323 BC | Alexander the Great dies Alexander passes at Babylon: his cause of death is unclear; some theories suggest that he was assassinated by poison. Alexander the Great's Empire How did a young king from Macedon inspire his modest army to conquer a domain that spanned the ancient world? Writer Jeremy Pound reveals the secrets behind the man   and his downfall When, on 1 October 331 BC, Alexander III of Macedon faced the massed Persian forces of Darius III at Gaugamela, the outcome should have been a foregone conclusion. Comprising 34,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry, Alexander s Greek army was by no means small   but Darius commanded a mighty cavalry numbering 34,000 and, it is reckoned, more than 200,000 infantry. What s more, the hot and dusty plain   in what is now northern Iraq   was home turf for the Persians. Alexander s men, in contrast, had been on the march for over three years and were over a thousand miles from home. In fact, the battle was indeed a rout   but not in the expected way. It was the Persians who were crushed, not the numerically inferior Greeks. We will never know the exact figures, but it s believed that around 50,000 Persians were killed in the battle, compared with just 1,000 or so Greeks. With his vast forces in disarray, Darius fled. He survived   for now   but his reign was effectively finished, as was the once-great Persian empire, which had stretched from Libya in the west to the Indus Valley in the east. The way now lay open for Alexander to press on eastwards and establish his own empire. At just 25, he was the most powerful man in the world   the Great, indeed. Brilliant military tactician, savvy politician, courageous and accomplished fighter   in terms of leadership skills, Alexander had the lot. Nor did it hurt to be the son of a king who had already set in motion the most significant shift in power in Greek history. Peloponnesian War: Athens fights Sparta Read about another major shift in power   the 5th century BC Peloponnesian War between the Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues. Here's why the war began, who won and how, and why it prompted a reshaping of the Hellenic world... Alexander the Great's early life and reign Alexander was born in July 356 BC to King Philip II of Macedon   by all accounts a thoroughly unpleasant man, but also a mightily effective leader. In the space of just a few years, Philip transformed his state from a small, peripheral kingdom in northern Greece into an unstoppable war machine. In 339 BC, he won a crushing victory over Athens and its allies at Chaeronea, ensuring that Macedon effectively ruled all Greece. Alexander won his spurs fighting alongside his father, earning plaudits for his bravery at Chaeronea, but would himself soon have the opportunity to rule. Suspiciously soon, in fact   it s been suggested by some historians that Alexander might have been behind the assassination of Philip II in 336 BC, killed by one of his own bodyguards at a family wedding. By fair means or foul, at the age of 20, Alexander III became ruler of Greece   and the ruthlessness he displayed in cementing that position bore all the hallmarks of his father. He put down unrest in the north of his kingdom with brutal speed and, when Thebes rashly declared independence from Macedonia, his reprisal was savage: the city was burnt to the ground, its people either slaughtered or sold into slavery. But Alexander was not merely ruthless. He was also bright enough to know that brute force alone would not keep the diverse collection of states under his power in check. If his study of history had taught him anything   and, with the philosopher and scientist Aristotle as his teacher, he would certainly have been well schooled   it would have been that nothing unites states and their people more than having a reviled common enemy. In 490 BC and 480 BC, the Greeks, who had been fighting among themselves, had joined forces to repel invasions by the Persians under Darius I and Xerxes I. Now, a century and a half later, Alexander saw an opportunity to turn the tables, and planned a united Greek invasion of Persia. The expedition that began in spring 334 BC, when Alexander s forces set off from the Greek mainland, would change the course of history. It was not just his military victories against the odds that defy belief, but also his achievements in overcoming daunting geographical obstacles   from vast African deserts to the precipitous mountain trails of the Hindu Kush in the western Himalaya   in a journey that would eventually cover about 20,000 miles over the course of 11 years. The initial impetus and rallying call for the expedition may have been that long-held grudge against the Persians, but Alexander also had an ulterior motive: he was determined to reach the end of the Earth and the great ocean that he believed lay beyond. Certainly, no one could accuse him of a lack of ambition. Alexander the Great Before the Tomb of Achilles. Found in the collection of Louvre, Paris. (Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Early conquests Alexander s all-conquering tour began when he crossed into Asia Minor (Anatolia, today part of Turkey) before heading down the eastern Mediterranean coast through Syria into Egypt, looping back towards the Red Sea then continuing eastward through Assyria   where he triumphed at Gaugamela   Mesopotamia, Persia and Bactria, and through the Hindu Kush to the Indus River. If those ancient names seem unfamiliar, look in a modern atlas and tally the list of countries his army traversed to get an idea of the enormity of the achievement: Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, India. Alexander s forces triumphed in a succession of major battles, not all of them as quick and decisive as Gaugamela. The crucial Mediterranean port city of Tyre (now in Lebanon) was conquered only after a siege that lasted seven months. Cities galore were founded en route, from Alexandria in Egypt (today, the country s second biggest city) to Alexandria Eschate ( Alexandria the Farthest ) in Tajikistan and Alexandria Bucephalus, named for the Macedonian s beloved horse, in what s now the Pakistani Punjab. The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: what happened to them? As the pinnacle of antiquity s ability in engineering, architecture and artistic beauty, the seven wonders of the ancient world still cast their shadow over human endeavour today. And one of them was in Alexandria... Not everyone met Alexander s army with stern resistance. Many welcomed their conqueror with open arms and, often, lavish gifts. All, however, soon became part of an empire of unprecedented scope   covering over two million square miles, it linked East with West for the first time in history. Enclaves of Greek culture persist in remote areas of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent even today, legacies of the Macedonian s exploits over two millennia ago. No figure from ancient history continues to loom so large in the literature and culture of so many different peoples   in many he is deified, in many others he is utterly reviled. But how did he do it? How did Alexander inspire and maintain allegiance and endurance in his troops as he led them on an expedition that, at times, must have seemed not just ambitious but downright deluded? Providing the military brains behind unlikely victories such as that at Gaugamela helped   everyone likes to be on the side of a winner, particularly one who is seemingly invincible. Nor was Alexander the sort of general to monitor success from afar. Various sources depict him fighting courageously on the frontline. Alexander knew all about the effectiveness of what today is dubbed  shock and awe . The shock was simple enough   if you crossed him, he was merciless. Alexander s path across Asia was a bloody one, strewn with the bodies not just of enemies but also of former friends whom he came to mistrust, and even the likes of doctors and priests whom he believed had let him down. The awe, meanwhile, came from creating an aura of one directed from above, encouraging the belief that his rise towards global domination was preordained. To that end, he employed tactics designed to convince all around him of his credentials. The Greeks were a suspicious and religious bunch, so Alexander made a point of consulting oracles   which would inevitably confirm that his actions enjoyed divine approval; he even undertook a perilous eight-day trek across the desert to the oracle at Siwa in Egypt. And Alexander s propagandist Callisthenes was invariably there to elaborate, enhance and disseminate the news far and wide. Much of the success of the Alexander  myth  is down to the handiwork of Callisthenes   an exceptional spin doctor   from the famous account of loosening the Gordian Knot to the touching tales of Alexander s bond with Bucephalus. Many people were led to believe that Alexander was, indeed, a god. End of the road Eventually, though, even the most successful conqueror meets his nemesis. Alexander s came in the form of the River Ganges. By 326 BC, long years on the road and battle losses   not to mention tropical diseases and venomous snakes   had taken their toll on his troops. Faced with the prospect of crossing a threemile- wide torrent, only to face more of the same tribulations on the other side, Alexander s army refused. The great adventure was over. The return journey from the subcontinent was not pretty. The weary Greeks saw their numbers depleted first by flash floods and then, cruelly, a horrendous drought. As for their leader, his once razor-sharp mind became increasingly erratic. He drank more: 24-hour binges became a familiar part of his routine   followed, of course, by a couple of days of hangover. Unsurprisingly, plots against him began to simmer. In autumn 324 BC, Alexander s closest companion (and, some claim, lover) Hephaestion died   possibly of typhus fever or typhoid exacerbated by heavy alcohol consumption. Devastated, Alexander declined rapidly. He reached Babylon in spring 323 BC, and in June took to his sick bed. His condition worsened and within days he was dead, aged just 32. Was it a fever that killed him, or had his liver simply given up? Perhaps he was poisoned? He was, after all, not short of enemies. Alexander the Great never made it home to Macedon. But then he never intended to. As the greatest military leader in ancient history, he left a monumental legacy: his vast Asian empire. Alexander the Great: personality and godliness Historian Paul Cartledge looks into the personality of the 4th-century BC military genius to discover what drove him to create a huge empire covering three continents... Alexander the Great had no low opinion of himself. That s not surprising given that the 4th-century BC ruler had conquered most of the known world before he had even reached the age of 30. Nevertheless, he appears to have been aware of the value of self-promotion, so besides his armies of soldiers he employed a small army of writers and artists to project the image of himself that he wanted to disseminate to the world at large. Hardly anything of those original writings survives today, unfortunately   though we do have the works of ancient Greek and Roman historians and biographers such as Curtius Rufus, Arrian and Plutarch who themselves had access to the lost texts by Ptolemy, Aristoboulus, Nearchus and others. On the other hand, large numbers of portrait coins and medallions and sculptures do survive intact, some contemporary or near-contemporary, so that we have a very good idea of the impression Alexander wished to create for his many hundreds of thousands of subjects scattered from what is today Greece (including Macedonia) in the west, as far east as what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan. One thing is very striking about all these various images. They all aim to elevate Alexander not only above the common herd of ordinary men, but above the status of the merely mortal altogether: to the status of a semi divine hero or even a god. Scholars argue as to whether Alexander sent down a formal decree from Babylon (in Iraq), one of his several capitals, actually ordering his subjects to worship him as a god. But there is no question but that he was indeed worshipped as a living god, by Greeks as well as by Orientals, and there is every likelihood that Alexander wanted to be so worshipped. This was not unprecedented, because Alexander s father Philip had already been granted divine worship as a living god. And anything Philip could do, Alexander could do better; it s arguable that rivalry with his father was one of the biggest psychological motivating forces in all Alexander s major projects, and one of the most powerful influences on his personality. Who influenced Alexander the Great? Philip II was, according to one contemporary historian, the most remarkable man Europe had produced. He raised his kingdom of Macedon from a small player on the Greek scene to the major protagonist and arbiter of the Greek world. A man of violent temper and ferocious ambition, Philip fell out with Alexander s mother Olympias (a Greek princess) quite early on. Alexander perhaps therefore became something of a mummy s boy   not in the sense that he was ever a timid, coddled wimp, but in the sense that his powerfully ambitious mother saw Alexander as a key weapon in her struggle with Philip, and the instrument whereby she could become not just another of Philip s seven wives, but queen mother, mother of the heir apparent and eventually mother of the Macedonian king. Alexander, who admired Philip but also envied his achievements, was probably happy to go along with her   perhaps even to the extent of conniving with her at Philip s public assassination at Aegae in 336. However, Alexander did once quip that the highly-strung Olympias made him pay a high rent for the nine months she had housed him in her womb. Apart from his parents, there were two great influences on his life from boyhood. One was the great Thessalian stallion Bucephalas, whom Alexander himself tamed and from whom he was pretty much inseparable from at least his early teens until the death of the great horse, aged about 30, in Pakistan in 326. So moved was Alexander by his loss that he actually named one of his new city foundations after him, in the Indus valley. The other was Alexander s boyhood comrade Hephaestion. He came from an elite Macedonian family, and was among the close group of comrades who had the privilege of being taught with Alexander by the philosopher Aristotle at Mieza, to the west of the Macedonian capital of Pella. Hephaestion was a bit older, and a bit taller, than Alexander, and it is probable that at some stage their relationship was more than platonic.

(Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) Yet for Alexander sexual gratification was apparently not that important.  Sex and sleep  he is said to have remarked,  are the only two things that remind me I m mortal . Or, as his best surviving historian Arrian (a Greek from Asia Minor writing in the second century AD) put it, warfare and military exploits gave Alexander the sort of thrill that others derived from sexual conquest. Not that Alexander was a monk; he is said to have had sex even with a mythical Amazon queen, and to have fathered a child with his beautiful Sogdian bride Roxane (from what is today Uzbekistan). He allegedly had affairs with the Persian wife of a dangerous Greek opponent fighting on the Persian side, and a liaison with a Persian eunuch. What s striking is that his preferred sexual partners were mainly Oriental rather than Greek or Macedonian. Philip is said to have fought his wars by marriages, that is by concluding diplomatic marriage alliances as a way to secure a victory, or as an alternative to fighting in order to decide the issue of territorial control. Alexander preferred to settle disputes by fighting, on the whole. However, even he took three wives, the other two besides Roxane both being Persian princesses. Alexander the Great away from the battlefield When Alexander was not fighting, there was nothing he loved to do more, for relaxation, than hunt. Big game hunting, that is   wild boar and lions; not child s play quarries like hares or doves. In Macedon there were two tests of manhood: killing a wild boar and killing a man in battle. Alexander had passed both of those by the time he was sixteen, besides hunting the wild mountain lions and sharp-eyed lynxes that still abounded in the western Macedonian upland country. Bucephalas served Alexander no less faithfully as his hunting mount than as his number one warhorse. When the going got tough on campaign (as it did in Iran, Afghanistan and central Asia after he had defeated Great King Darius III of Persia and taken his crown) a reward for any success was a day s hunting in a game park. In one of these hunting sprees near modern Samarkand, no fewer than 4,000 animals were allegedly slaughtered. It is the same dedicated hunter s mentality that made Alexander ruthless in pursuit of all his goals. Historians have argued since antiquity over what might have been Alexander s ultimate goal, had he not died prematurely (and probably of a malarial or typhoid fever rather than by an assassin s poison-bearing hand) at Babylon in 323 aged just 32. One theory takes us back to our starting point, to his self-projection as more than merely mortal. Certainly, he was religious, even superstitious, a trait he seems to have inherited or at any rate could easily have learned from his mother. How did Alexander the Great die? Aslo, where is Alexander the Great buried, and has his tomb actually been found? Professor Paul Cartledge gives his view... He relied especially heavily on the guidance of his personal diviner, Aristander, a Greek from Telmissus in what is now southwestern Turkey. Aristander s interpretation of portents such as the behaviour of birds could mean life or death for Alexander s supposed friends no less than his sworn enemies. Consultation of oracular shrines was a fixed part of Alexander s routine. Apollo s seat at Delphi in central Greece was hardly out of his way in 336, and the priestess there was made to prophesy that he would be invincible. But the trip to the oasis of Siwa in Egypt s western desert in 332, a dangerous journey over several hundred waterless and dust ridden kilometres, was a different proposition. Alexander gravely announced that the oracle s presiding deity Ammon, whom the Greeks often identified with their Zeus, had promised him his heart s desire. But what that was has to be inferred from his subsequent behaviour. It was something to do with the truth about his origins; the oracle seems to have confirmed Alexander in his belief that he had been born the son of a god, rather than a mortal. Not all his closest companions were as enamoured as he was of the notion that Philip was just Alexander s  so-called father . Nor did they all follow Hephaestion s lead in paying to Alexander the kind of public adoration that they thought was appropriate only for a true Olympian divinity. Persians too had not been in the habit of recognising their Great King as a living god but had seen him rather as the vicar on earth of the great god of light Ahura Mazda. Some of Alexander s Oriental subjects, on the other hand, such as the Egyptians, would have thought less of him as their king if he had not been the recipient of divine worship. So, as well as being one of the major drivers of his personality, Alexander s intimations of godhead could easily have been one of the major causes of dissension at the heart of his mixed Greek-Oriental court. Posterity has generally been more kind to Alexander, variously venerating or indeed worshipping him as a saint as well as a wonder-working holy man and military hero. Within the sphere of recent critical scholarship, however, a distinct note of hostility can be detected, influenced perhaps by contemporary experience of bloodshed in regions such as Afghanistan and Iraq that Alexander himself once traversed. Those scholars who see Alexander as little but a natural-born killer might bear in mind the words of the American poet Robert Lowell, in his poem The Death of Alexander: \"No one was like him. Terrible were his crimes   but if you wish to blackguard the Great King, think how mean, obscure, and dull you are, your labors lowly and your merits less...\" 6 things you (probably) didn t know about Alexander the Great Author Jennifer Macaire shares six surprising facts about the Macedonian conqueror... Alexander played polo Legend has it that when Alexander the Great was about to invade Persia in 334 BC, the Persian king Darius III sent him a polo mallet and ball. It s thought that this gesture was either inviting the Macedonian to a game, or he was suggesting that Alexander should  stick to games and avoid war . Whatever the intention, Alexander is said to have replied:  I am the stick and the ball is the Earth    before going on to conquer Persia. Polo, one of the oldest sports in the world, likely originated somewhere in Central Asia. Mounted nomads played a version of polo that was part sport, part training for war, with as many as 100 men on a side. If its origins are obscure, there is ample evidence of the game s regal place in the history of Asia: the game followed the nomads  migration to Persia sometime between 600 BC and 100 AD and the Persians adopted polo as their national sport, where it was played by nobles and soldiers alike. Some stories say Alexander the Great spent time with the Persian royal family when he was young, accompanying his father on diplomatic missions. Alexander most likely saw polo games on his many forays into Persia, and perhaps even played the  sport of kings . He may have gone underwater in a diving bell A 14th-century illustration showing Alexander the Great in a diving bell lowered from a small boat. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Almost immediately after his death in 323 BC, legends began to spread about Alexander the Great s exploits and life which, over the centuries, became increasingly fantastic as well as allegorical. Collectively, this tradition is called the Alexander Romance and the stories feature such episodes as Alexander ascending through the air to paradise; journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble; and voyaging through the  Land of Darkness  in search of the  Fountain of Youth . Writing attributed to the Greek philosopher Aristotle references a diving bell, describing a cauldron forced straight down into water, thus keeping the air within it. In fact, it s possible that Alexander the Great saw, or was perhaps even in, a glass diving bell. There are stories about him visiting the bottom of the ocean in a glass ball during his famous siege of Tyre (Lebanon), where it is said Alexander used divers to remove underwater obstacles from the harbour, and that the divers used crude glass diving bells. These may very well be just legends, but it is conceivable that Alexander, who was curious to learn about everything, had a go in a glass diving bell himself. We almost certainly know what he looked like The Azara herm is a Roman copy of a bust of Alexander the Great that was almost certainly made by the Greek sculptor Lysippus. According to the Greek writer Plutarch, Alexander made Lysippus his  official  portrait artist during his reign. Thanks to its original inscription, this figure can be definitely identified as Alexander the Great, son of Philip II of Macedon. The Azara herm, a Roman copy of a bust of Alexander the Great, thought to be by the Greek sculptor Lysippus. (Photo by: PHAS/UIG via Getty Images) Since the Azara herm is a Roman copy made centuries after Alexander s death, it is likely not as precise as the original. The bust was unearthed in 1779 during an excavation at Tivoli, Italy, organised by Joseph Nicolas Azara (1730 1804), the Spanish ambassador to the Holy See (and, later, to France). Azara presented the sculpture to Napoleon Bonaparteas a diplomatic gift. Today it resides in the Louvre museum in Paris. For a time, this was the only known portrait of Alexander the Great, and it is generally regarded as the surviving portrait that looks the most like him. Much of Plutarch's famous writings about Alexander the Great can be considered fiction The Greek writer Plutarch wrote Parallel Lives, his series of biographies of famous Greeks and Romans, in pairs: his famous biography of Alexander is paired with Julius Caesar. However, Plutarch s reliability as a biographer is questionable. He lived 400 years after Alexander the Great and contemporary writings were scarce. Plutarch was also Greek and the Greeks saw Alexander as an  upstart barbarian : firstly, because of historic snobbery (anyone non-Greek was considered a  barbarian ); and secondly, because the Greeks still resented the Macedonians who, under Alexander s father, had conquered Greece through battles and diplomacy. Plutarch begins his biography by saying he s not writing  history , but rather  a life story , because, he goes on to explain, it s better to get to know a person from his character and his jokes than from endless battles fought and won. He pretends to glorify Alexander beyond reason, writing:  On his father s side, he was descended from Hercules . However, since Alexander himself had claimed the title of  son of Zeus , Plutarch was definitely trying to take him down a peg. Nevertheless, Plutarch s biography does include some fascinating titbits of information, such as his claim that the battle of Gaugamela (the decisive battle Alexander the Great fought against Persia in 331 BC) was fought during an eclipse. He also describes how Alexander the Great spent the night before the battle in his tent with his diviner, Aristander, performing certain mysterious ceremonies and sacrificing to the god Fear. Alexander's the Great's favourite military tactic was the phalanx A relief depicting a Macedonian phalanx, Thessaloniki, Greece. (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images) The phalanx   a rectangular mass military formation made up of closely ranked troops   was a formidable fighting machine. The spears used by soldiers in a phalanx were long   sometimes as long as five metres   and made of sharpened wood or metal-tipped wood. The tactic was perfected by Alexander s father, Philip, who first learned of it after observing Greek armies. According to the Greek historian Arrian s Anabasis written in the second century AD:  Alexander drew up his army in such a way that the depth of the phalanx was 120 men; and [ ] he ordered them to preserve silence, in order to receive the word of command quickly.  Macedonian author Polyaenus (in Stratagemata, also in the second century AD) says that Alexander spitefully made his men who had not fought bravely enough in battle wear the so-called hemithorakion   a half armour system that only covered the front part of the body. This punitive experiment made sure that the soldiers wouldn t turn their backs on the enemy. However, in reality the soldiers in a phalanx would actually not require much armour   coordinated, fast movement was what made the phalanx so effective. Polyaenus describes the Macedonian infantrymen of the phalanx as being armed with helmets (kranos); light shields (pelte); greaves (knemides) and a long pike (sarissa)   notice that armour is conspicuously missing from this list. But while Alexander the Great led one of the most successful armies of all time, surprisingly little is understood about the main type of body armour that both he and many of his men wore   the linothorax   as there are no surviving examples. The linothorax was a type of body armour created by laminating together layers of linen. It wrapped around the torso and tied over the shoulder with two flaps. The most famous image of this kind of body armour is the Alexander Mosaic: a celebrated ancient mosaic which was found in the largest house in Pompeii   the House of the Faun   and depicts Alexander the Great s defeat of the Persian king Darius. Alexander the Great at the battle of Issus. He can be seen on the left of the mosaic from the House of Faun, with his opponent, Pesian king Darius III, on the right (Photo by: Werner Forman/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) When his friend Hephaestion, Alexander held a hugely expensive funeral Hephaestion was a member of Alexander s personal bodyguard and a general in his army. He was also Alexander s best friend, right-hand man, and some say his lover as well. When he died suddenly in Ecbatana from unknown causes, Alexander wrote to the Oracle at Siwa in Egypt and asked if Hephaestion should be honoured as a god or a hero. The Oracle replied that he should be honoured as a hero, and so Alexander went all out for a mausoleum/funeral pyre designed to impress. The Library of History, compiled by Diodorus Siculus, includes several accounts of the funeral pyre, of which there were seven levels   each level more lavishly decorated than the last. Perched upon the bottom layer of 240 golden prows of ships and held up by palm tree trunks, Siculus says, there were:  Torches fifteen cubits high with golden wreaths about their handles. At their flaming ends perched eagles with outspread wings looking downward, while about their bases were serpents looking up at the eagles, [ ] a multitude of wild animals being pursued by hunters, [ ] a centauromachy rendered in gold, while the fifth [level] showed lions and bulls alternating, also in gold. The next higher level was covered with Macedonian and Persian arms, testifying to the prowess of the one people and to the defeats of the other. On top of all stood Sirens, hollowed out and able to conceal within them persons who sang a lament in mourning for the dead. The total height of the pyre was more than one hundred and thirty cubits.  A cubit is an ancient measurement of length based on the distance from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger, so it varies. But the pyre, as described here, could have been more than 50 metres high. Alexander the Great plundered the treasuries of all his cities to pay for the monument   it has been estimated to have cost the modern equivalent of two billion dollars. Alexander the Great had made his seat of government in Babylon, the capital of Babylonia (the alluvial plain between the Euphrates and Tigris), and he wanted to hold the funeral ceremony within the walls of the city. However, the monument was so huge that Alexander had to break down one of the city s walls to get it inside. He then set the monument on fire, cremating the general s body along with the magnificent pyre. What is Alexander the Great's legacy? Spencer Day examines how Alexander left his mark on the lands he conquered... According to Plutarch, Alexander the Great founded 70 towns and cities, including at least 16 that he modestly named Alexandria. For centuries, historians and military strategists alike have extolled Alexander s genius as a soldier, and rightly so. But, for all that, perhaps his greatest impact on human history derives not from his brilliance as a commander but as a supreme cultural ambassador. Alexander didn t simply wipe cities from the face of the Earth, before moving on to the next target   not all the time anyway. Instead, he left colonies of fellow Macedonians to administer conquered population centres, and they went about disseminating Greek methods of expression and thinking. As a result, peoples from modern-day Turkey through Asia Minor all the way to India played Greek sports, watched Greek theatre, mimicked Greek art and adopted Greek scientific practices. In many cases, they continued to do so for centuries. The cities of Ai Khanum in what is now Afghanistan and Philoteris in Egypt may have been separated by some 3,000 miles but they both boasted Greek gymnasiums. Ai Khanum was also home to an Acropolis, a theatre and library   a direct consequence of Alexander s extraordinary conquests. Alexander s incursion into India was brief and bloody, but its impact on the subcontinent s culture was significant. It inspired the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha in Indian sculpture and the appearance of Greek mythological figures, including Herakles, in Buddhist literature. It may even lie behind Indian astrologers  adoption of the signs of the zodiac. It seems that Alexander s cultural impact may even have spread beyond the borders of his massive empire, perhaps seeping into China. The theorem of Pythagoras reached the Chinese within decades of Alexander s death, and it s thought that the Terracotta Army may have been influenced by Greek models. But perhaps Alexander s most enduring cultural legacy was the fact that, for a thousand years, Greek became the  lingua franca  of the near east. As a result, when the Christian New Testament was first recorded, it was written down in Greek, the very language that Alexander had himself spoken hundreds of years earlier.

Born in the late seventh century BC, Solon was chosen to become a governor or archon of Athens. Through his economic reforms, he freed those who had been forced into debt-slavery for not being able to pay their creditors, and encouraged people to take up trades to avoid poverty. Thanks to Solon, all Athenian male citizens could also attend the general assembly for the first time, and rule was taken from being solely in the hands of the city-state's aristocratic families. Many of the lawmaker s reforms failed initially, as Athens was temporarily ruled by the tyrant Peisistratos a few years after Solon left the city. His efforts, however, would lay the foundations for the reforms brought in by Cleisthenes a few decades later, which formally established democracy in Athens. Hippocrates, c460 c375 BC Unusually for the ancient world, physician and philosopher Hippocrates believed that illnesses had rational rather than supernatural explanations. At the time, the gods and magical curses were often blamed for causing disease. Instead, Hippocrates  pupils were encouraged to observe their patients, note their symptoms, and analyse how their illnesses progressed. He established medicine as a formal profession, and the Hippocratic Oath   a code of conduct for doctors   still inspires the one taken by physicians around the world today. He was also a believer in exercising and eating a healthy diet as a way of preventing and treating disease. The work of Hippocrates later inspired the physician Galen (AD 129  c210), and the ideas of both men were treated as fact until the late medieval period. Read more about the history of medicine Sophocles, c496 406 BC As much as we love a laugh when we go to the theatre, there's something about a tragic story that appeals and pulls at the heartstrings, and we have the Athenians to thank for the genre of tragedy. Watching a play in ancient Greece was a favourite pastime, and festivals held to honour the god Dionysus saw three dramatic genres emerge: tragedy, comedy and satyr drama (the latter combining both). The works of Sophocles are some of the earliest-surviving tragic plays, and include Oedipus Rex and Antigone. Born just outside Athens in the early fifth century BC, Sophocles  talents first came to prominence when he won first prize for tragedy in the Dionysian festival, beating the Athenian king of drama, Aeschylus. As well as his work as a dramatist, Sophocles worked as a treasurer, diplomat and general, and is thought to have written more than 120 plays, though only seven complete works survive. He also did much to revolutionise drama, with perhaps his most important innovation being the addition of a third actor to a play. Previously two actors would play several roles, but with the addition of one more, more characters could be written, and the plot could become more varied and exciting. Sappho, c630 570 BC Thought to have been born in the late seventh century BC on the island of Lesbos, poet Sappho was from an aristocratic family. On Lesbos, she ran an academy for young unmarried women devoted to Eros and Aphrodite   the god and goddess of love. Sappho was considered one of the greatest lyric poets of her day and mainly wrote on the themes of love, family and friendship. While some say she died of old age, other stories claim that she threw herself off a cliff after having her heart broken. Three centuries after her death, Sappho became the source of parody and was characterised as a promiscuous homosexual   the term  lesbian  is derived from the island where she was born and  sapphic  refers to love between women, as well as the four-line form that Sappho s poetry usually took. There is little concrete evidence about her true sexuality, though, and she wrote as passionately about men as she did women.

Before pursuing philosophy, Socrates fought in the Peloponnesian War and worked as a stonemason. His philosophical ideas were extremely radical for the time   he believed that people should focus on their behaviour and morality rather than wealth and power. Although he attracted many scholars to his discussions, Socrates wasn t widely liked in Athens and was an outspoken opponent of democracy. In 399 BC, he was sentenced to death after being charged with corrupting the city s youth and disrespecting the gods. \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] Socrates wasn't widely liked in ancient Athens.

We have little concrete knowledge about his life, though it s thought he was born in Samos in the early-sixth century BC. After travelling, Pythagoras settled in Italy where he formed a secret group of students who lived by a philosophy based around mathematics   appropriately known as the Pythagoreans. He is credited with discovering the functional significance of numbers, as well as the Pythagoras theorem, used to calculate the length of the sides in a right-angled triangle. Pericles, c495 429 BC General and statesmen Pericles oversaw Athens during its golden age and was so well respected that he was lauded as the city s  first citizen . He led Athens during the first few years of the Peloponnesian War and expanded the Delian League   a group of Greek states   into an empire. A lover of the arts and literature, his ambitious building programme, which included the Acropolis, helped Athens become the cultural and educational centre of the ancient world. He succumbed to the Plague of Athens in 429 BC. Herodotus, c484 c425 BC Without Herodotus, we might not know as much as we do about the events of ancient Greece. He's believed to have hailed from Halicarnassus, a Greek city that was under Persian rule at his birth in the early fifth century. In around 425 BC, he published The Histories   an account of the Greco-Persian Wars. This was the first time that a writer had attempted to explain the cause of an event, or study it in such detail   and so historical analysis was born. Herodotus' work was based on his travels across the Persian and Greek territories and the stories he collected on the way. What we know about the battle of Marathon is all thanks to Herodotus. Other writers criticised his weaving of fiction into his narratives, but he is widely considered the first true historian. Alexander the Great, 356 323 BC Despite his short rule, Alexander the Great transformed the ancient world in just over a decade. In 336 BC, after the assassination of his father, Alexander ascended the Macedonian throne at the age of 20; educated by the great philosopher Aristotle, he was an adept leader and strategist. Under his rule, Macedonia continued asserting its power within Greece. Even more impressively, Alexander conquered territories that were formerly part of the Persian empire without losing a single major battle, including Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt. At 25, he was leader of Greece, pharaoh of Egypt and overlord of Asia Minor, and for the next decade he consolidated his sprawling empire, which spanned three continents. His death at the age of 32 saw his empire broken up, and many historians have since questioned how much more he could have achieved had he lived longer. Today he is still considered one of history s greatest military commanders. Archimedes, c287 212 BC If you ve ever had a brilliant idea and shouted  Eureka! , you have Greek scientist and inventor Archimedes to thank for that. According to an anecdotal story, Archimedes allegedly discovered that the amount of water displaced when he entered his bathtub was equal to the amount of upward force put on the body. He was so delighted that he apparently ran down the street naked, shouting  Eureka!    Greek for  I have found it! . Whether or not the story is true, Archimedes, who hailed from Syracuse in Sicily, is one of ancient Greece s most famous scientists, inventors and mathematicians. He discovered the law of hydrostatics, the principles of the lever and created siege engines. It s thought that Archimedes' inventions even included machines that could lift ships out of the water, and found an accurate approximation of pi   the ratio of the circumference of any circle to the diameter of that circle. Despite this, Archimedes  mathematical writings were little known in his own time   it wasn t until the sixth century AD that they gained a wide readership.

The use of this term goes all the way back to a poem written during the early days of the ancient Greeks. Few concrete facts are known about the life of Homer, but legends claim he was a blind bard from the island of Chios and that his poems would have been spread orally before being written down. His work is presumed to include the Iliad   one of the most important sources about the legendary Trojan War   and the Odyssey   an account of the epic journey taken by Odysseus after the fall of Troy. The works were the foundation of ancient Greek literature and are still considered some of the most important in the western canon. There is some debate over exactly who wrote the poems attributed to Homer, but experts agree they were written around the late eighth to early seventh century BC. Whether Homer did write them or not, the epics shaped Greek culture, highlighted popular values of the time (such as honour and courage), and remain some of the oldest surviving works of literature still widely read today. Homer s epic Iliad depicts the bitter 10-year siege of Troy by a coalition of Greeks.

Aristotle founded a school of philosophy at the Lyceum in Athens and was considered influential enough to be the teacher of the young Alexander the Great. Aristotle s writings were some of the first to create a system of western philosophy that included logic, science, morality, politics and metaphysics. He heavily influenced Christian theology, as well as medieval Islamic and Jewish traditions, and his work is still studied and analysed today. Pheidias, c480 430 BC Pheidias was one of the most famous artists of the ancient world whose greatest works have unfortunately not stood the test of time. Little of his life is known, but he worked mainly in Athens before creating a workshop at Olympia. Here, he created his greatest masterpiece   a gold and ivory seated statue of Zeus that became one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. He also created three monuments to Athena, as well the Parthenon carvings   these survive today, and those in the British Museum are known as the Elgin Marbles. Pheidias  later years took a dramatic turn when he was thrown in prison after being accused of embezzling gold intended for a statue of Athena; it s thought he died while incarcerated. Anyte of Tegea, c3rd century BC Anyte was so celebrated as a poet in the third century BC that she was widely known as the female Homer. Born in Arcadia in the Peloponnese, she stood out from the crowd as one of the first poets to focus on the natural world rather than the gods or the supernatural. Ancient Greek poets were often commissioned to write epitaphs and epigrams to celebrate battle victories and heroes, but Anyte instead memorialised loved ones and favourite pets. More of her work survives than any other ancient Greek female writer, except for Sappho.

Born in the late seventh century BC, Solon was chosen to become a governor or archon of Athens. Through his economic reforms, he freed those who had been forced into debt-slavery for not being able to pay their creditors, and encouraged people to take up trades to avoid poverty. Thanks to Solon, all Athenian male citizens could also attend the general assembly for the first time, and rule was taken from being solely in the hands of the city-state's aristocratic families. Many of the lawmaker s reforms failed initially, as Athens was temporarily ruled by the tyrant Peisistratos a few years after Solon left the city. His efforts, however, would lay the foundations for the reforms brought in by Cleisthenes a few decades later, which formally established democracy in Athens. Hippocrates, c460 c375 BC Unusually for the ancient world, physician and philosopher Hippocrates believed that illnesses had rational rather than supernatural explanations. At the time, the gods and magical curses were often blamed for causing disease. Instead, Hippocrates  pupils were encouraged to observe their patients, note their symptoms, and analyse how their illnesses progressed. He established medicine as a formal profession, and the Hippocratic Oath   a code of conduct for doctors   still inspires the one taken by physicians around the world today. He was also a believer in exercising and eating a healthy diet as a way of preventing and treating disease. The work of Hippocrates later inspired the physician Galen (AD 129  c210), and the ideas of both men were treated as fact until the late medieval period. Read more about the history of medicine Sophocles, c496 406 BC As much as we love a laugh when we go to the theatre, there's something about a tragic story that appeals and pulls at the heartstrings, and we have the Athenians to thank for the genre of tragedy. Watching a play in ancient Greece was a favourite pastime, and festivals held to honour the god Dionysus saw three dramatic genres emerge: tragedy, comedy and satyr drama (the latter combining both). The works of Sophocles are some of the earliest-surviving tragic plays, and include Oedipus Rex and Antigone. Born just outside Athens in the early fifth century BC, Sophocles  talents first came to prominence when he won first prize for tragedy in the Dionysian festival, beating the Athenian king of drama, Aeschylus. As well as his work as a dramatist, Sophocles worked as a treasurer, diplomat and general, and is thought to have written more than 120 plays, though only seven complete works survive. He also did much to revolutionise drama, with perhaps his most important innovation being the addition of a third actor to a play. Previously two actors would play several roles, but with the addition of one more, more characters could be written, and the plot could become more varied and exciting. Sappho, c630 570 BC Thought to have been born in the late seventh century BC on the island of Lesbos, poet Sappho was from an aristocratic family. On Lesbos, she ran an academy for young unmarried women devoted to Eros and Aphrodite   the god and goddess of love. Sappho was considered one of the greatest lyric poets of her day and mainly wrote on the themes of love, family and friendship. While some say she died of old age, other stories claim that she threw herself off a cliff after having her heart broken. Three centuries after her death, Sappho became the source of parody and was characterised as a promiscuous homosexual   the term  lesbian  is derived from the island where she was born and  sapphic  refers to love between women, as well as the four-line form that Sappho s poetry usually took. There is little concrete evidence about her true sexuality, though, and she wrote as passionately about men as she did women.

Before pursuing philosophy, Socrates fought in the Peloponnesian War and worked as a stonemason. His philosophical ideas were extremely radical for the time   he believed that people should focus on their behaviour and morality rather than wealth and power. Although he attracted many scholars to his discussions, Socrates wasn t widely liked in Athens and was an outspoken opponent of democracy. In 399 BC, he was sentenced to death after being charged with corrupting the city s youth and disrespecting the gods. \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] \" alt=\"A stone bust of Socrates\" classes=\"\"] Socrates wasn't widely liked in ancient Athens.

        "title": "Why did Hitler choose the swastika as a Nazi symbol?",
        "content": "The swastika is today synonymous with Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime; a red and black symbol of the Second World War. But this hasn't always been the case   the swastika existed as a symbol long before it was adopted by the Nazis, and the symbol's story is longer and more complex than you might expect. Ad So how and why did the Nazis use the swastika, and what is the ancient origin of the symbol made infamous by Hitler? Why did Hitler choose the swastika? When Adolf Hitler began his rise to power and looked for a symbol to encapsulate his movement, the Nazi Party and a strong future for Germany, the swastika became the clear choice. German antiquarian Heinrich Schliemann had grown obsessed with finding Troy, the lost city of Greek mythology, and in 1868 he set out with his copy of The Iliad to search the Mediterranean. Schliemann's search led him to the mysterious mound of Hisarlik on the Aegean coast of Turkey. There, during the 1870s, Schliemann unearthed layers of civilisations dating back thousands of years, and declared the oldest to be Troy. The city of legend had been found   although it turned out to be a different layer than the one Schliemann thought   as well as a cache of jewellery, bronze, silver and gold. Yet in the ancient ruins he made another fateful discovery: some 1,800 depictions of a symbol that resembled a cross with bent arms: the swastika. News of Schliemann s sensational excavations spread far and wide, quickly followed by the swastika, which became a ubiquitous sign, visible throughout Europe and North America. At the same time, however, the swastika s long history saw it become a favourite of German nationalists, who subscribed to a warped theory that they had descended from an ancient  master race  known as the Aryans. This belief persisted into the 20th century, growing more pernicious until it appealed to Adolf Hitler, the leader of the burgeoning Nazi Party. Hitler understood the power of an image and knew it would give the Nazi ideals an historic foundation. He could not adequately reconcile his view of Germany s Christian history with the religion s historical Jewish connections   essentially, that Christ was himself Jewish   so the idea that Germans descended from a white master race with a tried and tested symbol had great appeal. And so the swastika, or hakenkreuz (hooked cross), became the emblem of the Nazi Party in 1920; Hitler himself took personal credit for designing the flag. It used the red, white and black of the old German imperial flag   a cunning move to link Germany's past with its future   but attributed new meanings to them. \"In red we see the social idea of the movement, in white the nationalistic idea, in the swastika the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man,\" wrote Hitler in his 1925 autobiographical manifesto, Mein Kampf. The new design became the national flag on 15 September 1935 during the mass annual rally at Nuremberg. On the same day, two race laws were passed prohibiting marriages between Germans and Jews and declaring that only those of German blood could be citizens of the Reich. And so the act of cultural, religious and social theft that was the appropriation of the swastika was complete. It ensured that the Nazi flag would be associated with evil   under which a brutal war raged, atrocities committed and some six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. What is the swastika? A cross with arms bent at right angles meant many things to many people, but had always been used as a sign of hope and positivity. It could represent good fortune or prosperity; symbolise the Sun or the infinity of creation; or, as it still does in several religions, evoke a sense of the divine and call for auspiciousness. The word swastika itself derives from the Sanskrit svastika, meaning \"conducive to well-being\". What is the history of the swastika? The oldest-known example of the swastika dates back some 15,000 years. Discovered in Ukraine in 1908, an ivory mammoth tusk carved into the shape of a bird includes an intricate pattern of connected swastikas on its body, which may have been used as a fertility symbol. There is no knowing how the design first came about. It may have simply been an elegant, easy-to-create geometric shape, although its inspiration possibly came from a comet in the night sky. It was also in Eastern Europe that single swastikas were carved by the Vinca culture during the Neolithic period, some 7,000 years ago, before they became widespread from the Bronze Age. The swastika symbolised the Sun to the Illyrians; became a common sight on Mesopotamian coins; appeared on vases and clothing in Greece; formed mosaic motifs in Rome, and stands in as a stylised cross in Celtic design. There are 27 swastikas on the Iron Age Battersea Shield, found in London in 1857, but the symbol had been in Britain long before that as the so-called Swastika Stone on Ilkley Moor, Yorkshire, from c2,000 BC, shows. This carving resembles the swastika s shape, although with more curved arms and added spots. Swastikas could be found in Roman mosaics, as evidenced in this one excavated at Lullingtone Roman Villa in Eynsford, Kent (Photo by English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images) The swastika, often known as a gammadion or fylflot, continued to be used throughout Europe, occasionally being subsumed into religious iconography. Early Christian art depicts the hooked cross to represent Christ's victory over death, while a left-facing version of the swastika showed up in reference to the Norse god Thor's hammer. Still a popular symbol in medieval times, the swastika can be seen today on surviving church decorations, coats of arms and on textile fragments from the 12th century thought to be from a dress owned by a Slav princess. The monastery school a young Adolf Hitler attended, Lambach Abbey in Austria, had swastikas carved on the stone and woodwork. Yet the influence of the swastika reached much further than can be explained by the migration of peoples over the centuries. It has appeared in several cultures across northern Africa, including as window decorations in churches in modern-day Ethiopia, while also showing up in the Mayan, Aztec and Kuna civilisations of South and Central America. A number of Native American and First Nation tribes of North America, such as the Navajo, Hopi and Passamaquoddy, also adopted the symbol, which they called  whirling logs . Swastikas are prevalent and potent symbols in several religions: there s a small one on the chest of this Buddha in Hong Kong s Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery (Photo by Victor Fraile/Corbis via Getty Images) Undoubtedly the most enduring relationship with the swastika began in Asia, especially in India, among followers of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, for whom it has served as a holy symbol for millennia. To Jains, the swastika represents one of the 24 Tirthankara, or saviours, while Buddhists regard the symbol as the footprints of the Buddha. For Hindus, the right-hand svastika   a term that emerged c500 BC   is a sign of surya (the Sun) and auspiciousness, so is used to mark entrances, offerings, ceremonies, festivals and each year's account books. The left-hand version, the sauvastika, is symbolic of the night and the goddess Kali. The swastika remains as spiritually significant today, in the face of the stigma towards the symbol in the West brought on by the Nazis. How did the swastika become a Nazi symbol? Heinrich Schliemann's discovery of Troy in the 1870s set in motion the events that transformed the swastika, a symbol of fortune and hope for thousands of years, into a hated and feared sign of fascism. He concluded it to be a \"significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors\" when he unearthed 1,800 examples, but his colleague, Emile-Louis Burnouf, thought differently. Knowing the symbol appeared in India, Burnouf studied a sacred Hindu text called the Rigveda and claimed to have found a connection between the swastika and an enigmatic ancient people, the Aryans. Burnouf studied a sacred Hindu text called the Rigveda and claimed to have found a connection between the swastika and an enigmatic ancient people, the Aryans Supposedly, this 'master race' of white-skinned warriors constituted the peak of human civilisation, conquering lands such as India and bringing the swastika with them. The word Aryan itself derived from Sanskrit, like svastika. Pots from the sixth-century had been found in Germany with swastikas on them and scholars noted the similarities between Sanskrit and German as further proof that the Aryans had come from Germany. But the whole notion of this 'pure' race, as well as being deeply racist, was based on a misunderstanding. The Sanskrit word for Aryan ( rya) actually meant \"honourable, respectable or noble\" and referred to a social or linguistic distinction, not a separate ethnic group. Before the Nazis, the swastika was widely adopted in the West as a symbol of luck and fortune (Photo by Rykoff Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) But the theory of the Aryans  existence grew in popularity from the mid-19th century. The unification of Germany in 1871, the same year Schliemann started work at Troy, led to a swell of uninhibited nationalism in the country and the idea that Germans descended from Aryans. To them, the discovery at Troy of their symbol, the swastika, proved they had been a dominant race. So while the swastika existed as a benign good-luck charm across Europe and North America, it simultaneously became an icon for German nationalists and anti-Semitic groups. What is the swastika a symbol of today? In the aftermath of World War II, publicly displaying the swastika was banned in Germany, where it remains illegal. Yet while reviled in the Western world, it continues to be a potent symbol with far-right and white-supremacist groups. In the US, where its use is permitted, incidents involving swastika flags and graffiti have increased in recent years, most infamously when neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. It can be seen seemingly everywhere in parts of the Indian subcontinent   from temple entrances to the front of taxis   and plays an important role in ceremonies and festivals But the swastika also remains a feature of worship for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. It can be seen seemingly everywhere in parts of the Indian subcontinent   from temple entrances to the front of taxis   and plays an important role in ceremonies and festivals. During Diwali   the Hindu festival of lights   the swastika is drawn with coloured sand, or rangoli, and depicted with lanterns to celebrate the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. In 2007, when German politicians attempted to introduce a swastika ban across the European Union, Hindus vehemently opposed the measure on religious grounds. Swastikas are drawn in coloured sand during Diwali celebrations (Photo by Shashi Sharma/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) Such disparate attitudes towards the swastika raises the question of whether the symbol   which for so long has been a force for good   can be reclaimed from its association with Hitler and the neo-Nazis who still display it. Would reclaiming the symbol mark the final defeat of the Third Reich and the hatred it advocated? Or is that impossible? The 20th-century corruption of the swastika came to represent so much of the horrors of Nazism that it should never be forgotten. Ad The answer, although not a neat one, may be that there will always be two utterly conflicting interpretations of the swastika, both of which are part of our history, present and future: one representing the worst of humanity and the other symbolising the best.",

(Photo by Getty Images) Name: Helios Origin: Greek Known as: God of the Sun, often regarded as a Titan Family: Son of Hyperion and Theia, brother of Selene (goddess of the Moon) and Eos (goddess of the dawn) Revered as the embodiment of the Sun, the Greek god Helios was believed to drive a horse-drawn chariot from east to west across the sky each day, marking the passage of day into night. Depictions often show him as a handsome man adorned in purple robes with a crown of Sun rays encircling his head. Although Helios was venerated across the Hellenistic world, his most significant cult centres were in Corinth and on the island of Rhodes, where he was patron. In fact, the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, depicts him. Erected around 280 BC, it stood for less than 60 years before collapsing in an earthquake.

As the son of Zeus and Leto   born on the island of Delos alongside his twin sister, Artemis  Apollo held a prominent position among the Olympian deities. He was one of the most multi-faceted deities in the mythology, covering domains including music and dance, truth and prophecy, medicine and healing. His association with the arts meant the handsome and young Apollo was often depicted carrying a lyre, which he played to enchant both gods and mortals. He was also patron of the Muses, the goddesses of literature, science and the arts. Yet Apollo could equally be seen as an archer, able to bring disease and destruction with his arrows and known for his sometimes merciless retribution. Perhaps his most famous myth is his pursuit of Daphne, a nymph who did not reciprocate his love and transformed into a laurel tree to escape his advances. In her honour, Apollo adopted the laurel as his sacred plant.

(Photo by Getty Images) Name: Sol Origin: Roman Known as: God of the sun Family: None spoken of in the mythology Helios s counterpart among the Roman gods was Sol, who would be similarly depicted driving a four-horse chariot across the sky and wearing a solar crown. Among the temples dedicated to Sol in Rome, there was a shrine at the Circus Maximus, the chief arena for chariot racing, and Sol had another on the Quirinal (one of the seven hills of Rome). There, every 9 August, an annual sacrifice was left for Sol, which evolved into an act to commemorate Julius Caesar s victory at the battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC. Romans would gather to pay homage and seek his favour for bountiful harvests and protection from the darkness. Sol Invictus A relief of Sol Invictus along with Jupiter Dolichenus carved into marble. (Photo by: PHAS/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Name: Sol Invictus Origin: Roman Known as: God of the  unconquered Sun  Family: Associated with the earlier Sun god, Sol His name meaning  unconquered Sun , Sol Invictus was a later adaptation of Sol, while also amalgamating influences from Eastern religions. He was a powerful figure, often wearing military attire. In the third century AD, the roman emperor Aurelian revived the cult of Sol Invictus by establishing him as the primary deity in the Roman empire. Sol Invictus was celebrated with the festival Dies Natalis Solis Invicti on 25 December, the date that Romans celebrated the winter solstice. It is debated whether this celebration predated Christmas, or if it was chosen to be on the same day as the Christian festival. Regardless, Sol Invictus held his lofty position in the Roman pantheon until the spread of Christianity.

(Photo by Pierce Archive LLC/Buyenlarge via Getty Images) Name: Surya Origin: Hindu Known as: God of the sun Family: Son of Kashyapa (one of the Saptarishis, the seven ancient sages of the Rigveda) and Aditi (mother of the Adityas, a group of celestial deities) Surya is a prominent god of Hinduism going back to the Vedic texts of c1500 BC, once one of the five major deities alongside Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti and Ganesha. He was worshipped as a representation of all life. Like other Sun gods, Surya was shown riding a chariot, but his would be drawn by either seven horses or a single, seven-headed horse. The number represented the seven days of the week. His head would be encircled by sunlight, he carried lotus flowers in his hands, and he wore a close-fitting coat and high boots (or Scythian dress, which may suggest that he was influenced by religious iconography or Iran). According to the Puranas (ancient Hindu texts), the weapons of the gods were forged from pieces trimmed from Surya, highlighting his importance in divine protection. With temples dedicated to him across India, such as Konark Sun Temple in Odisha, worshippers perform Surya Namaskar (sun salutation) during their morning rituals, which pay homage and seek his blessings.

(Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Name: Ra Origin: Egyptian Known as: God of the Sun and father of all the Egyptian gods Family: Father of the primordial gods Shu and Tefnut Ra (sometimes known as Re) was considered both the god of the Sun and the Sun itself. Rather than a chariot, he travelled across the sky in boats to bring light and warmth to the world. At night, Ra descended into the underworld to battle the serpent Apophis, who sought to prevent the Sun from rising and therefore destroy all life on Earth. With the head of a falcon and crowned with a solar disk, Ra was the creator god responsible for bringing the gods and mortals into existence. His importance is reflected in his merging with other deities, such as Amun to create the all-powerful god Amun-Ra. Worshipped throughout Egypt, the city of Heliopolis was one of the primary centres of the cult of this ancient Egyptian god. A relief depicting Akhenaten as a sphinx offering to the sun god Aten. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) Name: Aten Origin: Egyptian Known as: The solar disk Family: Aten has no creation myth or family mentioned in mythology During the reign of the pharaoh Akhenaten (c1353-1336 BC), the Egyptian pantheon was thrown out, including the chief deity Amun, and a little-known cult was established to be the only god. That was Aten, the solar disc. Akhenaten (originally called Amenhotep IV) built a new capital called Akhetaten (now Amarna) to be the religious centre of Atenism, and introduced a radical new artform. The Aten would be represented simply as a solar disk with rays extending down   usually towards the pharaoh and his family   ending in hands, symbolising the life-giving energy of the Aten. After Akhenaten died, his religious revolution was deemed heresy: the old gods were restored and the Aten removed. Honourable mentions: Khepri | God of the morning sun, represented with the head of a scarab beetle or simply in the form of the scarab beetle itself African Sun gods Lisa Name: Lisa Origin: West African Known as: God of the Sun to the Fon people Family: Twin brother of Mawu (goddess of the moon) Lisa was worshipped by the Fon people   who lived in Dahomey (now Benin) and parts of what are now Togo, in West Africa   as the embodiment of heat, work and strength. He and his sister Mawu, the goddess of the Moon, were central to the Vodun (Voodoo) tradition, together balancing the day and night. The mythology sometimes describes Lisa and Mawu as lovers who created the universe together; elsewhere, they are represented as a single being encompassing both male and female. Lisa was believed to govern the skill of craftmanship, bringing his son Gu to Earth to teach mortals essential skills, such as ironworking, home building and agriculture. In rituals and festivals, he was invoked to bless the fields with sunlight and provide the strength needed for the day s labour. Honourable mentions: Anyanwu | Goddess of the Sun in Igbo mythology, also of good fortune, knowledge, and wisdom Nzambi | God of the Sun, and supreme deity in traditional Kongo mythology Aztec Sun gods Huitzilopochtli Engraving depicting the Aztec Sun god Huitzilopochtli. (Photo by: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Name: Huitzilopochtli Origin: Aztec Known as: God of the Sun and war Family: Thought to be the son of Coatlicue (Earth goddess) Also a god of war, Huitzilopochtli was considered one of the most important amongst the Aztec pantheon. So revered, he was the patron of the capital city of Tenochtitlan and the Aztecs even referred to themselves as  the people of the Sun . According to two different stories in the mythology, Huitzilopochtli was either the son of Ometeotl (the name of a pair of creator deities) or was immaculately conceived by Coatlicue, the Earth goddess. In one version, he was born fully grown and armoured and immediately fought his brothers and sisters. Huitzilopochtli wielded Xiuhcoatl, the fire serpent, as a weapon. His name originates from Nahuatl, the main language of the Aztecs, and translates to 'hummingbird of the left  (Aztecs believed the best warriors were reincarnations of hummingbirds). Huitzilopochtli was often depicted as the bird or a warrior in its feathers. Tonatiuh Head of Tonatiuh. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) Name: Tonatiuh Origin: Aztec Known as: God of the  Fifth Sun  Family: Born through the self-sacrifice of a god, who threw himself in a fire According to the mythology of the Nahua, Mesoamerican peoples of central Mexico of which the Aztec belonged, it was believed that there had been four cycles of the world. Each of these  Suns  had its own creation and destruction. Tonatiuh was the  Fifth Sun , the solar deity of the final cycle. He was created and rose into the sky through the self-sacrifice of a weaker god. Associated with the eagle, he would be born each day at dawn and had to be encouraged by the gods on his travels across the sky, before dying at each sunset. The Aztecs kept him on his journey by daily offerings of blood, so his worship was linked with human sacrifice. Honourable mentions: Nanahuatzin | The god, whose name means  full of sores , that threw himself into fire to be transformed into Tonatiuh Incan Sun gods Inti A design representing the sun deity, Inti. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) Name: Inti Origin: Incan Known as: God of the Sun and patron deity of the Incan empire Family: Brother of Mama Quilla (goddess of the Moon) The Inca believed that the Sun god Inti was the direct ancestor of their emperor, the Sapa Inca, and his family. Unsurprisingly, Inti s cult was imposed across the empire to reinforce the Sapa Inca s right to rule. Depicted as a golden disk with rays shining out from his human face, Inti was central to Incan religious practices: the temple dedicated to him, Coricancha in the capital of Cusco, was the most important in the empire; and his festival, Inti Raymi, celebrated at the winter solstice (which in the southern hemisphere is in June), was one of the most significant events in the Incan calendar. It marked the return of the sun and the renewal of life. The Inca called upon him to control the agricultural cycle, ensuring the growth of crops and the prosperity of the empire. Honourable mentions: Illapa | While not a Sun god, the thunder god was the lord of the weather overall Mayan Sun Gods Kinich Ahau Wall decoration depicting the Sun god Kinich Ahau. (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images) Name: Kinich Ahau Origin: Mayan Known as: God of the Sun, who controlled disease and drought Family: Brother of Chaac (god of rain, thunder and lightning) in some mythologies In Mayan art, Kinich Ahau is seen as an old man with large, square eyes, a hooked nose and a sharpened tooth. He could also be presented as animals associated with power, such as a jaguar or eagle. Kinich Ahau, like other solar deities, travelled across the sky during the day and descended into the underworld at night. His status can be shown by the names of rulers in Mayan cultures; they would include  Kinich  in their titles to revere the Sun god. Honourable mentions: Itzamn  | The creator god who resided in the sky as the ruler of day and night Chinese Sun gods Xihe Xihe, Mother of the Suns. (Photo by Getty Images) Name: Xihe Origin: Chinese Known as: Goddess of the Sun and mother of the Ten Suns Family: One of the two wives of Di Jun (one of the early Chinese supreme deities) Xihe would ride her carriage across the sky every day, but she did not bring light to the world herself. The goddess would choose one of her children   the ten Suns, who took the form of three-legged crows and lived in a mulberry tree   to do the task on each day. According to legend, there once was a time when all ten Suns rose together, causing the Earth to overheat and wither. A skilled archer named Hou Yi had no choice but to shoot down nine of them, leaving one to provide a suitable amount of light and warmth. Honourable mentions: Hou Yi | While not a solar deity, the Lord Archer saved the world by shooting down 9 of the 10 Suns Japanese Sun gods Amaterasu An illustration of Amaterasu. (Photo by: Pictures From History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Name: Amaterasu Origin: Japanese Known as: Goddess of the Sun and the queen of heaven and creation Family: Daughter of Izanagi (creator god) and elder sister of Tsukuyomi (god of the Moon) and Susanoo (god of storms) A chief deity in the Shinto religion, Amaterasu   whose name means  great divinity illuminating heaven    is considered the ancestor of the Japanese imperial family. According to legend, she retreated into a cave following a dispute with her brother Susanoo, and plunged the world into darkness. The other gods lured her out by collecting cockerels to crow, hanging a mirror outside the cave and performing a joyous dance, which made Amaterasu curious. When she looked out, she saw her reflection in the mirror, thus restoring sunlight to the world. Amaterasu is worshipped at the Grand Shrine of Ise, one of the most important Shinto shrines in Japan. Although it has ancient roots, it is never more than 20 years old: beginning in the seventh century, the shrine is rebuilt every 20 years (with some gaps during the Warring State era) to demonstrate the continued importance of Amaterasu.

(Photo by: PHAS/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Name: Shamash Origin: Mesopotamian Known as: God of the Sun and a divine judge Family: Son of Sin (god of the Moon) Shamash, known as Utu in Sumerian mythology, was a powerful and all-seeing deity who travelled across the sky by day, observing the world and dispensing justice. Depicted as a bearded man seated on a throne and holding a rod and ring   symbols of justice and divine authority   Shamash s role as divine judge meant he was associated with the underworld and divination. His iconography frequently included a solar disk, reinforcing his role as Sun god, but such was his role in justice that he would also appear in ancient Mesopotamian legal texts. Most famously, Shamash s image was carved on the Code of Hammurabi, a collection of laws from 18th-century BC Babylon. Honourable mentions: Aya | Goddess of the dawn, and the wife of Shamash Norse Sun gods S l Skoll the wolf chasing Sol across the sky.

In her task, she rode on a horse-drawn chariot and had to travel at great speed as she was being pursued by a great wolf named Skoll. Her brother was hunted by another wolf, Hati. Their destiny was to be caught by these wolves at Ragnar k, the Norse end of the world.

        "title": "A perilous game of hide and seek: the history of priest holes and hunters",
        "content": "Sixteenth-century Tudor England under Elizabeth I was a dangerous place for those who practised the Catholic faith. Ad How did leaders of this forbidden religion hide? The answer was priest holes, secret hiding spots built into people s homes that offered refuge to those who needed it. Why were priest holes needed? The creation of priest holes can be traced back to the Reformation. When the Pope refused to grant Henry VIII an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, he split from the Catholic Church and founded the Church of England. His son, Edward VI, in an effort to continue his father s work and solidify England as a Protestant state, commissioned Archbishop Thomas Cranmer in 1549 to write the Book of Common Prayer. However, Edward was soon succeeded by his half-sister Mary in 1553, who restored England to Catholicism. Those who refused to renounce their Protestant faith were burned at the stake, earning her the divisive nickname  Bloody Mary . When it was Elizabeth I s turn to rule, she reverted back to Protestantism, restoring the Church of England her father had established and passing the Act of Uniformity in 1559. Originally, non-conformists faced fines and imprisonment, but as plots emerged to overthrow Elizabeth in favour of her Catholic cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, the penalties became harsher. From 1559, it became high treason for a Catholic priest to even enter England, and anyone aiding them faced severe punishment.  Many people, wealthy and poor in England, believed that Catholicism was the true faith and attempted to keep practising it,  explains Stephanie Barczewski on an episode of the HistoryExtra podcast.  So priests would sneak into the country, very much at peril of their own lives, and would then find refuge in the houses of wealthy people.  What were priest holes used for? Looking down into a priest hole in Boscobel House, Shropshire. In 1651, Charles II used this as a hiding place from the Roundheads. (Photo by Alamy) Priest holes were secret hiding spots built into people s homes, to conceal Catholic clergy during government raids. These hides also stored Catholic paraphernalia such as candles, crucifixes and incense. The hiding places would often be very small, and came in a variety of forms: they could be behind wall panels, or high up in the attics of a house. Those using these priest holes would have to escape pursuivants, or  priest hunters . The people in this role conducted thorough searches under Elizabeth I s orders. Pursuivants would compare the number of windows outside and inside, rip up floorboards, and tap walls to detect hollow spaces. They even pretended to leave to see if anyone would emerge, or stayed in the vicinity of suspected hideouts for weeks to force hidden priests to reveal themselves. Unable to escape for fear of being executed, many died of starvation. Those who were found met a gruesome end:  You would have these episodes of terrible violence where they would be dragged out,  explains Barczewski.  [They were] usually not executed on the spot, but would be taken away, put on some sort of trial which there was a foregone conclusion as to how it was going to come out and then they would be executed, not in a humane way [ ] beheaded, drawn, quartered, the full early modern spectacle.  What did priest holes look like? The design of priest holes varied greatly, but they had one thing in common: these hides were often cramped, allowing no room to stand or stretch. Harvington Hall in Worcestershire showcases a great range of priest holes. Among the seven known to exist in the house, there is one above a bread oven packed with a layer of earth to prevent burning, another hidden behind a wall accessed via a swing-out beam covered with panelling, and a hide in an attic reached through a false chimney. Underground hides were rare but did exist, such as the one at Baddesley Clinton in Warwickshire, which is located below the house in the original sewers. It was accessed via the shaft of a garderobe (a medieval toilet). Who was the most famous priest hole maker? Nicholas Owen was known for his masterful priest holes. He began designing and building them in the 1580s   and was known for his ability to baffle even the canniest of priest hunters. He worked under the alias of  Little John , usually in the dead of night or under the ruse of a different construction project, to avoid detection. Owen is also credited as the mastermind of Jesuit Father John Gerard s escape from the Tower of London in 1597. Despite Gerard s hands being mangled from torture, he managed to pull himself across a rope suspended over its moat. However, Owen was captured by the Queen s forces in 1606, during the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot, and taken to the Tower of London. By this point, he had suffered from ill health   including a limp from a poorly set bone. There were rules in place to prevent the torture of those with physical impairments, but this didn t stop Robert Cecil demanding that Owen be taken to the Tower of London and tortured to encourage him giving up knowledge. Richard Topcliffe   an infamous torturer in the Tower of London under Elizabeth I   put Owen on the rack. The torture of a prisoner on the rack in sixteenth-century England. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) After several days of torture, he remained silent, so the torturers kept adding weight to his feet in frustration. Eventually, Owen s intestines bulged out through a hernia. Topcliffe ordered that they be secured by a metal plate, which led to Owen bleeding to death in his cell and dying the next day. The state announced that he had taken his own life. Ad He was canonised in 1970 as St Nicholas Owen, the patron saint of illusionists and escapologists.",

        "title": "The Gordon Riots: how an anti-Catholic petition escalated into the most destructive riots in London s history",
        "content": "On 2 June 1780, a crowd of between 40,000 to 60,000 people gathered outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, having marched from St George s Fields, to present a petition. Though soldiers managed to disperse the masses and arrest some of their number, this was just the beginning. Ad Over the next five days, this protest escalated into the most destructive riots in London s history. Protestors attacked buildings, including Newgate Prison and the Bank of England, and many lives were lost. But what drove these people to such violent action? What caused the Gordon Riots? The burning of Newgate Prison. (Photo by The Print Collector/Getty Images) The Gordon Riots were fuelled by Protestant opposition to the Catholic Relief Act of 1778. This legislation lifted many restrictions on the civil rights of Catholics that had been imposed by the Popery Act of 1698. With reduced legislative discrimination, Catholics were able to join the army and buy or sell land if they took an oath of allegiance. Lord George Gordon, a British politician and Protestant, vehemently opposed this, and his opposition was shared by many other Protestants. They feared that these newfound freedoms would enable Catholics to commit treasonous acts and jeopardise British security. On the podcast | Britain's Catholic emancipation To counter this, Lord Gordon initiated a petition to repeal the Catholic Relief Act, which he claimed to have 120,000 signatures. On 2 June, he led a group of between 40,000 and 60,000 to Parliament, then under the administration of prime minister Lord North, to present it. Lord Gordon entered the Houses of Parliament and presented the petition himself. He and the protestors demanded immediate consideration of their request; this was denied by parliament, but a discussion was scheduled for the following Tuesday. However, this didn t placate the crowds, and what began as a civil petition soon descended into violent riots. Why were they called the Gordon Riots? The Gordon Riots were named after Lord George Gordon, who organised the petition against the Catholic Relief Act. The son of the 3rd Duke of Gordon, he was a politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1774 to 1780. A year before the Gordon Riots, in 1779, he became the first president of the Protestant Association, which was formed as an immediate response to the Act. It had the support of notable religious figures, including Rowland Hill and John Rippon. How violent were the Gordon Riots? Rioters accosting Lord William Mansfield. (Photo by Culture Club/Getty Images) The Gordon Riots were among the most destructive in English history. The violence began on 2 June, when the crowd attacked the carriages of Members of Parliament as they arrived at Westminster, holding them personally responsible for the Catholic Relief Act. Lord Chief Justice Mansfield s carriage was damaged and the glass shattered, while the Duke of Northumberland had his watch stolen. Many MPs also had their homes ransacked. Lord Mansfield s residence was attacked and his extensive library burned, resulting in significant financial loss. Rioters also targeted his country estate, Kenwood House on Hampstead Heath, but were diverted by a guard who bribed them with free ale at a nearby inn. Over the following days, rioters also targeted government buildings, including Newgate Prison, where some members of the original crowd outside parliament were being held. Dr Madeleine Pelling has written on the role that graffiti played in the riots, and how some in the crowd painted a battle cry across the prison s crumbling walls:  His Majesty King Mob.  The rioters freed 300 prisoners   many of whom would never be recaptured. The Spaniard's Inn, Hampstead. (Photo by Bridgeman via Getty Images) On 7 June, known as  Black Wednesday , the riot peaked with an attempt to destroy the Bank of England. One journal, the Annual Register, called it  one of the most dreadful spectacles this country ever beheld,  adding that  every thing served to impress the mind with ideas of universal anarchy and approaching desolation (sic).  In response, martial law was enacted, allowing thousands of troops to shoot rioters on site. By this point, Lord George Gordon tried to calm and disperse the rioters, but his efforts were in vain. He declared his wish to  join the forces of law and order , turning against the crowd. Groups like this would have been read the Riot Act, which was passed in 1714 in response to the increasing number of mobs in Britain. When crowds gathered, Jonny Wilkes explains,  a public official would have to stand before them   either a brave or foolhardy thing to do . They read the following proclamation of the Riot Act:  Our sovereign Lord the King chargeth and commandeth all persons, being assembled, immediately to disperse themselves, and peaceably to depart to their habitations, or to their lawful business, upon the pains contained in the act made in the first year of King George, for preventing tumults and riotous assemblies. God save the King.  Those who didn t disperse after this proclamation were dealt harsh penalties. During that night and the following day, 285 people were shot dead by the militia, another 200 wounded, and around 450 arrested. Notably, none of those arrested had signed the petition, suggesting that this riot had grown far beyond the original protest outside the Houses of Parliament. By Thursday evening, 8 June, following the arrests and deaths of many, the rioting had subsided. What happened to those who took part in the riots? Lord George Gordon during his imprisonment the Tower of London, 1780, convicted of high treason for his role in instigating The Gordon Riots. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Out of the 450 arrested for their part in the Gordon Riots, 160 were tried at either the King s Bench court in Southwark, or the Old Bailey. Of these, 26 were hanged for their involvement in the riots. Lord George Gordon was imprisoned for eight months and tried for high treason in 1781. His cousin, a lawyer named Thomas Erskine, successfully argued for his acquittal, citing his lack of treasonous intent. Although Gordon had led the protestors originally to the Houses of Parliament, Erskine argued, he did not explicitly order the riots. Read more | Timeline: a history of prisons in Britain However, Gordon s legal troubles continued. In 1787, he published a paper criticising the severity of criminal law in England, also making derogatory comments about queen consort of France Marie Antoinette and Jean-Balthazar d Adh mar, the French ambassador to Great Britain. For this crime, he was given a five-year jail sentence at Newgate on 28 January 1788, where he died in 1793 from typhoid. Did anything change as a result of the Gordon Riots? The Gordon Riots made other European countries question the stability of the British government, which was significant as Britain sought to solidify European alliances. In fact, the Spanish government, upon learning of the riots, retreated from its peace negotiations with Britain. This event also underscored the power of popular dissent, which was eventually restrained with the 1795 Grenville and Pitt Bills, otherwise known as the  Gagging Acts , to prevent mass meetings and petitions. Ad These measures reflected a cautious approach to public gatherings, a legacy that continues to influence the use of protest and petitions today.",

        "content": "Practically everyone in the English-speaking world knows about Valentine s Day. Celebrants buy more chocolates, flowers and jewellery on 14 February than on any other day of the year and only Christmas occasions more greeting cards. So what is the history behind this commercial celebration? Ad What is Saint Valentine the patron saint of? Catholics still regard Valentine as the patron saint of engaged couples; happy marriages; love; and lovers. Yet a patron saint of love and lovers is not exactly compatible with Christian doctrine, which has always emphasised the joys of self-denial. Celibacy has been a requirement for priesthood since the Middle Ages, and virginity won sainthood for hundreds of women. Therefore, a saint who sponsors the exchange of candy and kisses between lovers seems doctrinally dubious. So where did this saint come from, and how did he become the impresario of sweethearts? Who was the real Saint Valentine? If you consult Wikipedia or Catholic Encyclopedia, or more popular digital publications such as Buzzfeed and History.com, you will read that Valentine lived in the third century, was either a priest or a bishop in Rome, and was jailed by the Roman emperor for being a Christian in the period when the religion remained illegal. A 19th-century depiction of St Valentine, here shown as a bishop of Terni. (Image by Getty Images) Catholic news sites claim that Valentine s crime was performing marriage rites for Christian lovers; alternatively, some say he carried messages between jailed Christians and, before he was executed, left a letter to a young woman signed  your Valentine . But if you dig a bit deeper to read the ancient documents, another Valentine appears. In fact, it turns out there were quite a few Valentines in the Roman Empire. The name was popular among Christians and others because it means  powerful  or  worthy . It turns out there were quite a few Valentines in the Roman Empire It seems that three different martyrs named Valentinus died on 14 February during the reign of Emperor Claudius Gothicus (r268 270); none of whom married Christian couples or carried messages between jailed Christians. One was a general stationed in Africa. The martyrologies (lists of martyrs organised by death date) say only that  In Africa Valentini & militum viginti quatuor [He perished] in Africa with two dozen troops . We know nothing more about him. The second was Bishop Valentinus of Terni, a town about 70 miles northeast of Rome; and the third was a Roman priest. According to the vitae (hagiographies) of the latter two, they both performed miraculous cures, debated with pagan jailors, and lost their heads in Rome. Bishop Valentinus of Terni: the real Saint Valentine? According to his fifth- or sixth-century hagiographer, Bishop Valentinus of Terni was summoned to Rome sometime in the 260s to cure the son of a rhetor [or orator] named Craton, who kept a school and housed visiting Greek scholars. His son Chaeremon, who was also a budding student of philosophy, had contracted a debilitating sickness that curved his spine and prevented him from walking, and Craton learned that the cleric had healed similar cases. But when he arrived, Bishop Valentine first tried to persuade Craton to become a Christian. Craton, trained in Hellenistic philosophy [Greek philosophy during the period running from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC to the end of the Roman Republic in 31 BC, known as the Hellenistic Age], found the tenets of Christianity to be illogical and ridiculous.  How can water, which washes filth off the body, clean away sins?!  he demanded. The debate dragged on as Chaeremon lay suffering and dying until Craton desperately struck a deal. If Valentine cured the boy, Craton s entire household would convert. Valentine then spent the night praying alone with Chaeremon. The next morning, Chaeremon appeared hale and hearty. Everyone, including Craton, his family, servants, and the visiting Greeks, accepted baptism. When the Roman senate got wind of the business they promptly arrested Valentine, had him beaten, and then decapitated. The visiting scholars took the martyr s body back to Terni to bury it. Unfortunately, Roman soldiers caught them and beheaded them as well. A third Valentinus The third Valentinus, according to his vita, was a priest of Rome also arrested for preaching Christianity in the time of Claudius Gothicus [Roman emperor 268 270]. As several modern scholars have pointed out, Claudius was hardly ever in Rome   he earned his name by fighting off invading Germanic barbarians up north   and he never ordered a persecution of Christians. Whatever the priest Valentinus did to annoy the government, he was supposedly hauled before Claudius and he took the opportunity to preach. Claudius seemed rather interested at first, but a prefect named Calpurnius warned the emperor:  You are being seduced into a false religion!  A 15th-century illumination showing Saint Valentine (far left), Saint Stephen and Saint Maximilian. (Image by Getty Images) Claudius sent Valentine into house arrest at the home of an aristocrat named Asterius, who was promised riches if he could subdue the priest with arguments against Christianity. Of course, Valentine began preaching the minute he arrived at the house, discoursing on Christ as the light of the world. Asterius replied that he had a blind daughter, and said if Valentine s god could open her eyes to the light of day, Asterius would become a Christian. Valentine lay hands on the girl s eyes and prayed that she might see the light. When she opened her eyes and looked around her, Asterius fell to Valentine s feet and begged to be saved. Valentine quickly began baptising everyone around him, making 44 new Christians from Asterius s household. But Claudius soon found out and had them all thrown in prison. Valentine was beheaded, along with several others who became renowned as martyrs. Visiting Valentine as a cure for illness None of the three Valentine s biographies was earlier than the fifth century   that s at least 200 years after any of the saints supposedly lived. Neither written nor material evidence from the pre-medieval period associates any of these Valentines with love or lovers. The word  amor , Latin for  love , doesn t appear in the texts. Even when promoting their God, the two better-known Valentines never spoke in terms of affection but only faith and illumination. Instead, they became known in subsequent centuries for curing those who suffered, as Chaeremon did, from  falling sickness    that is, epilepsy. Pilgrims, lured by the legends, came to visit the graves of both Valentines for cures, not for love. Religious tourists made the rounds of martyrs  burials, praying for the saints  help with illness and for intercession with God. Some went to Bishop Valentine of Terni lying quietly in his Umbrian tomb outside the city of his birth. Others attended the Roman Valentine who was supposedly buried in a crypt near the site of his execution, just outside the city walls on the Via Flaminia of Rome. Devotees of Roman Valentine may have built a church over his grave as early as the fourth century, though more likely it was named after the much richer Valentine who funded it. They began calling the city gate there Valentine s Gate (today it is known as the Porta del Populo.) Nineteenth-century excavations at the site revealed fourth- and fifth-century burials as well as fragments inscribed with Valentine s name. After some centuries, either pilgrims sought other saints, or Valentine s shrine declined when Pope Nicholas IV (died in 1292) ordered that Valentine s body be moved to a new home at Santa Prassede, a flourishing parish centre where many other saints  remains were housed. Throughout the European Middle Ages, Valentine remained no more or less popular than other ancient Roman martyrs. Every 14 February, church lectors across Europe read out the life of one or the other or both Valentines. Medieval writers sometimes mixed up their Valentines, attributing the miracles of one to another. When did Valentine become a saint? Eventually, some medieval scholars grew suspicious about the striking similarities between the stories of the bishop and the priest. They knew that after the empire dwindled, Rome had become a ruined pile of broken, nameless graves, where anyone might reclaim the bones of a  martyr . Bishops and abbots eager for relics did not always properly authenticate the remains of bodies; the shreds of blood-soaked cloth; and the other objects hauled out of crypts and sent northward as relics. Hagiographers, sensing an opportunity, revised saints  legends to advertise the presence of relics in their churches. One Breton bishop recorded the slew of miracles that enriched Valentine s reputation at the end of the 11th century, when the saint s skull somehow ended up in Roquemaure, where it was exhibited every year on his feast day. That same skull later went to Tarragona, while other bits of the Valentines turned up all over Europe: a skull remains on display in the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome; Saint Anton s church in Madrid has some bones, as does Santa Maria Assunta in Savona; and a Carmelite church in Dublin. There s also a bone in Prague (SS. Peter and Paul); a chunk of skull in Chelmno (St Mary s Assumption); and other slivers in: the parish church of the Oratory in Birmingham (England   look under the St Athanasius altar); Glasgow (Church of Blessed Saint John Duns Scotus); and in the Church of Metastasis of Virgin Mary in Mytilene, on the island of Lesbos. The Stephansdom in Vienna brashly claims to have the whole body. Neither inscriptions on reliquaries that housed his bones, nor sculpture or pictures betrayed Valentine s association with love. Illuminations and sculptures of Valentine typically showed him as a bishop with staff or a tonsured monk holding a book. In early printed volumes of the 16th century, Valentine often bent over victims of epilepsy or plague. Other scenes depicted eager executioners chopping off his head. Not a single picture showed the saint passing messages or marrying lovers. Valentine himself appeared more stern than romantic. When did Saint Valentine become associated with love? Modern literary scholars credit one man for turning Valentine into the patron of love: Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales and other poetic works. Chaucer s Parlement of Foules [aka Parliament of Fowls], an allegorical tale thought to have been written during the negotiations of Richard II s marriage to Anne of Bohemia in 1380, mentioned  seynt Volantynys day/ Whan euery bryd comyth there to chese his make. [Saint Valentine s day, when every bird comes there to choose his mate.]  Bird love apparently occurred on Valentine s feast day at the start of the English spring. Chaucer was a major influencer in his day   after him, everyone began calling their beloved 'Valentine' Chaucer may have read the hagiographies of Valentine in local English versions. He may have been aware, too, that yet another head of Valentine lay at Hyde Abbey, just outside the walls of Winchester, as literary scholar Jack Oruch has pointed out ( Saint Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February , Speculum 56:3 [1981]). But the love connection was Chaucer s creation. Chaucer was a major influencer in his day   after him, everyone began calling their beloved  Valentine  and writing love poems on 14 February. Literary acquaintances of Chaucer were among the first to do so in print. Oton de Granson III (died c1397), for instance, wrote three long complainctes to Saint Valentine, as well as poems about the  Wish  and  Dream  of Valentine; while John Gower (died in 1408), who wrote copiously about love, referred to Valentine in two of his ballades. Across the water, Christine de Pizan in her Dit de la Rose described how French knights formed a fictional Order of the Rose on Saint Valentine s Day. Geoffrey Chaucer (c1340-1400) depicted as a pilgrim on horseback in a detail from an early illuminated manuscript edition of 'The Canterbury Tales'. (Image by Getty Images) The religious studies scholar Leigh Schmidt has suggested that Valentine remained important to churchgoers and those who suffered epilepsy as a martyr who died on 14 February ( The Fashioning of a Modern Holiday , Winterthur Portfolio 28:4 [1993]). The Anglican Book of Common Prayer explained that Saint Valentine was  famous for his love and charity , and thus a suitable sponsor of romance. When were the first Valentine s cards? Valentine became more popular as a patron of love and lovers in two contexts: among aristocratic circles and in folk custom. Poets such as William Shakespeare and John Donne continued Chaucer s tradition of using Valentine and his day as symbols of love. While they composed verses to honour the holiday, others exchanged gifts. In rural communities, meanwhile, men and women got together on Valentine s Day to make merry and play games, such as drawing lots for Valentines sweethearts and divination   conjuring up the identity of one s future spouse. By the 19th century, English consumers were ready and eager for Valentine's cards with poems already printed on them, preferably decorated with love birds, hearts and Cupid (rather than the image of a headless Roman bishop). A 19th-century Valentine card. (Image by Getty Images) The London Journal of 1858 supported the custom of exchanging observance love tokens on Valentine s Day, declaring that it was both  natural  and  proper  that, at the start of spring,  the predominating sentiment in the human mind should be the sentiment of love; and to this accordingly the anniversary of our saint is directed . However, the publication preferred home-made cards to mass-produced Valentines, about which the editors opined:  If we were to give a general character, we would say they are very trashy and not a little vulgar; and  the production of mercenaries for hire.  It s probably a good thing that the Journal s editors never saw today s variety of Valentine advertisements, cards, decorations and gifts. Are there ancient associations between Valentine and love? Despite the evidence for Chaucer s transformation of Valentine s Day, some scholars have continued to seek ancient causes for Valentine s modern associations with passion and romance. In the 19th century, historians scoured the sources of classical history for evidence of celebrations in mid-February. They found Lupercalia, a holiday associated with Faunus or Pan, celebrated with a carnival on the Ides of February (15 February.) Colleges or clubs of young noblemen sacrificed goats or dogs on an altar in the cave where, according to legend, Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, were suckled by the famous she-wolf. According to Plutarch, they cut strips for thongs from the bloody hides and ran half-naked around the Palatine hill of Rome, striking nubile women with their thongs to confer fertility. Supposedly, the young men also drew lots for sexual partners. Read more | A brief guide to ancient Rome and the Romans, plus 9 fascinating facts After Romans became Christians, Pope Gelasius I (d496) prohibited celebrations of Lupercalia and, according to these same modern scholars, substituted the more chaste celebration of a Valentine s feast day. Other recent scholars have blamed instead Emperor Claudius, who allegedly banned young men from getting married in the third century. Claudius needed more soldiers for his campaigns, so the argument goes, hence soldiers were required by law to remain single while serving. In this version of Valentine s saintly past, Valentine heroically resisted the emperor and married Christian couples. Yet in reality, Claudius never forbade marriage because he was too busy securing his eastern frontier to decree laws in Rome. These explanations for Valentine s Day remain far more popular than the  Chaucer Theory . Updated hagiographies of Valentine and church websites report as facts that an identifiable third-century bishop named Valentine offended the Roman emperor by marrying soldiers and their lovers, and/or passing notes among jailed lovers, and paid for it with his life. Mainstream digital publications claiming to reveal the  true story of the real Saint Valentine  tell similar stories (although those authors who research as far as Wikipedia mention Chaucer s influence). How ironic that modern celebrants have chosen Cupid   Greco-Roman god of erotic love   as one of the major symbols of the day when Saint Valentine lost his head. Why was Valentine removed as an official saint? Unfortunately, Valentine s revised legend probably caused his loss of saintly status in the modern Catholic church. The Vatican removed Valentine from its universal calendar of saints in 1969 because his legend lacked historical evidence. Catholics are still free to venerate the patron saint of epilepsy if they wish, but it is not a liturgical obligation. Like the rest of the world, devout fans of the saint are free to focus instead on choosing cards and gifts for their loved ones, although believers have found a way to honour the ancient saint and, at the same time, celebrate the holiday of love. At Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Dublin, the Franciscan church that claims to have relics of Valentine, petitioners leave notes to the saint begging for guidance, cures, and love.  Dear Valentine May I find a nice man to settle down with,  pleads one.  Saint Valentine may I please meet Annabelle again,  asks another (Irish Times, 8 February 2014). By the 19th century, English consumers were ready and eager for Valentine's cards with poems already printed on them. (Image by Getty Images) We don t know who the real Valentine was, because our best evidence consists of legends   ancient Christian legends; legends of burials and relics; legends of mating birds and love lotteries; of pagan debauches and wholesome romance. No one is sure exactly who Valentine (or Valentines) was (or were); or why Christians of late antiquity came to revere him. Meanwhile, the myth-making continues. In 2017, a Brazilian forensic anthropologist used photos of the skull fragment kept in Santa Maria in Cosmedin and reconstructed the face of Saint Valentine (MailOnline, 13 February 2017)   but which one?

        "content": "Ad Early Jewish settlement 19th century Palestine did not formally exist as a country before the First World War, when the British fixed Palestine s borders after their conquest of what would become Iraq, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. For hundreds of years before the British took control, Palestine had been divided into provinces of the Ottoman empire, and had very few Jewish inhabitants. Indeed, at the start of the 19th century the Jewish population of the territory soon to be defined as Palestine was small   only about 3%. The majority of the region s inhabitants were Arabs, mostly Sunni Muslim, who had occupied the region since the seventh-century Arab conquest; there was also a sizeable Christian minority. Together, these formed the population that would be considered   despite the lack of a formally recognised country   as Palestinians. The Jewish people of Palestine in 1800 were not farmers or settlers but instead lived in towns and worked as merchants or religious teachers. As the 19th century progressed, European Jews   influenced by the rise of nationalism in Europe   began to look to Palestine as the place for a possible Jewish homeland. A wave of Jewish people came to the country in an Aliyah ( ascent ) starting in the 1880s, making their homes on land bought from Palestinians. This brought a new type of Jew to Palestine, there to settle the land; these adopted tough new names such as Oz ( strength ). More settlers followed as Jewish people fled anti-Semitic pogroms in Europe, a situation exacerbated by the rise of rightwing sentiment that presaged Nazi rule of Germany from 1933. Settlement was core to Zionism   a Jewish nationalist movement   because it demanded land for a Jewish state. Zionists based their national claim to Palestine on ancient Jewish settlement of the area before the Romans expelled Jews from the region in the second century AD following two major Jewish revolts against their rule. Zionism and Jewish settlement were seen as a return to an ancient Jewish Palestine.  A land without a people for a people without a land  ran a pithy Zionist slogan   yet this was not accurate: the land was already occupied by predominantly Muslim communities. The seeds of conflict 1896 1917 In 1896, an Austro-Hungarian Jewish intellectual, Theodor Herzl, published Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State), a pamphlet outlining the intellectual basis for the idea of a Jewish country. There was initially much discussion among Zionists about whether such a place was to be in Palestine or elsewhere. Early schemes proposed such disparate locations as Canada, parts of South America, and Britishrun East Africa around what is now Uganda and Kenya. European Zionist Jews were looking for a place to make real the Jewish state, and the debate fell between two major camps. The first was willing to accept a Jewish state anywhere, while the other was determined to forge a state in historic Palestine. Theodor Herzl's pamphlet Der Judenstaat (1896), proposing a Jewish country. (Photo 12/Getty Images) In 1905, at the Seventh Zionist Congress in Basel, the dispute was settled in favour of a Jewish state in Palestine rather than some part of the world with no religious or historical connection for Jewish people. Many Palestinians resisted this move to settle in the territory, and expressed their own national identity through channels such as Falastin, a newspaper founded in Jaffa in 1911 and named for their homeland. Other responses were more direct, with Palestinians aggressively targeting landowners who sold land to Jewish settlers. Jewish immigration and settlement set the two communities on the road to war. It would be a struggle in which the Zionists, armed with modern European nationalist ideas, organisation and technologies, had the edge. Riots and revolt 1917 20 In 1917, during the First World War, British-led troops conquered southern Palestine and took Jerusalem. In the same year, the British foreign secretary, AJ Balfour, issued the so-called Balfour Declaration. Sent as a letter to the Jewish (and Zionist) Lord Rothschild on 2 November, and published a week later in The Times, it was a deliberately ambiguous statement of British intent towards Palestine. It did not promise the Jewish people a state in the country; instead, it vaguely expressed the sentiment that  His Majesty s Government view with favour  the establishment of a Jewish  national home  in Palestine, while also recognising that the region had an existing, non-Jewish, population. General Edmund Allenby enters Jerusalem on foot on 11 December 1917 during the British campaign in Palestine against Ottoman forces in the First World War (Heritage Images/Getty Images) The declaration helped Britain s war effort in various ways, boosting support in the United States (which had a significant Jewish population) and providing for British control of Palestine. The Jewish settlers depended on Britain for their survival and, until the Second World War, worked with the British authorities to maintain security in Palestine. Jewish settlement was met with local resistance: in 1920, for instance, rioting broke out as Palestinians opposed British-facilitated Jewish immigration. More violence was to erupt throughout the next two decades. Jewish-European settlers in this period recorded the mood of colonialism.  We must not forget that we are dealing here with a semi-savage people, which has extremely primitive concepts,  one wrote at the time.  And this is his nature: if he senses in you power, he will submit and will hide his hatred for you. And if he senses weakness, he will dominate you.  Amid such colonial views, the British veered between support for Jewish settlers and for the Palestinians. Their goals were diverging and becoming seemingly irreconcilable. Full-scale conflict 1929 47 As violence erupted between the two communities, Jews and Palestinians divided, and people had to take sides. Early Jewish inhabitants in Palestine, and Mizrahi ( oriental  or  eastern ) Jews who came to Palestine from Arab countries and who spoke Arabic, were now confronted by politically mobilised European Jews arriving to settle the land and build a Jewish state. Many of these long-time Jewish occupants of Palestine and the Middle East cut their ties to their Arab neighbours. An outbreak of extreme violence in 1929 dashed any faint hopes of Jews and Palestinians combining, and revisionist rightwing Zionist organisations grew. Palestinians and Jews prepared for a full-scale conflict. Militant Muslim preachers such as Shaykh  Izz al-Din al-Qassam mobilised Palestinians, priming them for jihad. The Jewish population prepared much more thoroughly, building a proto-state alongside nascent political and economic structures, having already established a defence organisation, Haganah. Jewish families evacuate Jerusalem's Old City in 1936, during the Arab Revolt - an uprising that followed several years of violence between Palestinians and Jewish settlers (Universal History Archive/Getty Images) The Jewish community pushed into new land with numerous settlements, and set up a Jewish presence across Palestine. By this point, the Palestinians were in conflict with both the Jews and the British authorities in Palestine, reaching a crescendo in a mass revolt in 1936. The British army crushed the revolt by 1939, but resistance and preparation for further attacks by both communities remained the pattern for the rest of the 1930s and throughout the Second World War. By the time of the Second World War, the British had shifted their policy from support for Zionism to blocking Jewish immigration to Palestine. They did this, again, to bolster support for their war effort, this time from Arab allies. In the face of Jewish people escaping the unfolding Holocaust in Europe, this caused growing resentment and conflict with Zionists who were trying to save European Jews by helping them get to Palestine. After the war ended in 1945, the Jewish population of Palestine had become sufficiently powerful and mobilised to fight Britain, and good Jewish preparation won the day. Jewish terror attacks against British targets helped to force Britain to reconsider its geopolitical priorities. In one of the most infamous attacks, in 1946 the wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem that housed a British headquarters was blown up, killing almost 100 people. In 1947, Britain decided to leave Palestine. Meanwhile, survivors of the Holocaust who emigrated to Palestine further boosted the territory s Jewish population. In the November of the same year, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution that proposed the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. Under the plan, Jerusalem would be an internationalised city. The suggestion was accepted, albeit reluctantly, by Jewish representatives in the region, because it offered some international acceptance of their aims of establishing a state. Palestinian and Arab groups rejected it, however, arguing that it ignored the rights of most of the population of Palestine to decide their own destiny. Read more: Matthew Hughes considers why British colonial forces couldn't cope with a Jewish revolt in the 1940s, prior to the foundation of the State of Israel The birth of modern Israel 1948 49 The First Arab-Israeli War of 1948 49 followed on from the violence between Jews and Palestinians as neighbouring Arab states   for their own political motives as well as to help their Palestinian Arab brethren   intervened in the hostilities. In May 1948, as British troops left Palestine, Zionist leader (soon to become the first Israeli prime minister) David Ben-Gurion declared the formation of the state of Israel, at which point Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan, Lebanon and Syria attacked Israel in support of the Palestinians. Israel was born from war, both the legacy of the Holocaust and more immediate conflict when the Arab armies attacked in May 1948. Fighting against the new Israeli army continued until early 1949. Local Palestinian militia units supported the war effort, but were poorly organised and had little military power. In general, though the Arab forces looked impressive on paper, the military quality of their fighting power and the political unity of their command across different national forces were poor and, as a result, they lost. Palestinian refugees pictured during the first Arab-Israeli War in 1948. At the conclusion of the war the following year, some 700,000 Palestinians had fled or been expelled from the new state of Israel and were refugees in neighbouring territories (Universal History Archive/Getty Images) Israel s success allowed it to expand its territory to include all of British-run Palestine, with the exception of the hilly West Bank next to Jordan, east Jerusalem (including the Old City), and the territory known as the Gaza Strip, running along the Mediterranean Sea just northeast of the Sinai Peninsula. The result of this expansion was that Israel controlled more than 75% of what had formerly been British-run Palestine   or, in other words, the Palestinians now held less than 25% of Palestine. What happened next has informed a great deal of how we now understand the Arab-Israeli conflict. For the Palestinians this was the nakba (catastrophe) that turned hundreds of thousands of them into refugees; for Israel, it was triumph in a war of independence in the face of a full-scale assault against its Jewish people. Both communities saw the events in very different ways. From an Israeli perspective, the Arabs were hell-bent on destroying Israel in 1948, and the war they provoked ended up making thousands of Palestinian people refugees. From a Palestinian viewpoint, the Israelis were acting on a plan to expel them and thus ethnically cleanse the country. Israel did expel Palestinians, but others simply left as their society collapsed under the pressure of war; even so, more than 100,000 Palestinians remained inside Israel after 1949. Massacre was followed by counter-massacre: Jewish forces killed around 100 Palestinian villagers at Deir Yassin, just west of Jerusalem, in April 1948; shortly afterwards, Arab fighters killed some 80 Jewish medical staff near Jerusalem. These massacres reveal how both sides emphasise different historical events, and in different ways. Indeed, histories of this period quickly reveal how divisive this time remains, with accounts often skewed significantly toward one side or another. The conclusion of the First Arab-Israeli War left two significant political problems, both of which remain largely unresolved today. First, more than 700,000 Palestinians now lived in refugee camps in the Egyptian-run Gaza Strip, throughout neighbouring Arab nations, and in the Jordanian-controlled West Bank. Stateless, without passports and dispossessed, theirs was a squalid existence, and no one addressed their lack of political rights. Meanwhile, Israel built a functioning Jewish state, drawing in more Mizrahi Jews who had lived for centuries in Arab countries but who were no longer welcome there. But though the Zionists had realised their ambition of a Jewish state, no Arab states recognised it, meaning that Israel was flanked by hostile neighbours. The consequences of the failure to settle the political needs of both communities were to feed directly into the wars that were to come. Further Arab-Israeli wars 1956 73 Depending on your viewpoint, the causes of the Arab-Israeli wars that followed Israel s formation lie either with an aggressive expansionist Israeli state that preferred war to diplomacy, or with an intransigent Arab front that refused to talk to Israel, wanting instead to eliminate the Jewish state. The Palestinian people were caught in the middle. Israel escalated border tensions in the early 1950s. This led in 1956 to what became known as the Suez Crisis   an invasion by Israeli, British and French forces of Egypt under its dynamic new pan-Arab leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Israelis considered that Nasser started the war by launching attacks into Israel and blockading the port of Eilat, but the war s origins are contested. Israel won the conflict militarily but there was no political resolution, and another war followed little more than a decade later. US president Jimmy Carter witnesses an Arab-Israeli peace treaty in March 1979, flanked by the signatories, Egypt's president Anwar Sadat (left) and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin (Wally McNamee/Getty Images) The conflagration of June 1967 had major consequences. Across six days of fighting, Israeli forces destroyed the armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria, and occupied vast new tracts of land in the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank and Golan Heights. Israeli paratroopers also took east Jerusalem, which included the Old City, home to holy sites such as the Jewish Western Wall and the area known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount. Read more about the Six-Day war This was a stunning military success for Israel, but the 1967 war also led to political change. A messianic, less secular, settler-based Zionism grew in the recently conquered West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan. These settlers formed Gush Emunim ( Bloc of the Faithful ) in 1974 as an orthodox activist organisation to reflect the new mood in Zionism, while Israel s Jews divided into the more secular versus the more religious. Meanwhile, humiliated, the Arabs refused to accept their defeat. The result was yet another conflict: the Yom Kippur War in 1973, named for the Jewish holy day of atonement, on which Egyptian and Syrian forces attacked. Though this war proved more successful for the Arabs in its initial phases, the Israelis successfully counter-attacked. The conflict led Israel and Egypt to sign a peace treaty in 1979. Despite a historic visit to Israel by the Egyptian leader, Anwar Sadat, the issues underpinning the conflict had still not been fundamentally resolved. The Palestinians remained without a state, and their war went on. Indeed, after the peace with Egypt, Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to attack Palestinian fighters based there. They remained in southern Lebanon, finally pulling out in 2000 when faced with a new foe in the shape of Lebanese Muslim Shia militia forces such as Hezbollah. Read more | What was Golda Meir's role in the Yom Kippur War Stalemate and resolution 1987 96 The lack of any wider political progress had provoked simmering anger among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza territory occupied by Israel in 1967. In 1987, this finally erupted into a full-scale uprising in Gaza   the intifada   which soon spread to the West Bank. Mass riots saw people, including children, throwing stones at Israeli troops and tanks. Soldiers responded with physical violence, some aimed at the children, and with lethal force. The resulting images, beamed around the world, were terrible PR for the Israelis. Israel s military power was not so effective against unarmed demonstrators as it was against conventional armies. The asymmetric battle between hi-tech weapons and stone-throwers revealed that the side that seemingly holds more power does not always get what it wants. This helped to push the two sides to talk, and Yasser Arafat for the Palestinians and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin eventually forged a deal   of sorts. Young Palestinians flee Israeli soldiers during riots in Gaza City in 1993. The violence of the Palestinian intifada (uprising) eased briefly when the Oslo Peace Accords were signed in September 1993 (PATRICK BAZ/Getty Images) In 1993, the two sides signed a deal that was marked, historically, by Arafat shaking hands with Rabin on the lawn of the White House in Washington DC in front of the US president. It was a significant moment for Rabin who, for many years, had seen Arafat as an implacable terrorist foe. The window of peace opened briefly, and then closed. One view of why talks failed is that the Israelis were unwilling to trade land for peace; another is that the Palestinians, preferring war to peace, were unwilling to accept any realistic deal offered to them. Whichever perspective is correct, the inchoate negotiations shuddered to a halt in 1995 when a religious Israeli extremist, angry at Rabin s peace moves, shot him dead in Tel Aviv. Chaos followed. Extremists on both sides, opposed to any peace deal that would involve some degree of compromise, took charge. Palestinian suicide bombers blew up Israelis on buses and in marketplaces. In 1996, a rightwing government led by Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in Israel, aiming to block the political changes made by Rabin. Critics argue that Netanyahu, who is in power again today, has worked assiduously to smash any political dialogue that would lead to Israel giving up land for a lasting political settlement, preferring instead stagnant talks and the offer of patchy autonomous areas of control to the Palestinians. Netanyahu s supporters see his policies as the natural result of Palestinian unwillingness to forge a compromise deal and accept Israel s right to exist. The continuing conundrum 1996 present The lack of political dialogue has led to further conflict. Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians after 1996, and the launch of a second intifada in 2000, led to Israel retaliating with the construction of a huge  separation  wall to stop suicide bombers and blockade the West Bank, while simultaneously building new settlements on land taken in 1967. A withdrawal of Israeli settlements from Gaza in 2005 came shortly before a split within the Palestinians between the Islamist Hamas movement based in Gaza and, on the West Bank, Palestine Liberation Organization-led secular political groups centred around the nationalist party Fatah. The internal divisions within the Palestinian camp that caused this split made it hard to present a unified front in any negotiations with Israel. This made a peace deal problematic because there were now two Palestinian camps   one of which, Hamas, had Israel s destruction explicitly written into its charter.

The relocation of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv angered Palestinians (MENAHEM KAHANA/Getty Images) Many Israelis were convinced that the Palestinians were not serious about peace. Israeli invasions of Lebanon provoked another conflict with Lebanon s Hezbollah (backed by Iran), which attacked Israel in 2006. In 2014, Israel launched large-scale attacks into Gaza in response to rocket fire from Hamas militants. The conflict rumbles on. Despite ongoing efforts to find a resolution, it still takes a determined optimist to see much future for a two-state solution in which the Israeli and Palestinian states coexist alongside each other. Similarly, a binational solution resulting in a single Israeli-Palestinian state as a home for all communities also seems unlikely.
