These cards and card trimmer belonged to Harry Houdini, a lifelong collector of effects, props, and locking devices that he learned how to pick. Alamy/Cordon Press His desire for success grew stronger when his father fell sick. In 1883 Ehrich set up an improvised circus along with boys from his neighborhood and performed as a trapeze artist. In a glimpse of his future flair for self-styling, the nine-year-old crowned himself Prince of the Air. Having tried and failed to work as a rabbi, Ehrich s father moved the Weisses to a New York slum. The young boy s early love for illusionism and tricks offered the chance of freedom from the fate that awaited so many young immigrants at that time: the lifelong drudgery of the garment trade. As if in preparation for the feats ahead, the stocky Ehrich trained by lifting weights, swimming, and boxing while taking on a variety of manual-labor jobs to make ends meet. A friend introduced Ehrich to the memoirs of 19th-century French magician Jean-Eug ne Robert-Houdin, considered the father of modern conjuring. In the 1890s, Ehrich added an i to Houdin to make his new last name, and his career, \"like Houdin.\" He also gave himself a new first name in homage to American magician Harry Kellar. Under this stage name, Harry Houdini set up a traveling circus with his younger brother, whose stage name was Theodore  Dash  Hardeen. The brothers featured high-wire acts, snake charmers, and belly dancers. The duo reached their long-sought acclaim with what became their signature act, Metamorphosis, first performed at the 1893 Chicago World s Fair. Dash tied Houdini up and put him in a sack, which was placed inside a chest. Once the curtain was pulled, Dash was revealed to have replaced Houdini, the speed of which astonished the crowds. Unrestrained One of Houdini's most iconic stunts was his straitjacket escape. First performed in Kansas City in 1915 in front of thousands, and always staged near newspaper offices, it involved Houdini dangling from a crane by his feet. Wriggling himself free from the straitjacket, shown here, he then spread his arms wide to the frenzy of the crowd. Bridgeman/ACI Within a year, Dash was superseded by young singer and dancer Wilhelmina Beatrice Rahner, or Bess, who Houdini had married within three weeks of meeting and made his new partner in magic. They went by the Houdinis, and Bess became his stage assistant for the rest of his life. Although their performances, also consisting of traditional magic tricks, were popular, earnings were scant. Houdini knew he had to maximize the sensationalism to pull in the crowds. The handcuff king Experience as an apprentice locksmith gave Houdini the founding idea of his career. Arriving in a town, he d alert the press. He would then call a police station and ask to be handcuffed and locked in a cell. Within minutes, he d walk free. Harry Houdini moments before being lowered into his water torture cell in 1913. Bridgeman/ACI The media coverage from these stunts helped promote the Houdinis  shows. In 1899 entrepreneur Martin Beck offered Houdini a contract to perform in his theaters. Houdini now had a substantial income, and new horizons suddenly opened. He was performing in Britain in 1900 and Russia in 1903. His popularity led to an avalanche of copycats and doubters, forcing him to push his limits and defend his name, even winning a lawsuit in 1902 against a German newspaper that called him a fraud. Starting in 1908, his signature act was being locked in a milk can full of water. In 1912 he replaced the milk can with the water torture cell, where he was bound in chains and padlocks and submerged upside down. Public fascination with his daredevilry won Houdini star roles in early cinema. The plot of the 1919 movie The Grim Game centers on an escapologist played by Houdini. Public fascination with his daredevilry won Houdini star roles in early cinema, like the 1919 movie The Grim Game, shown in this poster. Alamy/ACI The shadow of death  My chief task is to conquer fear,  Houdini said of his acts. He made himself undergo  tortuous self-training  to avoid panic. Biographers have wondered what drove Houdini to such extreme acts. Some suggest it was to resolve the trauma of being a poor outsider. A target of anti-Semitic insults, Houdini seemed to have aligned himself with the emerging idea of the muscular Jew to counter the prevalent stereotype that Jewish men were physically weak. (Harry Houdini s unlikely last act? Taking on the occult.) Houdini was fiercely critical of spiritualism, a hugely popular practice at the time. He regarded it as fraudulent. One reading of his career is as extreme rationalism in the face of death. Yet for a man always prepared to die, the nature of his demise took his admirers, and the country, by surprise. During the height of his career, in October 1926, Houdini was in Montr al to perform at McGill University. A student asked about his abdominal strength and whether he could withstand punches. When Houdini replied he could, the student punched him in the stomach. Houdini seemed to have been unprepared for the blow, which caused him a great deal of pain. Days later, on October 31, 1926, he died in Detroit at age 52. The cause of death was peritonitis, caused by appendicitis. French poster of the 1918 movie The Master Mystery, starring Harry Houdini. Alamy/Cordon Press Debate continues to rage over whether the punch had indeed been fatal, or if Houdini succumbed to an unrelated intestinal condition caused by his ruptured appendix. In his will, he left his effects and props to Dash, requesting they be burned upon Dash s death.",

        "content": "Juan, on the other hand, was adored by the pope. At the request of the Catholic Monarchs, Juan was sent to Spain to be invested as Duke of Gandi a and to seal the marriage arranged for him with Ferdinand II s cousin. Alexander prepared an even more splendid future for Juan on Italian soil. He showered him with titles, honors, territories, and wealth. And Juan, though he didn t always follow his father s advice, knew how to talk him round. But in 1497, when Juan returned to Rome, disaster struck. He was stabbed to death by unknown assassins and thrown into the Tiber River. Alexander s desolation was absolute:  If we had seven papacies, we would give them all to restore him to life,  he declared, weeping before the consistory. Who murdered the Duke of Gand a? A 16th-century portrait of a man believed to be Juan Borgia. Sergio Anelli/Mondadori/Album What befell the pope s son on a summer s night in 1497 is an enduring Renaissance murder mystery. Three years before, Juan Borgia s father sent him to Spain, where it was hoped Juan would use the influence of his wife, a cousin of King Ferdinand II s, to further Borgia fortunes in Spain and Aragon  controlled Naples. A pleasure -seeker, Juan returned to Rome at his father s request following the French invasion of Italy in 1496. He was appointed the Vatican s military commander to seize the rival Orsini s lands as punish ment for their siding with the French. In June 1497, at the age of 21, Juan disappeared. His body was later pulled from the Tiber River covered in stab wounds, but his purse was intact. This was no com mon robbery. Had the Orsinis done the deed? Or was this the revenge of his rumor -spreading brother- in- law Giovanni Sforza, whose mar riage to Juan s sister Lucrezia had just been annulled? As cardinal, Cesare from the beginning offered the pope firm support in affairs of both Church and state. An ambassador Gianandrea Boccaccio wrote of Cesare,  He is a man of great talent and of an excellent nature; his manners are those of the son of a great prince...  Perhaps his father saw in him the potential for a third Borgia pope. In any case, Alexander did not immediately give in to Cesare s repeated requests that he be allowed to abandon his own ecclesiastical career, for which Cesare claimed he felt no vocation. The pope only accepted Cesare s resignation as cardinal a year after Juan s death. Cesare recognized his father as a great master in the art of politics and the changing alliances that characterized the time. They had several shared objectives, but Cesare was aware that given his father s age and failing health, time was running out. As commander of the papal army, Cesare conquered cities in an attempt to carve out a Borgia state. Even his allies despised his growing power, and after his father s passing, Cesare struggled to maintain control without papal support. (He was a Founding Father. His son sided with the British.) Luxury apartments In the Room of the Saints, Pinturicchio paints this scene of court life, with a multitude of lavishly dressed figures, in the style of portraiture. Among those depicted is the architect Giuliano da Sangallo carrying a compass, in reference to the work he had undertaken for Pope Alexander VI at Rome s Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. At his side is Pinturicchio himself. A monumental triumphal arch, inspired by the Arch of Constantine in Rome, dominates the composition. It is topped by a statue of a bull, the heraldic symbol of Alexander VI. The inscription pacis cultori ( he who loves peace ) also refers to the pope. Below the arch, St. Catherine of Alexandria has a strong resemblance to the pope s daughter Lucrezia Borgia, who was in her mid- teens when the scene was painted. Finally, the model for the man wearing the white turban, to the far right, could be Djem, the brother and rival of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II. Djem had been a prisoner of the French and used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Ottomans, passing into the custody of Pope Alexander VI s predecessor, Pope Innocent VIII, in 1489. Alexander agreed to hold Djem hostage if the Ottomans left Europe. Djem became a friend of Cesare Borgia. Oronoz/Album The Borgia Apartment at the Vatican was created during the papacy of Alexander VI (r. 1492 1503). Its rooms were painted by Pinturicchio ( The little painter ), ne  Bernardino di Betto. The Room of the Sibyls and the Room of the Creed are in the Borgia Tower. Adjoining these are the Room of Liberal Arts; the Room of Mysteries, depicting Pope Alexander VI kneeling at the feet of the resurrected Christ; and the Room of the Saints, shown here. Likely used as the pope s private study, the room is dedicated to seven saints, with numerous visual references to Pope Alexander VI and the Borgias. The scene here depicts the Disputation of St. Catherine of Alex andria. Refusing to make sacrifices to pagan gods, Catherine, a young Christian woman (center), defeats 50 scholars in a religious dispute. Although the governor of Egypt (enthroned), is impressed by her reasoning, he nevertheless orders Cath erine to be put to death. Several figures in the painting are likenesses of people from Alexander VI s circle, including some of his own children. Lucrezia, the most favored Among all his children, the pope most favored Lucrezia, the jewel of the family, for her beauty, sweet nature, and refinement. There was a strong bond of affection between father and daughter. Lucrezia s first husband was Giovanni Sforza, a relative of the Duke of Milan. That marriage failed on not only a personal level but also a political one. The marriage ended in annulment, and for Lucrezia there was a bitter epilogue. Sforza insinuated that she had engaged in an incestuous relationship with her father. Rumors spread to implicate her brothers too. Although the claim was refuted time and again, it still lingered. The black legend of the Borgias Milan s Castello Sforzesco was the residence of the Sforza dukes of Milan. Lucrezia Borgia s first husband, Giovanni Sforza, was from a parallel line of the Sforza family. Buena Vista Images/Getty Images The great Italian families were accustomed to holding the papacy and railed against the  intru sion  of the Borgias, whom they saw as outsiders. Two years after Rodrigo s accession to the papacy, France and Spain invaded Italy. Blaming the native of Valencia, Spain, for this aggression was a way for the pope s rivals to undermine his authority. Many accusations were pure invention, including the claim that he used poison to gain the papacy. The Borgias could certainly be ruthless in their quest for power, but this ferocity was normal for the Renaissance and exaggerated by their enemies. The most scandal ous defamation incest between daughter Lucrezia and her father or her brothers was propagated by Lucrezia s first husband, Giovanni Sforza, following the pope s annulment of their marriage. The arrival of a mystery baby at the Borgia household fueled the rumors. The child s parentage was veiled in secrecy. Legitimized as the son of Cesare and then, in a secret bull, as the offspring of the pope himself, the child could have been a natural son of Lucrezia s. Perhaps the family wanted to protect her by integrating the child with the Borgia surname. Despite their familial affection, Lucrezia soon discovered that her father had as much capacity to hurt her as he had to love her, and it would be impossible to find peace so long as he could interfere in her life. So, after the murder of her second husband, Alfonso of Aragon, she married for a third time, to Alfonso d Este, heir to the duchies of Ferrara, Modena, and Reggio. This allowed her to move far from Rome. Aware of her reasons for leaving, and of the union s convenience for the entire family, her father accepted the separation. Of the pope s regard for his daughter, the Duke of Ferrara s secretary remarked,  His Holiness loves her more than any other person of his blood.  (While Napoleon conquered nations, his sister conquered hearts.) Husband and wife Around 1510, Bartolomeo Veneto painted this portrait of Beatrice d Este, a pious 13th  century ancestor of Alfonso d Este, Duke of Ferrara, who was Lucrezia s third husband, shown in the second portrait. Art historians still debate whether Veneto used the likeness of Lucrezia for this and at least one other of his portraits. Snite Museum of Art, University of Notre Dame (Top) (Left) and DEA/Album (Bottom) (Right) Sibling rivalries Wherever the Borgia-Cattanei met, laughter, gallantry, wit, and music abounded. But it wasn t all smooth sailing. Some of the natural squabbles among siblings hardened into bitterness. Lucrezia was, in a way, the one who held them together. Goffredo was particularly close to Lucrezia: They went everywhere together, and she was protective of him. They grew even closer when Lucrezia married Alfonso of Aragon, the brother of Goffredo s wife, Sancha. Lucrezia and Sancha were great friends and neither the failure of Sancha and Goffredo s marriage nor the death of Alfonso broke the bond of friendship between the two sisters-in-law. It was Goffredo who protected Lucrezia and Alfonso s two-year-old son, Rodrigo, during the violent acts unleashed in Rome after the death of the pope. Little Rodrigo s father, Alfonso of Aragon, was already dead by this point. As Duchess of Ferrara, Lucrezia Borgia gave a lock of her hair to the humanist and cardinal Pietro Bembo, with whom she kept a close friendship. Marco Ansaloni But the brother for whom Lucrezia had the most affinity was Juan. Between Juan and Cesare, however, the relationship was strained. Alexander had maneuvered for Juan to receive all sorts of titles and territories, believing that this was in the best interest of the wider family. Meanwhile, Cesare, despite outshining his brother intellectually, had been forced to follow an ecclesiastical path that he hated. Perhaps Cesare considered himself more qualified than his brother to become a great prince. That perception was emphasized when Juan returned to Rome and demonstrated mediocre skills on the battlefield. Though Cesare lacked Juan s titles, his influence in the political and ecclesiastical realms went beyond that of the duke s power. In fact, as the pope s cardinal legate, Cesare was preparing to crown the new king of Naples, Frederick II. It was a level of authority that was difficult to surpass. Malicious rumors circulated that both Cesare and Juan were vying for their sister-in-law, Sancha of Aragon. It is impossible to know whether or not there was any truth to the gossip. Juan did have a reputation for being a womanizer, but the story could also have been an invention of the so-called black legend. The later accusations that Cesare murdered Juan because of sexual jealousy over Sancha are also hard to prove. Such gossip, however, worked to obscure an obvious political motive for the crime. Juan had achieved enormous power on Italian soil, and his death dealt a severe blow to the power of the House the Borgia in Italy and the kingdom of Valencia. Juan s heir was not yet three years old, showing the vulnerability of the pontiff.",

        "content": "Heavy is the head that wears the crown,  wrote William Shakespeare. For three young women in the early 1300s, being the daughters-in-law of a king could be just as burdensome, especially when the sovereign was the ruthless Philip IV of France. Like many kings before him, Philip IV was focused on the question of his succession. His dynasty, the Capets, had ruled France since the 900s, and to ensure its survival, Philip made strategic marriages for his children to secure alliances and heirs. His three sons married French noblewomen, and his daughter, Isabella, wed King Edward II of England. But all his plans would come undone in 1314, when his children and their spouses were engulfed by the Nesle Tower affair. The scandal not only led to torture, imprisonment, and the possible murder of one of the princesses; it also led to a succession crisis in France that sparked the ruinous Hundred Years  War. (How Joan of Arc turned the tide in the Hundred Years  War.) Illicit affairs The wives of all three of King Philip s adult sons hailed from the neighboring region of Burgundy. Louis (the future Louis X) married Margaret, daughter of the Duke of Burgundy. Philip (the future Philip V) married Joan, daughter of the Count of Burgundy. Finally, Charles, (the future Charles IV) married Joan s sister, Blanche of Burgundy. Anxious to secure the Capetian dynasty, Philip IV (at center in a 14th-century miniature) married his sons to Burgundian noblewomen. Oronoz/Album Only one of these marriages is recorded as being happy. Even by the standards of dynastic marriage, Margaret s union with Louis was cold. Charles was overbearing with Blanche. Only Joan appeared to have been happily married to Philip, a bond that would later spare her from the miserable fates of her sisters-in-law. The scandal began in 1313 when Isabella, King Philip s daughter, visited Paris with her infant son, the future Edward III of England. Several chronicles describe a puppet show at which Isabella gave embroidered silk purses to her three sisters-in-law, Margaret, Blanche, and Joan. (Twists of fate made Nagasaki a target 75 years ago) On a later visit home, Isabella noticed that two knights accompanying her sisters-in-law brothers Philippe and Gautier d Aunay were wearing those gifted purses on their belts. It is said Isabella saw these purses as a sign of an illicit liaison between the knights and her sisters-in-law, and she alerted her father in 1314. On their own, the purses were unlikely to have been enough proof of adultery. Although during the Middle Ages, when women gave such presents to knights as favors, it was a practice often seen as a display of affection. But the king would need stronger evidence than that.",

        "title": "Was Nero really a monster?",
        "content": "Popular with the plebs This marble bust of Nero was carved around A.D. 60, when the ruler, in his early 20s, still enjoyed public support. Now in the Capitoline Museums, it was restored in the 17th century. Alamy/ACI By the age of 20, Nero had already forged his own political style and instituted judicial and fiscal reforms benefiting the common people (plebeians). But his political vision was hampered by his mother Agrippina, who, after getting rid of all her rivals, threatened to remove her son from power. The first time that Agrippina was accused of plotting a coup d e tat against her son, in A.D. 55, Nero showed clemency. Agrippina had allied herself with Nero s rival Rubellius Plautus (the great-grandson of Emperor Tiberius). Nero forgave his mother and her accomplice, and he exiled others involved in the plot. However, when Agrippina again took action against her son three years later, one of Nero s advisers encouraged him to have her killed while making it look like an accident at sea. According to Tacitus, it was the freedman Anicetus who dreamed up the boat plot, but senator and historian Cassius Dio wrote that Seneca and Nero came up with the idea together. Either way, Nero gave orders to scupper the ship his mother was sailing on off the coast of Naples. Miraculously, Agrippina survived the shipwreck. Then, on March 23, A.D. 59, she was finally assassinated by Nero s henchmen at her villa in Bauli. It s said that a well-known comic actor made a daring allusion in song to the murder. He sang:  Farewell to thee, father; farewell to thee, mother,  while doing a mime of eating and swimming. Claudius had been poisoned while eating dinner, and Agrippina had narrowly escaped being drowned. The likeness of Nero s wife Octavia appears on a coin minted around A.D. 56 57. Nero banished Octavia to the remote Mediterranean island of Pandataria, where he had her killed. Bridgeman/ACI Despite these lurid events, which overshadowed Nero s reign and detracted from his general policy of clemency, Nero retained considerable popularity by providing the people with bread and circuses. But the support of the common people began to wane when Poppaea Sabina, a beautiful Pompeian woman, appeared on the scene. In A.D. 62, when Poppaea became pregnant several months into an adulterous relationship with Nero, the emperor decided to divorce his wife Octavia and marry Poppaea. To justify these actions, Nero accused Octavia of adultery with an enslaved person and exiled her to Campania, on the southwest coast. Outraged, the people began to destroy the public images of Poppaea in solidarity with the exiled empress. The revolt forced Nero to bring Octavia back to Rome, but he was now determined to sentence her to death. After facing a second false accusation of adultery, this time with Nero s former accomplice Anicetus, the commander of the Misenum fleet, Octavia was sent to the island of Pandataria. There, some of the emperor s assassins murdered her by slashing her veins and immersing her in boiling water. A 16th-century painting of Poppaea Sabina, second wife of Nero. Bridgeman/ACI The animosity the Roman people showed toward Poppaea wasn t shared in other parts of the empire. In the Campania region, where Poppaea was born in the city of Pompeii, the imperial couple enjoyed popular support. On the walls of Pompeian houses (destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79) archaeologists uncovered graffiti reading  Hail Nero,   Long Live Poppaea,  and  Hurray for the Emperor and Empress.  (Pompeii still has many secrets to uncover but should we keep digging?) In fact, there was more Pompeian graffiti in favor of Nero than for any previous emperor, and the messages remained visible even after Nero had been sentenced to damnatio memoriae, the removal of all his public and private images and inscriptions after his death. Nero s special popularity in Pompeii can be explained not only by Poppaea s Pompeian origin but also by the favors that Nero granted the city. He contributed to Pompeii s recovery after an earthquake devastated it in A.D. 62, and he visited in person to make offerings at the temple of Venus. Nero also gained popularity by allowing Pompeians to return to their amphitheater early. Octavia's gruesome murder One of the episodes that most damaged Nero s reputation was the murder of his first wife, Claudia Octavia. DEA/Album According to the account by Tacitus in the second century, Poppaea Sabina, Nero s lover, drove the murder of his wife Octavia, convincing Nero that divorcing his wife to marry her would not be enough. As the daughter of Emperor Claudius, Octavia was popular with the masses, which made her a threat to both Nero and his new wife. Octavia, therefore, also needed to be discredited and eliminated. To achieve this, Nero falsely accused Octavia of committing adultery with the prefect Anicetus, whom he persuaded to  confess  to the affair. She was also accused of aborting a child she had conceived with Anicetus, a practice that was not illegal but was disapproved of. As punishment, Tacitus writes, Nero confined her to the island of Pandataria (modern day Ventotene), off the west coast of Italy: No exile ever filled the eyes of beholders with tears of greater compassion . . . After a few days, she received an order that she was to die . . . She was then tightly bound with cords, and the veins of every limb were opened; but as her blood was congealed by terror and flowed too slowly, she was killed outright by the steam of an intensely hot bath. To this was added the yet more appalling horror of Poppaea beholding the severed head which was conveyed to Rome. The oil painting  Revenge of Poppea  by the 19th  century Italian artist Giovanni Muzzioli depicts the moment that Poppaea gloats over the severed head of Octavia, presented to her on a plat er. Nero s new wife reclines on a couch, leaning against the emperor, who appears markedly indifferent to the gruesome sight of his ex wife s disembodied head. By contrast, two senators to his right are visibly shocked. The clothing, furniture, and art that decorate the walls in this painting were carefully designed by the artist to depict Rome in the A.D. 60s It is now displayed in the Civic Museum of Modena, Italy. Their games had been banned for 10 years, as punishment for a brawl that had broken out in the crowd at a gladiatorial contest when locals clashed violently with spectators from neighboring Nuceria. To cement the loyalty of the Pompeians, Nero reopened it after just five years. In this contemporary photo, the volcano of Vesuvius looms beyond a street in the ancient city of Pompeii. Inscriptions celebrating Nero and his wife Poppaea Sabina were found on walls at the site. Vittorio Sciosia/Fototeca 9x12 Not unique The violence of Nero s reign, as depicted by the ancient biographers, intensified in the A.D. 60s. Ongoing conflict between the Senate and the emperor fueled conspiracies, and Nero ramped up surveillance. Ofonius Tigellinus, prefect of the Praetorian Guard in A.D. 62, led an effective team of spies, who rooted out alleged conspirators. Accused of defaming Nero, the most dangerous rivals of the emperor met untimely deaths: Rubellius Plautus, Faustus Cornelius Sulla, Gaius Calpurnius Piso, Seneca, and many of their co-conspirators.",

        "title": "Was Caligula mad or just misunderstood?",
        "content": "Right up until the end, Caligula made rational decisions,  says Barrett, comparing him more to a Joseph Stalin as opposed to a deranged Hitler figure.  He could distinguish reality from fantasy.  But the monarch s reality was one suffused in total power a privilege he wielded strategically and at will. That power would have gone to anyone s head.  When he entered the city, full and absolute power was at once put into his hands by the unanimous consent of the senate and the mob,  claimed Suetonius, a historian known for his biographies of the Caesars. From the first, though, Caligula s imperial might was bathed in blood of thousands of animal sacrifices.  So great was the public rejoicing,  said Suetonius,  that within the next three months more than a hundred and sixty thousand victims are said to have been slain in sacrifice.  Trustworthy sources? Despite those excesses, says Barrett, it s important to question the accounts of Caligula s contemporaries. Their work was informed by his political enemies and distorted by hearsay. The most trustworthy chronicler of his day, Tacitus, did write about Caligula, but unfortunately his work has been lost. The histories that remained contain  ridiculous and absurd  accounts of the emperor, says Barrett, who compares Suetonius and his contemporary, Cassius Dio, to tabloid reporters in search of a scoop on the embattled emperor. Caligula s behavior was definitely cruel but likely a little less juicy than Dio and Suetonius would have you believe. Take Caligula s widely reported demands to be treated like a god. That would have been standard practice in Roman colonies, which were forced to recognize the so-called  imperial cult  of Rome. But Barrett says there is no evidence like coinage that would support a similar demand within Rome or even Italy. Then there s the infamous tale of making his horse a consul a threat that never came to fruition. Barrett attributes that episode to an annoyed emperor mocking his enemies in the senate enemies he considered so incompetent and feckless, they could easily be replaced by an animal. Besides a stall of marble, a manger of ivory, purple blankets and a collar of precious stones, [Caligula] even gave this horse [Incitatus] a house, a troop of slaves and furniture ... and it is also said that he planned to make him consul. Suetonius , Lives of the Caesars Bad reputation? But even if Caligula never engaged in the most outrageous exploits attributed to him, the fact of his outsized and extremely long-lasting reputation remains. What accounts for the ongoing notoriety of a man whose rule lasted less than four years nearly two millennia ago?  Humans love villains,  says Barrett, and Caligula enjoys ongoing fame thanks to a combination of personal charisma and stubborn enmity among his contemporaries. There s another factor, says Barrett: The passage of time. Because so many years have passed since his exploits, Barrett says,  Caligula belongs to a world that is so alien to us now that we can enjoy his villainy with a clear conscience.",

He turned to Numidia, a North African ally whose ruler, Micipsa, was glad to provide Numidian soldiers. A loyal ally of Rome in its recent victory over Carthage, Numidia (located in parts of modern Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya) had an underlying motive for helping Rome: Micipsa could send his nephew Jugurtha to command Numidia s forces. Charismatic, clever, and aggressive, Jugurtha represented a threat to Micipsa s throne and his two sons. Assisting Rome in Spain would conveniently put Jugurtha in harm s way. Perhaps he would never return. Numidian coin bearing the image of Jugurtha. National Library, Paris AKG/ALBUM But Jugurtha did return after a decisive Roman victory at Numantia with a glowing letter of recommendation from Scipio. His military and political reputation enhanced, Jugurtha had also established valuable Roman connections. To diminish his threat to the throne, King Micipsa decided to adopt his nephew and include him in a three-way split of the kingdom with his biological sons, Hiempsal and Adherbal. Jugurtha s ambition was undeniable, and he would not be content to co-rule with his adoptive brothers. Most of what is known about Jugurtha s life comes from two Roman historians: Sallust and Plutarch, who recorded how he employed bribery, treachery, and murder in ruthless pursuit of sole control of Numidia.

His land prospered, and following Rome s destruction of Carthage in 146 B.C., Masinissa s son, Micipsa, continued ruling as a Roman ally.

For three young women in the early 1300s, being the daughters-in-law of a king could be just as burdensome, especially when the sovereign was the ruthless Philip IV of France. Like many kings before him, Philip IV was focused on the question of his succession. His dynasty, the Capets, had ruled France since the 900s, and to ensure its survival, Philip made strategic marriages for his children to secure alliances and heirs. His three sons married French noblewomen, and his daughter, Isabella, wed King Edward II of England. But all his plans would come undone in 1314, when his children and their spouses were engulfed by the Nesle Tower affair. The scandal not only led to torture, imprisonment, and the possible murder of one of the princesses; it also led to a succession crisis in France that sparked the ruinous Hundred Years  War. (How Joan of Arc turned the tide in the Hundred Years  War.) Illicit affairs The wives of all three of King Philip s adult sons hailed from the neighboring region of Burgundy. Louis (the future Louis X) married Margaret, daughter of the Duke of Burgundy. Philip (the future Philip V) married Joan, daughter of the Count of Burgundy. Finally, Charles, (the future Charles IV) married Joan s sister, Blanche of Burgundy. Anxious to secure the Capetian dynasty, Philip IV (at center in a 14th-century miniature) married his sons to Burgundian noblewomen. Oronoz/Album Only one of these marriages is recorded as being happy. Even by the standards of dynastic marriage, Margaret s union with Louis was cold. Charles was overbearing with Blanche. Only Joan appeared to have been happily married to Philip, a bond that would later spare her from the miserable fates of her sisters-in-law. The scandal began in 1313 when Isabella, King Philip s daughter, visited Paris with her infant son, the future Edward III of England. Several chronicles describe a puppet show at which Isabella gave embroidered silk purses to her three sisters-in-law, Margaret, Blanche, and Joan. (Twists of fate made Nagasaki a target 75 years ago) On a later visit home, Isabella noticed that two knights accompanying her sisters-in-law brothers Philippe and Gautier d Aunay were wearing those gifted purses on their belts. It is said Isabella saw these purses as a sign of an illicit liaison between the knights and her sisters-in-law, and she alerted her father in 1314. On their own, the purses were unlikely to have been enough proof of adultery. Although during the Middle Ages, when women gave such presents to knights as favors, it was a practice often seen as a display of affection. But the king would need stronger evidence than that.",

        "content": "Juan, on the other hand, was adored by the pope. At the request of the Catholic Monarchs, Juan was sent to Spain to be invested as Duke of Gandi a and to seal the marriage arranged for him with Ferdinand II s cousin. Alexander prepared an even more splendid future for Juan on Italian soil. He showered him with titles, honors, territories, and wealth. And Juan, though he didn t always follow his father s advice, knew how to talk him round. But in 1497, when Juan returned to Rome, disaster struck. He was stabbed to death by unknown assassins and thrown into the Tiber River. Alexander s desolation was absolute:  If we had seven papacies, we would give them all to restore him to life,  he declared, weeping before the consistory. Who murdered the Duke of Gand a? A 16th-century portrait of a man believed to be Juan Borgia. Sergio Anelli/Mondadori/Album What befell the pope s son on a summer s night in 1497 is an enduring Renaissance murder mystery. Three years before, Juan Borgia s father sent him to Spain, where it was hoped Juan would use the influence of his wife, a cousin of King Ferdinand II s, to further Borgia fortunes in Spain and Aragon  controlled Naples. A pleasure -seeker, Juan returned to Rome at his father s request following the French invasion of Italy in 1496. He was appointed the Vatican s military commander to seize the rival Orsini s lands as punish ment for their siding with the French. In June 1497, at the age of 21, Juan disappeared. His body was later pulled from the Tiber River covered in stab wounds, but his purse was intact. This was no com mon robbery. Had the Orsinis done the deed? Or was this the revenge of his rumor -spreading brother- in- law Giovanni Sforza, whose mar riage to Juan s sister Lucrezia had just been annulled? As cardinal, Cesare from the beginning offered the pope firm support in affairs of both Church and state. An ambassador Gianandrea Boccaccio wrote of Cesare,  He is a man of great talent and of an excellent nature; his manners are those of the son of a great prince...  Perhaps his father saw in him the potential for a third Borgia pope. In any case, Alexander did not immediately give in to Cesare s repeated requests that he be allowed to abandon his own ecclesiastical career, for which Cesare claimed he felt no vocation. The pope only accepted Cesare s resignation as cardinal a year after Juan s death. Cesare recognized his father as a great master in the art of politics and the changing alliances that characterized the time. They had several shared objectives, but Cesare was aware that given his father s age and failing health, time was running out. As commander of the papal army, Cesare conquered cities in an attempt to carve out a Borgia state. Even his allies despised his growing power, and after his father s passing, Cesare struggled to maintain control without papal support. (He was a Founding Father. His son sided with the British.) Luxury apartments In the Room of the Saints, Pinturicchio paints this scene of court life, with a multitude of lavishly dressed figures, in the style of portraiture. Among those depicted is the architect Giuliano da Sangallo carrying a compass, in reference to the work he had undertaken for Pope Alexander VI at Rome s Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. At his side is Pinturicchio himself. A monumental triumphal arch, inspired by the Arch of Constantine in Rome, dominates the composition. It is topped by a statue of a bull, the heraldic symbol of Alexander VI. The inscription pacis cultori ( he who loves peace ) also refers to the pope. Below the arch, St. Catherine of Alexandria has a strong resemblance to the pope s daughter Lucrezia Borgia, who was in her mid- teens when the scene was painted. Finally, the model for the man wearing the white turban, to the far right, could be Djem, the brother and rival of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II. Djem had been a prisoner of the French and used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Ottomans, passing into the custody of Pope Alexander VI s predecessor, Pope Innocent VIII, in 1489. Alexander agreed to hold Djem hostage if the Ottomans left Europe. Djem became a friend of Cesare Borgia. Oronoz/Album The Borgia Apartment at the Vatican was created during the papacy of Alexander VI (r. 1492 1503). Its rooms were painted by Pinturicchio ( The little painter ), ne  Bernardino di Betto. The Room of the Sibyls and the Room of the Creed are in the Borgia Tower. Adjoining these are the Room of Liberal Arts; the Room of Mysteries, depicting Pope Alexander VI kneeling at the feet of the resurrected Christ; and the Room of the Saints, shown here. Likely used as the pope s private study, the room is dedicated to seven saints, with numerous visual references to Pope Alexander VI and the Borgias. The scene here depicts the Disputation of St. Catherine of Alex andria. Refusing to make sacrifices to pagan gods, Catherine, a young Christian woman (center), defeats 50 scholars in a religious dispute. Although the governor of Egypt (enthroned), is impressed by her reasoning, he nevertheless orders Cath erine to be put to death. Several figures in the painting are likenesses of people from Alexander VI s circle, including some of his own children. Lucrezia, the most favored Among all his children, the pope most favored Lucrezia, the jewel of the family, for her beauty, sweet nature, and refinement. There was a strong bond of affection between father and daughter. Lucrezia s first husband was Giovanni Sforza, a relative of the Duke of Milan. That marriage failed on not only a personal level but also a political one. The marriage ended in annulment, and for Lucrezia there was a bitter epilogue. Sforza insinuated that she had engaged in an incestuous relationship with her father. Rumors spread to implicate her brothers too. Although the claim was refuted time and again, it still lingered. The black legend of the Borgias Milan s Castello Sforzesco was the residence of the Sforza dukes of Milan. Lucrezia Borgia s first husband, Giovanni Sforza, was from a parallel line of the Sforza family. Buena Vista Images/Getty Images The great Italian families were accustomed to holding the papacy and railed against the  intru sion  of the Borgias, whom they saw as outsiders. Two years after Rodrigo s accession to the papacy, France and Spain invaded Italy. Blaming the native of Valencia, Spain, for this aggression was a way for the pope s rivals to undermine his authority. Many accusations were pure invention, including the claim that he used poison to gain the papacy. The Borgias could certainly be ruthless in their quest for power, but this ferocity was normal for the Renaissance and exaggerated by their enemies. The most scandal ous defamation incest between daughter Lucrezia and her father or her brothers was propagated by Lucrezia s first husband, Giovanni Sforza, following the pope s annulment of their marriage. The arrival of a mystery baby at the Borgia household fueled the rumors. The child s parentage was veiled in secrecy. Legitimized as the son of Cesare and then, in a secret bull, as the offspring of the pope himself, the child could have been a natural son of Lucrezia s. Perhaps the family wanted to protect her by integrating the child with the Borgia surname. Despite their familial affection, Lucrezia soon discovered that her father had as much capacity to hurt her as he had to love her, and it would be impossible to find peace so long as he could interfere in her life. So, after the murder of her second husband, Alfonso of Aragon, she married for a third time, to Alfonso d Este, heir to the duchies of Ferrara, Modena, and Reggio. This allowed her to move far from Rome. Aware of her reasons for leaving, and of the union s convenience for the entire family, her father accepted the separation. Of the pope s regard for his daughter, the Duke of Ferrara s secretary remarked,  His Holiness loves her more than any other person of his blood.  (While Napoleon conquered nations, his sister conquered hearts.) Husband and wife Around 1510, Bartolomeo Veneto painted this portrait of Beatrice d Este, a pious 13th  century ancestor of Alfonso d Este, Duke of Ferrara, who was Lucrezia s third husband, shown in the second portrait. Art historians still debate whether Veneto used the likeness of Lucrezia for this and at least one other of his portraits. Snite Museum of Art, University of Notre Dame (Top) (Left) and DEA/Album (Bottom) (Right) Sibling rivalries Wherever the Borgia-Cattanei met, laughter, gallantry, wit, and music abounded. But it wasn t all smooth sailing. Some of the natural squabbles among siblings hardened into bitterness. Lucrezia was, in a way, the one who held them together. Goffredo was particularly close to Lucrezia: They went everywhere together, and she was protective of him. They grew even closer when Lucrezia married Alfonso of Aragon, the brother of Goffredo s wife, Sancha. Lucrezia and Sancha were great friends and neither the failure of Sancha and Goffredo s marriage nor the death of Alfonso broke the bond of friendship between the two sisters-in-law. It was Goffredo who protected Lucrezia and Alfonso s two-year-old son, Rodrigo, during the violent acts unleashed in Rome after the death of the pope. Little Rodrigo s father, Alfonso of Aragon, was already dead by this point. As Duchess of Ferrara, Lucrezia Borgia gave a lock of her hair to the humanist and cardinal Pietro Bembo, with whom she kept a close friendship. Marco Ansaloni But the brother for whom Lucrezia had the most affinity was Juan. Between Juan and Cesare, however, the relationship was strained. Alexander had maneuvered for Juan to receive all sorts of titles and territories, believing that this was in the best interest of the wider family. Meanwhile, Cesare, despite outshining his brother intellectually, had been forced to follow an ecclesiastical path that he hated. Perhaps Cesare considered himself more qualified than his brother to become a great prince. That perception was emphasized when Juan returned to Rome and demonstrated mediocre skills on the battlefield. Though Cesare lacked Juan s titles, his influence in the political and ecclesiastical realms went beyond that of the duke s power. In fact, as the pope s cardinal legate, Cesare was preparing to crown the new king of Naples, Frederick II. It was a level of authority that was difficult to surpass. Malicious rumors circulated that both Cesare and Juan were vying for their sister-in-law, Sancha of Aragon. It is impossible to know whether or not there was any truth to the gossip. Juan did have a reputation for being a womanizer, but the story could also have been an invention of the so-called black legend. The later accusations that Cesare murdered Juan because of sexual jealousy over Sancha are also hard to prove. Such gossip, however, worked to obscure an obvious political motive for the crime. Juan had achieved enormous power on Italian soil, and his death dealt a severe blow to the power of the House the Borgia in Italy and the kingdom of Valencia. Juan s heir was not yet three years old, showing the vulnerability of the pontiff.",

        "content": "Next, Brier and Wade dehydrated the body using natron, a mineral of equal parts salt and baking soda that forms naturally in Egyptian wadis, or dry gullies. Like a sponge, natron sucks the moisture out of flesh, leaving it too dry to support bacteria, maggots, beetles, and other putrefying agents; the leftover tissue is essentially jerky. (Fully committed to authenticity, Brier dug the natron himself in Egypt, and recalls that sneaking hundreds of pounds of unidentified white powder through customs at JFK Airport was one of the more ticklish aspects of the project. Luckily, he was traveling with a film crew, and could hide the powder in suitcases amid their equipment.) In their lab, Brier and Wade placed the mummy s spleen, lungs, liver, and intestines into bowls and covered them with natron. They also packed 29 linen bags of the powder into the body s empty torso, laid the body on top of 211 more pounds, and dumped 583 additional pounds over it. They kept the body in Wade s old office, with the heat cranked up to 104 F and dehumidifiers running night and day to simulate Egyptian air. Bob Brier building the pallet that was used for the dehydration step of the mummification process. Pat Remler Natron, a naturally forming mineral made of salt and baking soda, was placed on the table before the body was set on top. Pat Remler The body was then covered with more natron and was left to dehydrate. Pat Remler Over the next five weeks, the natron on top turned crusty and brown from absorbing bodily juices, forcing Brier and Wade to crack through it with an iron rod. (Today Brier remembers the odor as acrid but not unpleasant, although news reports at the time say he and Wade donned surgical masks against the smell.) Regardless, the sight of the body beneath thrilled Brier. As it dries, the skin of mummies tightens and shrivels, especially on the face and scalp. The lips retract to reveal the teeth, and skin with less melanin turns brown- yellow. Brier always wondered whether those changes resulted from the immediate mummification process, or from several thousand years of weathering in Egypt s arid climate. One glance at his mummy and Brier knew the answer: even after five weeks,  he looked just like Ramses the Great,  he recalls, with leathery skin, a beaky nose, and wispy hair sticking up. The embalming process, not time, made the iconic mummies we know today. Beyond changing the body s appearance, the dehydration process left the limbs as stiff as tree branches, and dropped its weight from 188 pounds to just 79. (Thirty- one pounds of that represented the removal of organs.) The organs drying in the bowls withered as well, which helped explain another mystery of Egyptian mummification: as other archaeologists have noted, embalmers typically placed the organs in so called canopic jars, funerary vessels with slim necks so slim that it seemed impossible to fit the larger organs inside. But the natron shrunk them down enough to slip right in. (This is the earliest Egyptian embalming recipe.) After removing him from the natron, Brier and Wade gave Mr. Balm a full body massage with lotus, cedar, and palm oils, another step that, while important ritualistically, also had pragmatic benefits restoring flexibility to the joints, making the mummy easier to handle. This accomplished, they wrapped the body in linen bandages. (Embalmers in ancient times started with the hands and feet, wrapping each digit separately, then proceeded to the arms, legs, and torso. The penis was individually wrapped as well or, if embarrassingly shriveled, a cod piece of stiff linen was bound in place.) At this point, they let the mummy dry for three more months in the arid office, which dropped its weight to 51 pounds. Afterward, they added several more layers of wrappings. In between the layers, they slipped magic amulets and scraps of papyrus with spells on them, a common practice in ancient times.",

        "title": "Cleopatra, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony: how the last pharaoh's love affairs shaped Ancient Egypt's fate",
        "content": "Cleopatra was a daughter of Egypt   part of the Macedonian-Greek-Ptolemaic Dynasty that had ruled since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. Queen of Egypt, Cyrene and Cyprus, she was renowned for her passionate nature, beauty, intellect and determination to advance the interests of the Ptolemaic legacy. Ad They were masters of ancient Rome   powerful, ruthless military generals who had expanded the sphere of Roman influence, seizing power for themselves and seeking to add the vast Egyptian empire to Rome s ever-expanding list of conquests. The relationships between Cleopatra VII, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony were love affairs, and power struggles, that would change the course of Egyptian and Roman history, forever. Cleopatra and Caesar: how did their love affairs begin? It was Cleopatra s father, Ptolemy XII, who had effectively opened the door to the Romans. When Ptolemy XI was killed in 80 BC, his only male heirs were Ptolemy XII and his younger brother   the illegitimate sons of Ptolemy IX. Ptolemy XII was crowned in 76 BC but, soon after, the question of his legitimacy was raised in Rome, where anti-Senate politicians claimed to be in possession of a will, written by Ptolemy XI, that bequeathed Egypt to the Romans. Fearing the loss of the throne and an end to his dynasty, Ptolemy took a huge risk: he struck a deal with Rome. Read more | Your guide to the Roman Republic Desperate to retain his kingship, Ptolemy asked Caesar and Pompey to recognise him as Egypt s legal ruler and a comrade and ally of Rome. This they did, for the price of 6,000 talents   an enormous amount, of which some was borrowed from Roman moneylenders. When Rome moved in on the Egyptian territory of Cyprus the following year, Ptolemy did nothing. The Egyptian people were outraged, and banished their Pharaoh, leaving his wife and eldest daughter to rule in his stead. Ptolemy XII: Cleopatra's father from hell The tragic fate of Cleopatra has long overshadowed her predecessor, Ptolemy XII. But, as Diana T Nikolova explains, it s impossible to understand the daughter s downfall without exploring the father s hapless reign  Although Ptolemy was eventually restored to the throne, again with the help of the Roman Senate, the damage had been done. Egypt was weak, and Rome had its sights firmly set on conquest. To further compound matters, Ptolemy XII made the Roman Senate executor of his will (which proclaimed his eldest surviving daughter, Cleopatra, and eldest son co-regents), and his extensive bribery had left the realm in financial straits: Rome s foothold in Egypt looked sure to extend. In 51 BC, 18-year-old Cleopatra emerged onto the political scene as co-regent of Egypt with her younger brother and (in true Egyptian royal tradition) husband, ten-year-old Ptolemy XIII. Like her father before her, Cleopatra sought absolute power in Egypt, and soon set about dropping her brother s name from official documents. But, with Egypt facing economic failures, famine and crippling debt, Cleopatra realised she, too, needed the help of mighty Rome to lead Egypt back to peace and prosperity once more. Only this time, it would be on her terms. Cleopatra was not the only one harbouring a desire for sole control of Egypt. In 48 BC, encouraged by his court advisors, Ptolemy XIII banished Cleopatra from Alexandria and proclaimed himself sole ruler. An 18th-century depiction of Caesar meeting Cleopatra, by artist Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo. (Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) The battle lines had been drawn between the sibling spouses and Cleopatra, alone and powerless, hatched a plan to gain the ear of Caesar, who was merrily celebrating victory over his one-time comrade Pompey, at the battle of Pharsalus. As luck would have it, Caesar and his troops were already in Alexandria (he was in pursuit of his adversary Pompey who, having been defeated, was hoping for assistance from Ptolemy XIII). All Cleopatra had to do was enter Alexandria unseen and talk to Caesar before he reached his own agreement with her brother. It was an idea easier said than done. Fully prepared to seduce Caesar in order to enlist his help, Cleopatra planned to smuggle herself into Alexandria and inside the royal palace, where Caesar was staying as her brother s honoured guest. Greek historian Plutarch, writing more than a century later, described how Cleopatra achieved her mission:  [Cleopatra] embarked in a little skiff and landed at the palace when it was already getting dark; and as it was impossible to escape notice otherwise, she stretched herself at full length inside a bed-sack, while Apollodorus [her servant] tied the bed-sack up with a cord and carried it indoors to Caesar.

(Photo by Silver Screen Collection/ Getty Images) What did Cleopatra and Caesar think of each other? Caesar   a man some 30 years her senior   seems to have been instantly captivated by the Egyptian Queen and, after  succumbing to the charm of further intercourse with her, he reconciled her to her brother on the basis of a joint share with him in the royal power . Suetonius tells us that Caesar was smitten by Cleopatra.  He often feasted with her until daybreak, and they would have sailed together in her barge nearly to Ethiopia had his soldiers agreed to follow him.  Cleopatra finally had the military support she needed to rule Egypt. Read more | What did Cleopatra look like? Her brother-husband was livid. On finding his banished sister and Caesar together at the palace, having clearly spent the night together, he reputedly flung his diadem to the ground and stormed out of the room, declaring his sister a traitor to Egypt. Chaos followed. Ptolemy besieged the palace in which Caesar was staying, and Cleopatra s younger sister, Arsinoe, also joined in the fight. She declared herself to be the true queen of Egypt and led rebel forces against her siblings. Ptolemy XIV (depicted left), Cleopatra's brother-husband, was livid when he found his banished sister and Caesar together at the palace. (Photo by Archive Photos/Getty Images) All must have seemed lost for Cleopatra and her Roman lover but, with the arrival of Caesar s troops from Syria, the tide turned once more. Ptolemy and Arsinoe were both defeated. Cleopatra s seat as Egyptian ruler now seemed secure   she was even pregnant with Caesar s child (some time between 47 and 44 BC Cleopatra gave birth to a son whom she named Ptolemy Caesar, or Caesarion]. But, instead, of declaring Cleopatra sole ruler of Egypt, the Roman general instead made her co-ruler with her remaining brother, and soon-to-be husband, 12-year-old Ptolemy XIV In June 47 BC, Cleopatra gave birth to a son, Ptolemy Caesar, known as Caesarion    little Caesar    although the child was never formally acknowledged by his father. The pair followed Caesar to Rome, where they were officially welcomed as  friends and allies of the Roman people . Cleopatra and Caesar: how did Rome react? Beneath the veneer of its friendly exterior, Rome was furious. Caesar had no sons from his Roman wife, Calpurnia, and none from his previous wives. The idea of Caesarion   the son of a foreigner from a land despised as a pleasure-loving and decadent society   growing up to claim rule over  civilised  Rome as Caesar s heir, was intolerable. That situation never came to pass, however, as the Caesar named his grandnephew Octavian (who would later take the name Augustus) as his heir. Caesar: Death of a Dictator Member exclusive | On the Ides of March 44 BC, the most famous Roman in history was murdered. Julius Caesar's assassination transformed Rome forever, and the image of his bloody toga has haunted monarchs and tyrants ever since. Listen to all episodes now On the Ides of March 44 BC, the most famous Roman in history was murdered. Julius Caesar's assassination transformed Rome forever, and the image of his bloody toga has haunted monarchs and tyrants ever since. When did Cleopatra and Caesar's relationship end? In 44 BC, when Caesar was assassinated, Cleopatra   a much-disliked figure in Rome, whose gold-covered statue stood in the city s temple of Venus Genetrix   fled from Rome with her son. Just months later, the Egyptian Queen s second brother-husband was also dead   likely on her orders   and Cleopatra was free to rule with her three-year-old son, and plan the infant s succession as Emperor of Rome. Cleopatra meets Mark Antony Meanwhile, disputes had broken out over who would succeed Caesar, with both Octavian and the Roman general Mark Antony seeking power. By 41 BC, the leadership had been split: Antony was governing the eastern region and Octavian, the west. Following Cleopatra s return, Rome had left Egypt in relative peace, but the Senate s eyes turned once more to the wealthy empire, when Antony decided he needed money to subdue his enemies in the Parthian Empire (now Iraq). Conveniently, Cleopatra had befriended Mark Antony during her time in Rome, and supported him militarily during the ensuing civil war. She now agreed to meet him in Tarsus (modern-day Turkey) to discuss the prospect of Egyptian support in a war against the Parthians. When did Cleopatra and Mark Antony become lovers? In an echo of plans made seven years earlier with her former lover, Cleopatra set out for Tarsus in 41 BC to charm and seduce her unsuspecting old friend. This time, however, her entrance was somewhat grander. In Plutarch s words:  [Cleopatra] came sailing up the River Cydnus in a barge with gilded stern and outspread sails of purple, while oars of silver beat time to the music of flutes and fifes and harps. She herself lay all along, under a canopy of cloth of gold, dressed as Venus in a picture, and beautiful young boys, like painted Cupids, stood on each side to fan her.  The soon-to-be lovers Antony and Cleopatra meet on the water in this 1885 painting. (Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Like Caesar before him, Antony was captivated.  The attraction of her person, joining with the charm of her conversation, and the character that attended all she said or did, was something bewitching,  Plutarch tells us.  It was a pleasure merely to hear the sound of her voice.  Antony was so taken with the Pharaoh that he abandoned his original reasons for meeting at Tarsus. He left his wife Fulvia to manage his affairs in Rome and his troops waiting for orders, while he spent the winter of 41 40 BC in Alexandria with Cleopatra. They were inseparable. During his stay, Cleopatra gained Antony s support in ridding her of the one person who had the power to disrupt her absolute rule in Egypt: Arsinoe. Defeated in battle, Arsinoe had been banished to the Temple of Artemis in Roman-controlled Ephesus, in modern-day Turkey. In 41 BC, on Antony s orders and in scandalous violation of the sanctuary she d been promised, Arsinoe was murdered on the temple steps. The following year Cleopatra gave birth to twins: Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II. Antony, however, had finally been forced to return to Rome to deal with the aftermath of his failed rebellion against Octavian. A political alliance known as the Second Triumvirate was formed between the two generals and a dignitary named Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Recently widowed, Antony agreed to seal the peace deal with a marriage to Octavian s sister, Octavia Minor, in 40 BC. But Cleopatra was never far from Antony s mind and, in 37 BC, he returned to Alexandria where he fathered another son, Ptolemy Philadelphus, and Cleopatra and Caesarion were crowned co-rulers of Egypt and Cyprus. What happened to the Temple of Artemis and the other Seven Wonders of the Ancient World? \"Despite only being a short-lived collection   the last to be completed, the Colossus of Rhodes, stood for less than 60 years   and one of them, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, possibly not existing at all, the Wonders continue to capture imaginations...\" What happened to Cleopatra and Mark Antony? For a happy ending, the story should end there. But it doesn t. Ever greedy for power, Octavian continued to campaign for sole power in Rome, successfully eliminating Lepidus from the Triumvirate. In 33 BC, allegedly in retaliation for Antony divorcing his sister, Octavian did the unthinkable: he declared war on the Egyptian queen. Two years later, in 31 BC, the combined armies of Antony and Cleopatra took on Octavian s forces in a great sea battle at Actium, off Greece s west coast. The battle was a disaster for the lovers. Victorious, Octavian invaded Egypt where he received the surrender of the defeated Roman forces. Antony s efforts to become sole ruler of the Roman world had ended and, first believing that his amour had forged an agreement with Octavian to ensure her own survival, and then that she had committed suicide, he attempted to fall on his sword in true Roman tradition. But even in this he failed, and his wounded body was taken to Cleopatra who, still very much alive, was hiding in a mausoleum. There, Antony succumbed to his wounds, reportedly dying in his lover s arms. Cleopatra realised that without her lover and his troops, she and her beloved country were now at the mercy of the triumphant Octavian. Knowing she would be paraded around as his prisoner should she be captured, the proud Egyptian Queen chose to take her own life, reputedly by allowing a poisonous Egyptian cobra, or aspis, to bite her. Rome had emerged victorious: the age of the Pharaohs was dead. Cleopatra: what is the real legacy of the last pharaoh? For more than 2,000 years Cleopatra VII, final ruler of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, has been portrayed as a manipulative but tragic beauty. Yet, as Joann Fletcher reveals, such simplistic portrayals obscure her true legacy as a strong, politically astute monarch... What happened to Cleopatra's son, Caesarion? Following the deaths of Cleopatra and Mark Antony, the victorious Octavian changed his name to Augustus Caesar and assumed sole control of Rome as its emperor, administering to Egypt s people and controlling its treasury himself. But one last threat to his rule remained: Caesar and Cleopatra s son, Caesarion. Advised by his confidant and philosopher Arius Didymus that  too many Caesars is not good , the new Emperor planned his rival s murder, luring Caesarion to Alexandria with false promises of his safety. The exact circumstances of Caesarion s death are unknown, but it is thought that he may have been strangled, after which Augustus took absolute control of Egypt. The three children Cleopatra bore Mark Antony had different fates to their half brother. Following their parents  deaths, the three were paraded through the streets of Rome in heavy gold chains, walking behind an effigy of their mother: twins Cleopatra Selene and Alexander Helios were ten, while Ptolemy Philadelphus was just four. Ad The three children were given into the care of their former step-mother, Octavia. The two boys disappeared without trace a few years later, but the young Cleopatra later married King Juba II of Mauretania where we know she had at least one child, named Ptolemy Philadelphus, thought to have been named after her younger, missing brother.",

Her reign ended with her death in 30 BC. Known for: Being the last pharaoh of Egypt, being a fabled beauty, her love affairs with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, and   alongside Mark Antony   waging a war on Rome, which she ultimately lost. Outside Europe, in Africa and in Islamic tradition, she was remembered very differently. Arab writers refer to her as a scholar, and 400 years after her death a cult statue of Cleopatra was being honoured at Philae, a religious centre that also attracted pilgrims from further south, outside Egypt. Cause of death: Took her own life, possibly with poison. Legend has it that she encouraged a snake to bite her. Cleopatra VII: Ancient Egypt s most famous daughter, and its last active Pharaoh. A woman immortalised in film, on canvas and in print. An enigmatic heroine to whom William Shakespeare devoted one of his greatest tragedies. Ad Her story is one that has been retold throughout history   full of romance and love, riches and betrayal. But beneath the gold and glamour lies a far darker tale of sibling rivalry taken to the extreme, and a thirst for power that would change the course of history. Born c69 BC, Cleopatra was the third of a possible six children, all of whom shared a common father, Ptolemy XII. The Ptolemaic dynasty, a Macedonian-Greek royal family that had ties to Alexander the Great, had ruled Egypt since 305 BC. Traditionally male rulers took the name Ptolemy, while Ptolemaic Queens were usually named Cleopatra, Arsino  or Berenice. Great reputations Member exclusive | In our podcast series, expert historians discuss the contested reputations of key historical figures, charting the lives and afterlives of Cleopatra, Napoleon Bonaparte, Emmeline Pankhurst and more  Listen to all episodes now In our podcast series, expert historians discuss the contested reputations of key historical figures, charting the lives and afterlives of Cleopatra, Napoleon Bonaparte, Emmeline Pankhurst and more  How did Cleopatra become queen? For Cleopatra, life as a royal daughter was one of luxury. The Egyptian capital Alexandria, the seat of Ptolemaic power, was a thriving cultural centre, attracting scholars, artists and philosophers from all over the world. It was also home to the great Pharos of Alexandria   the 137-metre-tall lighthouse that towered over the city and one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Cleopatra s first taste of power came at the tender age of 14, when she was made co-regent with her father, following his restoration to the throne after three years in exile, albeit with limited powers. Ptolemy XII s return to the throne had cost Cleopatra s elder sister, Berenice   who had seized power in his absence   her life. There may have been a further elder sister, Cleopatra VI Tryphaena, but she too had died by this point. All of this meant that it was 18-year-old Cleopatra who became co-regent with her brother, Ptolemy XIII (aged ten), when her father died in March 51 BC. In true pharaonic tradition, which aimed to keep the royal bloodline as pure as possible, Cleopatra married her younger brother and co-ruler, but it soon became clear that she had no intention of sharing power with him. Within months, Ptolemy XIII s name had been dropped from official documents and Cleopatra s face appeared alone on coins. Cleopatra: what is the real legacy of the last pharaoh? For more than 2,000 years Cleopatra VII, final ruler of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, has been portrayed as a manipulative but tragic beauty. Yet, as Joann Fletcher reveals, such simplistic portrayals obscure her true legacy as a strong, politically astute monarch... Cleopatra is often portrayed by Hollywood as a glamorous femme fatale. Mary Hamer argues that most of what we think we know about Cleopatra is merely the echo of Roman propaganda. Here, she reveals six lesser-know facts about the Egyptian ruler  Cleopatra made an ally of Julius Caesar, who helped to establish her on the throne She then invited him to join her on a voyage up the Nile, and when she subsequently gave birth to a son, she named the baby Caesarion    little Caesar . In Rome this caused a scandal. This was, firstly, because Egypt and its pleasure-loving culture were despised as decadent. But it was also because Caesar had no other sons   though he was married to Calpurnia, and had had two wives before her   and he had just made himself the most powerful man in Rome. Elite Romans were meant to share power, but Caesar seemed to want to be supreme, like a monarch. It was a doubly unbearable prospect: Caesarion, an Egyptian, just might grow up to claim to rule over Rome as Caesar s heir. Fantasies about Cleopatra s beauty are just that Plutarch, the Greek biographer of Mark Antony, claimed it wasn t so much her looks that were so compelling, but her conversation and her intelligence. Cleopatra took control of the way she appeared, coming across differently according to political need. For example, at ceremonial events she would appear dressed as the goddess Isis: it was common for Egyptian rulers to identify themselves with an established deity. On her coins minted in Egypt, meanwhile, she chose to be shown with her father s strong jaw line, to emphasise her inherited right to rule. Sculptures don t give us much of a clue to her looks either: there are two or three heads in the classical style, but also a number of full-length statues in Egyptian style, and her appearance in these is quite different.

(Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) Cleopatra was living in Rome, as the mistress of Julius Caesar, at the time that he was assassinated Caesar s assassination in 44 BC meant Cleopatra herself was in danger, so she left at once. With her little son, Caesarion, she had been living in a palace of her own on the other side of the river Tiber from Caesar s household (though it is likely she hadn t taken up permanent residence there, but returned on regular visits from Egypt). Not surprisingly, Cleopatra had been much disliked in a city that had got rid of its kings, for she d insisted on being addressed as  queen . It can t have helped that to honour her, Caesar had placed a statue of Cleopatra covered in gold in the temple of Venus Genetrix   the goddess who brings forth life, who was held in high regard by his family. Cleopatra was a mother as well as the ruler of Egypt She had Caesarion, her eldest son, represented on the temple wall at Dendera alongside her, as sharing her rule. After her death, the Roman emperor Augustus lured Caesarion back with promises of power, only to have him killed. He was aged 16 or 17, though some sources say he was as young as 14. Mark Antony was the father of Cleopatra s other children, Ptolemy Philadelphus and the twins, Cleopatra Selene and Alexander Helios. The twins were aged 10 and Ptolemy six when their mother died. They were taken to Rome and treated well in the household of Mark Antony s widow, Octavia, where they were educated. The adult Cleopatra Selene was married to Juba, a minor king, and sent to rule with him over Mauretania. She gave birth to another Ptolemy   Cleopatra s only known grandchild. He died in adulthood by order of his cousin, Caligula, so none of Cleopatra s descendants lived to inherit Egypt.

(Photo by World History Archive / Alamy) When we refer to the eighth month as  August , we are celebrating the defeat and death of Cleopatra Augustus founded his reign on the defeat of Cleopatra. When he had the chance to have a month named in his own honour, instead of choosing September   the month of his birth   he chose the eighth month, in which Cleopatra died, to create a yearly reminder of her defeat. Augustus would have liked to lead Cleopatra as a captive through Rome, as other generals did with their prisoners, in the formal triumphs that celebrated their victories. But she killed herself to prevent that. Cleopatra didn t die for love. Like Mark Antony, who killed himself because there was no longer a place of honour for him in the world, Cleopatra chose to die rather than suffer the violence of being paraded, shamed and helpless, through Rome. Augustus had to make do with an image of her that was carried through the streets instead. Cleopatra s name was Greek, but it doesn t mean that she was Cleopatra s family was descended from the Macedonian general Ptolemy, who had picked up Egypt in the shareout after Alexander died. But 250 years then passed before Cleopatra was born   12 generations, with all their love affairs and secret assignations. Today we know that at least one child in 10 is not attributed to their correct biological father    Momma s baby, Poppa s maybe , as they say. Egypt s population included people of many different ethnicities, and naturally that included Africans, since Egypt was a part of Africa. So it s not at all unlikely that long before Cleopatra was born, her Greek heritage had become mixed with other strains. And since the identity of her own grandmother is unknown, it is foolish to think that we re sure of her racial identity. Mary Hamer is the author of Signs of Cleopatra: Reading an Icon Historically (Liverpool University Press, 2008) What are the key moments in Cleopatra's reign? 51 BC | Ptolemy XII dies Having recovered his throne with Roman help in c55 BC, Ptolemy XII dies, leaving Egypt with considerable debts.

        "content": "Cleopatra is always newsworthy. So when in February 2007 a small coin in the collection of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle was said to have changed our understanding of her, it made headlines around the world. Ad Journalists reacted with shock. Cleopatra was no beauty queen, said the reports. The face on the coin was nothing like that of Elizabeth Taylor. Instead she looked  plain , even  shrewish , and had a  hook-like hooter . This was announced as a revelation. Yet for all the fanfare, there was nothing particularly unusual about the Newcastle coin. There are plenty of coins surviving with Cleopatra s portrait on them, and they generally repeat the same features that seemed to astound reporters: a prominent nose, sloping forehead, sharply pointed chin and thin lips, and hollow-looking eye sockets. Where was Cleopatra from? Born c69 BC, Cleopatra was the third of a possible six children, all of whom shared a common father, Ptolemy XII. The Ptolemaic dynasty, a Macedonian-Greek royal family that had ties to Alexander the Great, had ruled Egypt since 305 BC. Traditionally male rulers took the name Ptolemy, while Ptolemaic Queens were usually named Cleopatra, Arsino  or Berenice. Read more about Cleopatra's life What did Cleopatra look like? These coin portraits, surprising though they may be to those who have grown up with a  Hollywood Cleopatra , are the only certain images we have of her. That hasn t stopped people from attempting to dismiss them as inaccurate and overly stylised   hoping against hope that there could have been another face of Cleopatra, a hidden one whose face would better match our expectations. Perhaps, they suggest, these unconvincing portraits were the work of unskilled artists. There s no reason to think these coin portraits are wrong, however. At the time, a warts-and-all approach to portraiture was in vogue in the Mediterranean world, and it seems that Cleopatra s image was no exception to this trend. Features like large noses or determined chins may have been slightly exaggerated, but only because those features were the most recognisable attributes of the individual being portrayed. In this sense they were intended to be realistic. Coin portraits of Cleopatra s father show him with a prominent nose and sloping forehead, so these physical characteristics may well have been family traits Coin portraits of Cleopatra s father, much rarer than those of Cleopatra herself, show him with a prominent nose and sloping forehead, so these physical characteristics may well have been family traits. Her lovers don t match modern popular conceptions either: Julius Caesar has a wrinkled, scrawny neck and hides his bald head with a crown, and Antony s jutting chin and broken nose bear no resemblance to Richard Burton s features. Image of Antony, Cleopatra s lover, on a 2,000-year-old silver coin. (Owen Humphreys/PA Wire) The coins were minted in a variety of places in the eastern Mediterranean, from Alexandria in Egypt to the port of Patras in Greece. Mark Antony bestowed on Cleopatra a number of eastern cities and territories, and coins were issued in those places in the name of the new ruler. Though the portraits found on the coins vary in style from artist to artist, they are generally consistent in detail, which suggests that the artists were following guidelines when they engraved the dies to strike the coins. It s likely that they were copying an official image that the queen herself had approved   nose and chin included. Great reputations Member exclusive | In our podcast series, expert historians discuss the contested reputations of key historical figures, charting the lives and afterlives of Cleopatra, Napoleon Bonaparte, Emmeline Pankhurst and more  Listen to all episodes now In our podcast series, expert historians discuss the contested reputations of key historical figures, charting the lives and afterlives of Cleopatra, Napoleon Bonaparte, Emmeline Pankhurst and more  Was Cleopatra beautiful? Despite her legendary fondness for dressing up, the portraits are rather modest. Cleopatra wears the cloth diadem of a Hellenistic ruler around her head. Her hair is drawn back in braids and coiled in a bun at the base of her skull. Over her shoulders she wears a mantle, covering her gown. A discreet earring hangs from her earlobe, and around her neck is a string of pearls   the only hint of the riches described by the Roman poet Lucan, who pictures a dissolute Cleopatra as decked out  on neck and hair with all the Red Sea spoils . On some coins her mantle seems to be held in place by a clasp that includes more strings of pearls   a treasure that perhaps held great significance at the time (a gift from Caesar or Antony?) Most of the coin portraits date to the mid to late 30s BC, when Cleopatra herself was in her mid to late thirties. Often she is associated with Mark Antony, whose portrait appears on the other side (and occasionally on the same side, next to hers), but she is always described as a queen in her own right, and not just Antony s consort:  Queen Cleopatra, the New Goddess ;  For Cleopatra, Queen of Kings and of children who are kings . On some coins depicting her by herself there is no name attached at all   those distinctive features told people who they were looking at. A coin with the head of Cleopatra. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) The modern negative reaction to the face of Cleopatra tells us more about our love of stories than anything about this most famous of Egyptian queens, who ruled from 51 to 30 BC. For us, the reality of her coin portraits clashes with the much greater myth of Cleopatra, a myth so grand that it has practically consumed the person behind it. Was Cleopatra's beauty a myth? Hollywood did not invent the tradition of the beautiful seductress; that we can believe so says much about its influence in our world. Instead it simply followed a longstanding convention. Hardly had Cleopatra died (allegedly from an asp bite) then the legends began to accrue. In 31 BC she and her lover, Mark Antony, had been defeated by their rival Octavian, and in the following year they died by suicide in Egypt. Octavian had triumphed, but he was the victor in a vicious civil war that had pitted Roman against Roman. The modern negative reaction to the face of Cleopatra tells us more about our love of stories than anything about this most famous of Egyptian queens Cleopatra was a convenient scapegoat. Octavian claimed to have waged war against the foreign queen, not Antony. In this way Antony could be portrayed as a virtuous Roman who had betrayed his homeland through the machinations of an evil temptress. Cleopatra was cast as an irresistible and exotic femme fatale, and Roman writers picked up the theme. The poet Horace declared her a  deadly monster , and Propertius, with even less delicacy, called the queen a  whore . Yet she needed more exceptional qualities to have conquered both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony: according to the Roman historian Cassius Dio she was  a woman of surpassing beauty  with the power to subjugate everyone . Cleopatra's face on a coin. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images) But not all were taken in by this. The Greek biographer Plutarch, writing about a century after Cleopatra s death, had his doubts about her unparalleled physical qualities.  Her beauty was in itself not altogether incomparable , he wrote,  nor such as to strike those who saw her , but he nonetheless credits her with an  irresistible charm . Intelligent and talented, Cleopatra had a gift for making people feel they were the focus of her attention   and that quality, rather than her looks, was her winning trait with Caesar and Antony. Even Cassius Dio conceded that Cleopatra  had a knowledge of how to make herself agreeable to everyone . This is perhaps the closest we can get to the real Cleopatra and the character behind the face on the coins. The beautiful and scheming seductress was a creation of Octavian s propaganda, and unwittingly he created history s greatest love story. But the coins present us with another kind of story   of two ambitious political figures weaving a future together: Antony the Roman triumvir and Cleopatra the queen of kings. Not as romantic, but possibly a face of Cleopatra that the queen herself would have recognised, and of which she would have approved. Ad This article was first published by HistoryExtra in 2016",

        "content": "Cleopatra VII was the Egyptian queen who Romans loved to hate. By the end of 30 BC, her reputation plumbed the depths. She was, after all, the  fatal monster  who had seduced Mark Antony and lured him into an alliance that had ended in defeat to Rome s emperor-in-waiting, Octavian. The whole squalid episode had reached a climax earlier that year when, with Octavian s forces closing in on the Egyptian capital of Alexandria, the couple had taken their own lives. Ad But there s another side to this story. For at the same time as Cleopatra s name was being dragged through the mud, enthusiasm for Egypt   which Octavian had seized for the Roman empire   was at an all-time high in Rome. There was an explosion of Egypt-inspired decoration, from ornate frescoes to hulking pyramids, like Gaius Cestius Epulo s imposing tomb at the Porta San Paolo in the south of the city. On the podcast | Cleopatra: unpicking myth from reality So while Rome was consumed by a burning hatred of Cleopatra, its admiration for the kingdom that had produced her shone undimmed. One person who would, no doubt, have been baffled by this juxtaposition was Antony and Cleopatra s only daughter, Cleopatra Selene. A statue of Cleopatra Selene and her twin brother, Alexander Helios. (Photo by Alamy) Born in 40 BC and raised in the Royal Palace at Alexandria, Cleopatra Selene was around 10 years old when her parents killed themselves. She and her fraternal twin brother, Alexander Helios, and their younger brother, Ptolemy Philadelphos, were taken back to Rome with Octavian and deposited in the household of his sister   and their father s former wife   Octavia, on the Palatine Hill. While Octavian s biographer Suetonius claimed that the (future) emperor was a kindly father-figure to the children, insisting that they be cared for as if they were his own offspring, there was undoubtedly a political dimension to this decision. Retaining control of the children meant that any potential threat to Rome s power over Egypt was neutralised. The sun and the moon This control was first expressed at Octavian s Triple Triumph   an event staged to celebrate his military successes   in the summer of 29 BC. The third and final day of the triumph commemorated his conquest of Egypt, and in the absence of their mother, the children walked alongside an effigy of her entwined with the snakes that had supposedly ended her life. Cleopatra Selene was dressed as the moon and Alexander Helios as the sun, in reference to the celestial names that Antony had bestowed upon them, so as to ensure the crowds lining the processional route would recognise them. Luckily for them, unlike other enemies of Rome such as Vercingetorix of Gaul, their participation in a military triumph did not culminate in their ritual execution. But following the triumph, what was to be done with a princess who was no longer in possession of a kingdom? Octavian made sure that Antony s other surviving children were raised as traditional Romans: Iullus Antonius, Antony s son by his third wife, Fulvia, climbed the cursus honorum (ladder of offices) and was elected consul. Antonia Major and Antonia Minor, Antony s two daughters by Octavia (his fourth wife), were married to suitable Roman men and numbered among their descendants the emperors Caligula, Claudius and Nero. But Cleopatra Selene s situation was not so straightforward. She had, after all, been declared queen of Crete and Cyrenaica (part of modern-day Libya) in her own right by Antony in 34 BC, and could technically be considered the rightful queen of Egypt in the wake of her mother s death. The Death Of Cleopatra. Engraving: Domenichino, Smith. (Photo by GettyImages) Luckily for Octavian, a solution presented itself in the form of another of his wards, Gaius Julius Juba. Like Cleopatra Selene, Juba was the last scion of a deposed royal family in exile. His father, Juba I, had been king of Numidia (a region north of the Sahara), but had backed the loser in the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great. Following Pompey s defeat, Juba I had, like Cleopatra, died by suicide, and his kingdom, his treasure and his progeny had all been confiscated by Rome. Like Cleopatra Selene, Juba had been put on display in a military procession: Julius Caesar s Quadruple Triumph in 46 BC. He had been an infant at the time, and Caesar s biographer Plutarch described him as  the happiest captive ever captured . Cleopatra Selene and Juba were married in around 25 BC before being dispatched to the newly created Roman client kingdom of Mauretania (modern Morocco and Algeria). Their union was commemorated in a poem composed by the Augustan court poet Crinagoras of Mytilene:  Great bordering regions of the world which the full stream of Nile separates from the black Aethiopians, you have by marriage made your sovereigns common to both, turning Egypt and Libya into one country. May the children of these princes ever again rule with unshaken dominion over both lands.  A visible queen Mauretania was the only Roman client kingdom in the west of the empire. It was a vast territory, blessed with considerable natural resources that included many of the luxuries the Romans craved, such as purple dye, citron wood and exotic animals for the arena, as well as staples like grain and fish. It was populated by many different indigenous groups, which are today referred to collectively as  Berbers . There were also Greek and Roman colonies located along the region s Mediterranean coast. On the podcast | Roman women: everything you wanted to know While the women at the very heart of the Roman empire were expected to wield only soft power, client queens out on the periphery   in kingdoms such as Mauretania   would have been much more visible. They would have been involved in all aspects of the day-to-day running of their kingdoms as a matter of course, to the point where their subjects would have been aggrieved had they not participated fully. And of course Cleopatra Selene would have spent her childhood witnessing her mother doing just that, not only ruling her kingdom and receiving embassies from around the ancient Mediterranean, but also visiting and corresponding with other powerful women, such as Queen Amanirenas, who presided over Egypt s neighbour Kush. Cleopatra Selene would likely have seen no reason why, once a queen, she should not do the same. It is little surprise, therefore, that she showed no inclination to step aside and allow Juba to take the lead in their joint enterprise. This coin, showing Juba on one side and Cleopatra Selene on the other, suggests she saw herself as an equal partner in the relationship. (Photo by Alamy) She was, after all, the one with the more prestigious lineage going back to Ptolemy, a general of Alexander the Great, and she could also boast a direct connection to the imperial family through her half-sisters and paternal grandmother, Julia. Instead, the pair ruled together, a fact that their coinage makes abundantly clear. In coins issued jointly (like the example shown above), a portrait of Juba and the Latin legend  Rex Iuba  (King Juba) appears on one side, while a portrait of Cleopatra Selene and the Greek legend  Kleopatra Basilissa  (Queen Cleopatra) is shown on the other. Read more | The female 'kings' of ancient Egypt However, it is notable that Cleopatra Selene also issued her own autonomous coins. These are replete not only with references to herself through crescent moons, but also Egyptian motifs such as crocodiles, ibises, and the crown and sistrum of the goddess Isis. On one coin issue, she even styled herself  Queen Cleopatra, daughter of Queen Cleopatra . This is powerful evidence of the daughter s pride in her mother. Ever cautious and tactful, the couple gave the Mauretanian capital city, Iol, a new name   Caesarea   in Octavian s honour. However, they still found a way to honour Cleopatra and Egypt s culture within the city s walls. The pair embarked upon a lavish building programme to make it a fitting seat for their fledgling dynasty, and they clearly took inspiration from Cleopatra Selene s former home of Alexandria and her mother s building projects there. They constructed a lighthouse in the harbour akin to the famous Pharos, an extensive palace, a forum, a theatre and an amphitheatre. They also planted a sacred grove, as well as renovating old temples and dedicating new ones. Egyptian gods and goddesses soon became popular in Mauretania, and there was a temple of Isis to which Juba dedicated crocodiles. Egyptian works of art were also imported from Cleopatra Selene s former kingdom. So, in many ways, Caesarea was influenced by Alexandria, and in time it would become a highly sophisticated and multicultural court, populated by well-educated and prolific Greek, Roman, Egyptian and African scholars, and talented and creative artisans. In Juba s own writings, he included anecdotes about Egypt, Alexandria and the Nile that most likely came from Cleopatra Selene. This was a way for her to repurpose her memories of her mother and her former life in a manner acceptable to Roman readers. Issues in the afterlife Cleopatra Selene and Juba had, by all measures, turned turbulent childhoods   defeat, captivity, their parents  suicides   into a triumph. But then disaster struck. At some point around the turn of the first millennium, this north African success story was brought to a sudden end by the queen s early death. Although we don t know the precise date of Cleopatra Selene s passing, another poem composed by Crinagoras of Mytilene may provide a clue, as well as serving as an evocative eulogy to the dead queen s achievements:  The moon herself, rising at early eve, dimmed her light, veiling her mourning in night, because she saw her namesake, pretty Selene, going down dead to murky Hades. On her she had bestowed the beauty of her light, and with her death she mingled her own darkness.  In his poem, Crinagoras appears to suggest that Cleopatra Selene s death coincided with a lunar eclipse. This has led historians to propose two possible dates for her demise   23 March 5 BC and 4 May AD 3   both of which witnessed lunar eclipses that were visible in Caesarea and Rome. The queen was interred in a magnificent mausoleum, the remains of which can still be seen near Cherchell in Algeria today. Juba continued to rule Mauretania for two decades after his wife s death, and their son Ptolemy was appointed as a co-ruler in AD 21. (Note that his name was taken from his maternal rather than his paternal lineage, another indication of how Cleopatra Selene promoted her mother and her dynasty.) Tomb of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II, Tipasa ruin, Algeria (Photo by GettyImages) Even after her death, Cleopatra Selene remained a significant figure in the kingdom. A hoard deposited near Tangier contains coins that can be dated to the period AD 11 17, and includes those not only minted by Cleopatra Selene and Juba together, but also ones issued by the queen alone. This suggests that her coinage was not taken out of circulation upon her death and was still in use by her former subjects two decades later. That Juba and Ptolemy were able to stabilise their joint reign was, no doubt, thanks in part to their wife and mother s enduring lustre. Cleopatra Selene had an immense impact on her kingdom and the wider Roman world during her lifetime   even beyond it. So why is she so little known today? Paradoxically, the answer may lie in her success. Roman historians were very much fixated on what was happening in the centre of the empire. They would only mention client-kingdoms when there was a problem. The fact that they didn t write much about Mauretania suggests that things were going smoothly there.

        "content": "According to the ancient Egyptians, the entire universe was made up of masculine and feminine elements, maintained in a state of perfect balance by the goddess Maat. Her numerous fellow deities included a male earth god and female sky goddess. While the green-hued Geb lay back, his star-spangled sister Nut stretched herself high above to form the expanse of sky, hold back the forces of chaos, and give birth to the sun each dawn. Ad Nut was the mother of twin deities Isis and Osiris. Isis was the active partner to her passive brother Osiris, whom she raised from the dead to conceive their child, Horus. Isis was also regarded as  more powerful than a thousand soldiers . This same blend of nurturer and destroyer was shared with Hathor, goddess of love and beauty, capable of transforming into Sekhmet, a deity so fierce that male pharaohs were said to  rage like a Sekhmet  against enemies in battle. Read more about 8 ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses you might not know Such mixing of the sexes was not confined to myth, since Egypt s women were portrayed alongside men at every level of society. This no doubt explains why the Greek historian Herodotus was forced to conclude that the Egyptians  have reversed the ordinary practices of mankind  when visiting Egypt around 450 BC. So while the most common female title in Egypt s 3,000-year history was  lady of the house  (housewife), many women worked in the temple hierarchy. Other women were overseers and administrators, or they held titles ranging from doctor, guard and judge to treasurer, vizier (prime minister) and viceroy. And some women were also monarchs, from the regents who ruled on behalf of underage sons to those who governed in their own right as pharaoh, a term simply meaning  the one from the palace . Yet some Egyptologists still downgrade female rulers by defining them by the relatively modern term  queen , which can simply refer to a woman married to a male king. And while the c15th-century BC Hatshepsut ruled as a pharaoh in her own right, she is still often regarded as the exception that proves the rule   even though the evidence suggests there were at the very least seven female pharaohs, including Nefertiti and the great Cleopatra. These well-known names were simply drawing on female predecessors dating back to the beginning of Egypt s written history and the first such ruler, Merneith (whose reign is dated to around 2970 BC). When her tomb was discovered, at Abydos in 1900, it was claimed that  it can hardly be doubted that Merneith was a king , until the realisation that  he  was a  she  saw her status switched to  queen . Her name nonetheless appeared on a list of Egypt s earliest kings which was discovered in 1986. The evidence for female rulers is as fragmentary as it is for many male counterparts   with few known dates of birth or death, and no known portraits for many. Yet, only the women s titles are routinely downgraded or dismissed, even when the evidence reveals that some, like those profiled on these pages, did rule Egypt as pharaoh. Khentkawes I: The mother of Egypt Title Mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, [holding office as] King of Upper and Lower Egypt Born c2550 2520 BC, possibly at the royal capital Memphis Died c2510 2490 BC One woman whose status has long been debated is Khentkawes I. She was the daughter of King Menkaure, and the wife of King Shepseskaf (ruled c2510 2502 BC), and bore at least two further kings   with new evidence supporting the possibility that she herself also ruled Egypt. Khentkawes I s funerary complex was as elaborate as the nearby pyramids of her male predecessors   so elaborate, in fact, that her tomb has been dubbed the Fourth Pyramid of Giza. It had its own funerary temple, a causeway and, says Ana Tavares, joint field director of the current excavations at her Giza tomb site,  quite exceptionally, a valley temple and a basin/harbour, which suggests that she reigned as a pharaoh at the end of the fourth dynasty . In fact Khentkawes I s kingly status was suggested as early as 1933 by Egyptian archaeologist Selim Hassan during his initial excavation of her tomb. For here she was portrayed enthroned, holding a sceptre and wearing both the royal  uraeus  cobra at her brow and tie-on false beard of kingship combined with her traditional female dress. The tomb also revealed Khentkawes I s official titles in a hieroglyphic inscription, initially translated as  King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt  until British Egyptologist Alan Gardiner found a  philologically tenable  alternative translation meaning that Khentkawes I had only been  the mother of two kings  rather than a king herself. Yet in light of the new archaeological evidence, her ambiguous title is now interpreted as  Mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, [holding office as] King of Upper and Lower Egypt . Khentkawes I certainly left her mark at Giza, where memories that a female ruler had built a great tomb persisted for two millennia. Yet she was by no means unique, for within a couple of decades her descendant Khentkawes II held the same titles, was again portrayed with the royal cobra at her brow, and had her own pyramid at the new royal cemetery, Abusir. There was even a third such woman whose pyramid complex at Sakkara was so large some Egyptologists have suggested she had  an independent reign  at the death of her husband, King Djedkare, in c2375 BC. But this mystery ruler remains anonymous and forgotten, for not only was her name erased from her tomb complex after her death, the 1950s excavation of her tomb was never published and it remains the Pyramid of the Unknown Queen. Sobeknefru: The crocodile queen Title King of Upper and Lower Egypt Born c1830 1815 BC, possibly Hawara in the Fayum Died c1785 BC Despite evidence that some women held kingly powers during the third millennium BC, the first universally accepted female pharaoh is Sobeknefru. Daughter of Amenemhat III, who she succeeded in c1789 BC to rule for approximately four years, Sobeknefru appeared on official king lists for centuries after her death. The first monarch named after crocodile god Sobek, symbol of pharaonic might, Sobeknefru took the standard five royal names of a king   Merytre Satsekhem-nebettawy Djedetkha Sobekkare Sobeknefru   with the epithet Son of Ra (the sun god) amended to Daughter of Ra. Her portraits blended male and female attributes, the striped royal headcloth and male-style kilt worn over female dress. Sobeknefru is also depicted in the cloak associated with her coronation. Yet a more complete portrait was identified as Sobeknefru in 1993, and it s in this that the strong family resemblance to her father, Amenemhat III, can be seen. Sobeknefru created temples at the northern sites Tell Dab a and Herakleopolis, and also completed her father s pyramid complex at Hawara. She seems to have built her own pyramid at Mazghuna near Dahshur, but no trace of her burial has been found. If she is mentioned at all in modern histories, it is only to be dismissed as the last resort of an otherwise male dynasty. Yet the throne passed smoothly to a succession of male kings who followed her lead by naming themselves after the crocodile god. Her innovations inspired the next female pharaoh Hatshepsut (ruled c1479 1458 BC), who adopted the same kingly regalia and false beard. The modern tendency to cast Hatshepsut as a cross-dresser is only possible because her female forerunners have been played down or ignored. Such is the case with Nefertiti. She is judged almost entirely on her beautiful bust, yet evidence suggests she wielded the same kingly powers as her husband and may have succeeded him as sole ruler. Her example was followed by the 12th-century BC female pharaoh Tawosret, whose titles included Strong Bull and Daughter of Ra. She was the last female pharaoh for almost a thousand years, the final millennium BC being marked by successive foreign invasions of Egypt. The most successful of these were the Macedonian Ptolemies, claiming descent from Alexander the Great and ruling for the last three centuries BC. Their Egyptian advisor Manetho created the system of royal dynasties we still use today. He named five of the female pharaohs, stating that  it was decided that women might hold the kingly office  as early as the second dynasty, in the early third millennium BC. Arsinoe II: The queen and female king Titles Queen of Macedonia (& Thrace), King of Upper and Lower Egypt Born c316 BC, most likely at Memphis Died Probably 16 or 17 July 268 BC The legacy of Egypt s female pharaohs certainly inspired Arsinoe II. Married to two successive kings of Macedonia, Arsinoe II then returned to her Egyptian homeland and the court of her younger brother Ptolemy II, marrying him to become queen for a third time. Yet she also became his full co-ruler, with the same combination of names as a traditional pharaoh. This statue of Arsinoe II identified her with the goddess Isis   thanks, in part, to the so-called  Isis knot  on her right shoulder   so exploiting Egyptian tradition to strengthen her image (Image by Getty) Although these titles were long assumed to have been awarded posthumously, recent research has revealed that Arsinoe II was acknowledged as King of Upper and Lower Egypt during her own lifetime. Like Hatshepsut over a thousand years earlier, Arsinoe became Daughter of Ra and adopted the same distinctive regalia to demonstrate continuity with past practice. Further exploiting Egyptian tradition, Arsinoe was likened to the goddess Isis, twinned with her laid-back brother-husband Osiris. As married siblings, Arsinoe and Ptolemy were equated with classical deities Zeus and Hera for their Greek subjects. Joint portraits of Arsinoe and Ptolemy highlighted the family resemblance to putative uncle Alexander, whose mummified body, entombed in their royal capital Alexandria, was further evidence of their divinely inspired dynasty. This too was a relationship Arsinoe exploited to the full, from her subtle adoption of Alexander s trademark ram s horns to staring eyes so large some medical historians claim she must have suffered from exophthalmic goitre, a disease that often affects the thyroid. Arsinoe II certainly used her multi-faceted public image to great effect in her political dealings, when she and Ptolemy II became the first of Alexander s successors to make official contact with Rome in 273 BC. Then, when Egypt joined Athens and Sparta against Macedonia in the Chremonidean War, Arsinoe s lead role was acknowledged in an Athenian decree stating that Ptolemy II was  following the policies of his ancestors and his sister . Athens also honoured the couple with statuary, as did Olympia, where Arsinoe achieved great success in the Olympic Games of 272 BC when her teams won victories in all three chariot races on a single day. Most of Arsinoe s images were in Egypt, where, according to inscriptions set up in the temple at Mendes, it was decreed that  her statue be set up in all the temples. This pleased their priests for they were aware of her noble attitude toward the gods and of her excellent deeds to the benefit of all people.  In Egypt s new capital, Alexandria, Arsinoe s influence was even stronger. Continuing Ptolemaic tradition by spending vast sums on the Great Library and Museum, she personally financed spectacular public festivals with which to impress her subjects, even if fragments of a lost biography reveal her sneering at the  very dirty get-together  of the crowds as they celebrated in the streets beyond her lavish palace. Dazzling legacy Having transformed the Ptolemaic house into a dazzling bastion of conspicuous consumption, 48-year-old Arsinoe died in July 268 BC and was cremated in a Macedonian-style ceremony. Her memory was kept alive at the annual  Arsinoeia  festival, and in the renaming of streets, towns, cities and entire regions in her honour, both in Egypt and around the Mediterranean. Her spiritual presence was so strong that for the next 22 years of Ptolemy II s reign, he never remarried and continued to appear with his deceased wife in official portraits, naming her on official documents and issuing her coinage. As the first Ptolemaic woman to rule as a female king, Arsinoe s achievements were then replicated by the women of her dynasty, the last of whom was Cleopatra the Great. Cleopatra was the final, and of course most famous, culmination of three millennia of Egypt s female pharaohs.

        "title": "Actium, 31 BC: the beginning of the end for Mark Antony and Cleopatra",
        "content": "Mark Antony s campaign to become sole ruler of Rome was crumbling. By the summer of 31 BC, his fleet was trapped in the Ambracian Gulf, on the west coast of Greece, by the ships of his enemy Octavian. Ad He was chronically short of men, and the spot where his army was camped was a mosquito-infested marsh near Actium, on the south shore of the gulf. Their every move was being watched by Octavian s men from the high ground on the opposite shore. Supplies were running out, malaria and dysentery were decimating his army, and the oarsmen who powered his ships were starting to desert. Antony had to make a move, and soon   if he didn t, before long he d have no forces with which to fight. The Battle of Actium was the climax of 13 years of civil wars. Sparked by the assassination of Julius Caesar, they had torn the Roman world apart. Julius Caesar s heir, Octavian, and his former right-hand man, Antony, had been two-thirds of the triumvirate, which, in 42 BC, brought down Caesar s murderers. But once that common enemy had been tackled, their fragile alliance began to fracture and the two became bitter enemies. Octavian s power base was in the western part of the Roman territories, while Antony controlled the eastern part   with the aid of his lover, Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. That relationship gave Antony access to the riches of Egypt but it also scandalised Rome, a situation exacerbated by the fact that Antony had abandoned his Roman wife   who, significantly, was also Octavian s sister. Octavian s propaganda machine was soon hard at work, portraying the struggle not as one between him and Antony but as a war between virtuous Rome and decadent Egypt. What happened at the Battle of Actium? Who | Octavian and Agrippa (400 ship) versus Mark Antony and Cleopatra (500 ships, reduced to 230) When | 2 September 31 BC Where | Ionian Sea near Actium, off the west coast of Greece Why | Antony and Cleopatra were attempting to break through Octavian s naval blockade Outcome | Victory for Octavian. Antony and Cleopatra escaped with their treasure but lost most of their ships In 32 BC, Antony and Cleopatra relocated their forces to the Ambracian Gulf. With a powerful navy numbering some 500 ships, they probably hoped to lure Octavian and his forces into Greece, before destroying his fleet in a pitched battle, thus cutting his supply lines. If so, the ploy worked. Octavian crossed into Greece with a large army. Disastrously for Antony, however, sickness ravaged his forces. Much of his land army was unfit for battle, and he could muster crews for barely half his fleet. Meanwhile, Octavian s loyal general Marcus Agrippa led his own fleet along the coast, capturing key bases. Soon it was Antony and Cleopatra who found themselves cut off near Actium. Antony made a foray to outflank Octavian s army by marching round the Ambracian Gulf, but his efforts came to nothing. He was left with no choice but to abandon Greece, loading up his treasure, embarking as many of his soldiers onto his ships as he could and attempting to break through Octavian s naval blockade. He would then, he hoped, pick up the prevailing wind, sail round the Peloponnese and make for Egypt. Ordering the rest of his army north to Macedonia, Antony readied his fleet   burning many ships for which he no longer had crews   and waited for the weather, which had been stormy for some days, to improve. On 2 September his chance came. At about noon, he moved his ships out of the gulf and into the open sea   where Octavian and Agrippa waited for them, backing up to give themselves enough room to manoeuvre. Who fought at the Battle of Actium? Gaius Julius Octavius (Octavian) Julius Caesar s great-nephew, named by Caesar as his adopted son and heir; later known as Augustus. The two couldn t have been more different: Caesar was bold, impetuous and an inspiring leader, whereas Octavian was careful, methodical and an effective delegator. Festina Lente ( Make haste slowly ) was his motto. He was no great general, but his old friend Marcus Agrippa was an able soldier, and commanded his forces. Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony) A key supporter of Julius Caesar, he helped the great general in his conquest of Gaul. Antony was a born soldier but a rather naive politician. There s no doubt he fell under Cleopatra s spell, but his romantic interest in the Queen was probably heightened by her great wealth and the resources available to her. Cleopatra VII A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a family of Greek origin who had ruled Egypt for nearly 300 years, Cleopatra infamously had love affairs with both Julius Caesar and then Antony. Indeed, she bore them both children. Though Octavian s PR machine portrayed her as a decadent oriental seductress and the implacable enemy of Rome, Cleopatra s main priority was to ensure the survival of her dynasty and the independence of Egypt. What was Antony and Cleopatra's plan? As the sweating oarsmen below decks hauled away, the two fleets began to close in on each other. Up on deck, archers drew their bows and those manning the ballistae (huge crossbows) stood ready to shoot; waiting soldiers gripped their weapons and offered silent prayers that they might not become the victims of enemy missiles. The ships  prows were fitted with rams, but by this era ramming was a comparatively rare occurrence. Instead, helmsmen tried to manoeuvre their vessels into an advantageous position while soldiers rained arrows, javelins and ballista bolts into the ranks of their enemies, while waiting for an opportunity to board the opponent s vessels. Antony was drastically outnumbered. His fleet, reduced by his own hand, now numbered 230 ships compared with Octavian s 400. True, many of his vessels were quinqueremes, formidable warships powered by hundreds of oarsmen and sporting high wooden towers packed with archers. But such ships were slow, and Octavian s advantage in numbers soon began to tell. As the navies clashed and hand-to-hand fighting surged across the decks, some of Octavian s ships began to work their way around the flanks of Antony s smaller fleet. To counter this, and to avoid being completely encircled, Antony s own ships edged sideways as well   creating a gap in the very centre of the line of battle. One account says that, when Mark Antony's men ran out of water to put out the fires, they tried to smother the flames with the bodies of their dead comrades Cleopatra made her move. The galleys under her command had been waiting in reserve, guarding transport ships laden with treasure. Now, she ordered them to hoist their sails and make straight for the gap, quickly escaping from the gulf and getting clean away. Antony followed in hot pursuit. Abandoning his flagship for a smaller, lighter craft, he sailed after his lover, followed by a handful of galleys that escaped the fighting. Octavian s ships gave chase, and the men on Antony s fleeing vessels frantically tried to make them lighter and faster. Towers, catapults, weapons and nonessential equipment were all hastily dumped into the sea; anything that might slow them down was thrown overboard in a desperate bid to enable the ships to outrun their pursuers. Who won the Battle of Actium? Eventually, Octavian s fleet gave up the chase. Their leader would later claim that Cleopatra had sailed off in a panic, and that Antony had abandoned his comrades in order to slavishly follow his lover. In fact, it seems far more likely that this had been a pre-planned gambit, employed to rescue Antony s treasure and escape with as many ships as possible. Antony s wealth was safe   but most of his fleet, left behind at the gulf, had been abandoned to its fate. Anxious to preserve these ships and their crews for his own use, Octavian sailed from vessel to vessel, shouting that Antony had fled and pointing out the futility of further resistance. Not all of Antony s crews were convinced. As Octavian s men approached, expecting to board the defeated ships and accept their surrender, they found themselves driven back by a barrage of missiles. Unwilling to risk their lives now that the victory had been won, Octavian s men resorted to incineration. They circled Antony s doomed ships, bombarding them with flaming javelins and burning arrows. Fanned by a stiff breeze, fires quickly spread through the wooden vessels   but even then, with their ships ablaze, some of Antony s men refused to surrender. One account says that, when they ran out of water to put out the fires, they tried to smother the flames with the bodies of their dead comrades. But at when the weather took a turn for the worse and, faced with the risk of capsizing and drowning as well as burning alive, the survivors finally gave up the fight. Antony s mighty fleet had been all but destroyed. What happened after the Actium? When news of the battle reached Antony s eastern allies, most of them abandoned him, while the army he d sent to Macedonia also defected. He retreated with some 60 ships to the fragile safety of Alexandria in Egypt. But the following summer, Octavian invaded. Deserted by his allies and his surviving troops, Antony committed suicide. Egypt was swallowed up by Octavian s empire and, unwilling to face the humiliation of being paraded through Rome in Octavian s triumphal procession, Cleopatra also killed herself. Octavian, now undisputed master of the Roman world, introduced a series of reforms that gave him control over all aspects of government. Abolishing the old republic, he declared himself emperor for life. Taking the name Augustus, which means lofty or serene, he ruled for over 40 years, until his death in AD 14.

        "content": "Ad They did not ride camels The camel was not used regularly in Egypt until the very end of the dynastic age. Instead, the Egyptians used donkeys as beasts of burden, and boats as a highly convenient means of transport. The River Nile flowed through the centre of their fertile land, creating a natural highway (and sewer!). The current helped those who needed to row from south to north, while the wind made life easy for those who wished to sail in the opposite direction. The river was linked to settlements, quarries and building sites by canals. Huge wooden barges were used to transport grain and heavy stone blocks; light papyrus boats ferried people about their daily business. And every day, high above the river, the sun god Ra was believed to sail across the sky in his solar boat. Not everyone was mummified The mummy   an eviscerated, dried and bandaged corpse   has become a defining Egyptian artefact. Yet mummification was an expensive and time-consuming process, reserved for the more wealthy members of society. The vast majority of Egypt s dead were buried in simple pits in the desert. So why did the elite feel the need to mummify their dead? They believed that it was possible to live again after death, but only if the body retained a recognisable human form. Ironically, this could have been achieved quite easily by burying the dead in direct contact with the hot and sterile desert sand; a natural desiccation would then have occurred. But the elite wanted to be buried in coffins within tombs, and this meant that their corpses, no longer in direct contact with the sand, started to rot. The twin requirements of elaborate burial equipment plus a recognisable body led to the science of artificial mummification. The living shared food with the dead The tomb was designed as an eternal home for the mummified body and the ka spirit that lived beside it. An accessible tomb-chapel allowed families, well-wishers and priests to visit the deceased and leave the regular offerings that the ka required, while a hidden burial chamber protected the mummy from harm. Within the tomb-chapel, food and drink were offered on a regular basis. Having been spiritually consumed by the ka, they were then physically consumed by the living. During the  feast of the valley , an annual festival of death and renewal, many families spent the night in the tomb-chapels of their ancestors. The hours of darkness were spent drinking and feasting by torchlight as the living celebrated their reunion with the dead. Food offerings to the dead.

This meant that women could own, earn, buy, sell and inherit property. They could live unprotected by male guardians and, if widowed or divorced, could raise their own children. They could bring cases before, and be punished by, the law courts. And they were expected to deputise for an absent husband in matters of business. Men and women were treated as equals in ancient Egypt. (Photo by Lizzie Shepherd/Robert Harding via Getty Images) Everyone in ancient Egypt was expected to marry, with husbands and wives being allocated complementary but opposite roles within the marriage. The wife, the  mistress of the house , was responsible for all internal, domestic matters. She raised the children and ran the household while her husband, the dominant partner in the marriage, played the external, wage-earning role. Scribes rarely wrote in hieroglyphs Hieroglyphic writing - a script consisting of many hundreds of intricate images   was beautiful to look at, but time-consuming to create. It was therefore reserved for the most important texts; the writings decorating tomb and temple walls, and texts recording royal achievements. As they went about their daily business, Egypt s scribes routinely used hieratic   a simplified or shorthand form of hieroglyphic writing. Towards the end of the dynastic period they used demotic, an even more simplified version of hieratic. All three scripts were used to write the same ancient Egyptian language. Few of the ancients would have been able to read either hieroglyphs or hieratic: it is estimated that no more than 10 per cent (and perhaps considerably less) of the population was literate. Egyptian hieroglyphics were reserved for the most important texts; the writings decorating tomb and temple walls, and texts recording royal achievements.

But this was not always possible, and the coronation ceremony had the power to convert the most unlikely candidate into an unassailable king. On at least three occasions women took the throne, ruling in their own right as female kings and using the full king s titulary. The most successful of these female rulers, Hatshepsut, ruled Egypt for more than 20 prosperous years. In the English language, where  king  is gender-specific, we might classify Sobeknefru, Hatshepsut and Tausret as queens regnant. In Egyptian, however, the phrase that we conventionally translate as  queen  literally means  king s wife , and is entirely inappropriate for these women. Few Egyptian men married their sisters Some of Egypt s kings married their sisters or half-sisters. These incestuous marriages ensured that the queen was trained in her duties from birth, and that she remained entirely loyal to her husband and their children. They provided appropriate husbands for princesses who might otherwise remain unwed, while restricting the number of potential claimants for the throne. They even provided a link with the gods, several of whom (like Isis and Osiris) enjoyed incestuous unions. However, brother-sister marriages were never compulsory, and some of Egypt s most prominent queens   including Nefertiti   were of non-royal birth. Incestuous marriages were not common outside the royal family until the very end of the dynastic age. The restricted Egyptian kingship terminology ( father ,  mother ,  brother ,  sister ,  son  and  daughter  being the only terms used), and the tendency to apply these words loosely so that  sister  could with equal validity describe an actual sister, a wife or a lover, has led to a lot of confusion over this issue.

Explore her incredible life, her quest her for power and her untimely end. Not all pharaohs built pyramids Almost all the pharaohs of the Old Kingdom (c2686 2125 BC) and Middle Kingdom (c2055 1650 BC) built pyramid-tombs in Egypt s northern deserts. These highly conspicuous monuments linked the kings with the sun god Ra while replicating the mound of creation that emerged from the waters of chaos at the beginning of time. But by the start of the New Kingdom (c1550 BC) pyramid building was out of fashion. Kings would now build two entirely separate funerary monuments. Their mummies would be buried in hidden rock-cut tombs in the Valley of the Kings on the west bank of the Nile at the southern city of Thebes, while a highly visible memorial temple, situated on the border between the cultivated land (home of the living), and the sterile desert (home of the dead), would serve as the focus of the royal mortuary cult. Following the collapse of the New Kingdom, subsequent kings were buried in tombs in northern Egypt: some of their burials have never been discovered. The Great Pyramid was not built by slaves The classical historian Herodotus believed that the Great Pyramid had been built by 100,000 slaves. His image of men, women and children desperately toiling in the harshest of conditions has proved remarkably popular with modern film producers. It is, however, wrong. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Great Pyramid was in fact built by a workforce of 5,000 permanent, salaried employees and up to 20,000 temporary workers. These workers were free men, summoned under the corv e system of national service to put in a three- or four-month shift on the building site before returning home. They were housed in a temporary camp near the pyramid, where they received payment in the form of food, drink, medical attention and, for those who died on duty, burial in the nearby cemetery.

Surely, then, she must have been an outstanding beauty? Her coins suggest that this was probably not the case. All show her in profile with a prominent nose, pronounced chin and deep-set eyes. Of course, Cleopatra s coins reflect the skills of their makers, and it is entirely possible that the queen did not want to appear too feminine on the tokens that represented her sovereignty within and outside Egypt. Unfortunately we have no eyewitness description of the queen. However the classical historian Plutarch   who never actually met Cleopatra   tells us that her charm lay in her demeanour, and in her beautiful voice.

Her passing marked the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which had ruled Egypt since 305/304 BC, following the collapse of the empire established by Alexander the Great. It also enabled Octavian, who in 27 BC would become Augustus, the first Roman emperor, to get his hands on her lands. Ad Cleopatra had a history of staking the fortunes of her nation on Roman men. Firstly, she plumped for Julius Caesar and then, following his assassination, his staunch supporter Mark Antony. A third, however, would prove to be beyond even her legendary powers of persuasion. Read more | How many Cleopatras ruled Ancient Egypt? Together, Antony and Cleopatra tried to block Octavian s path to power, combining their armies in a bid to defeat him. The conflict reached a climax at the legendary battle of Actium in Greece   a ferocious encounter that did not go well for the Queen of Egypt and her Roman general, and they were forced to flee back to Egypt. After Egypt was annexed by Octavian, it was renamed Aegyptus and became   thanks to its prodigious grain production   a key contributor to the Roman economy. The port of Alexandria grew to be the empire's second-largest city. With Octavian s troops marching towards Alexandria, Antony rejoined the battle. Cleopatra, meanwhile, hid herself away in her mausoleum, along with her treasure and two maidservants. Antony picked up information that Cleopatra was dead. Devastated, he fell upon his sword, saying, according to Ancient Greek biographer Plutarch:  I am not pained to be bereft of you, for at once I will be where you are, but it does pain me that I, as a commander, am revealed to be inferior to a woman in courage.  How did Cleopatra die? Antony then received word that Cleopatra was still alive. Fatally wounded, he was taken to her. The queen was distraught but, before he succumbed to death, Antony asked her to make peace with Octavian. Octavian, however, wasn t doing any deals. He wanted Cleopatra as a trophy to parade in Rome but, rather than submit, she too died by suicide. Legend has it she did this by encouraging a snake to bite her, although her two handmaidens died at the same time, suggesting that some other form of poisoning saw her off. While Cleopatra s demise might have taken the edge off of Octavian s victory parade, he was greeted back in Rome as the conquering hero. He now had absolute power over the richest kingdom along the Mediterranean Sea. Egypt had become a mere province for Rome, one of the largest, most powerful empires of the ancient world, to plunder. It would remain under Roman rule until the 7th century. Ad This content first appeared in the August 2017 edition of BBC History Revealed",

I had the privilege of working as a member of his team (on the first electronic telephone exchange, and later ERNIE) at the Post Office Research Station in Dollis Hill in the 1950s, when it was one of the leading research institutions in the world. However, he was a very senior figure in the organisation so my interaction with him was limited. I understood that he d done something remarkable during the war, but the Official Secrets Act was taken very seriously in those days, and the story of Colossus didn t really emerge until the 1970s. What kind of man was he? He was born in London s East End, the son of a bricklayer and the grandson of a charlady. Growing up, money was tight and he was taught to be frugal. While doing an engineering apprenticeship, he took evening classes, gained a degree in electrical engineering and went on to have a distinguished career. I always found him polite, unassuming, and never sexist. What made him a hero? Because he changed the course of history, not once but twice. First, with his Colossus computer, which decrypted a huge number of high-level German messages during the Second World War, part of work estimated to have curtailed the conflict by up to two years. Second, with his pioneering work on early computers that paved the way for the modern digital world. He was also inspirational to me personally, as the sort of manager I wanted to become: he listened to his staff, got quality work out of them and attracted great loyalty. He was the nearest thing to a mentor to me. What was his finest hour? Designing and building the Colossus computer at Bletchley Park in 1943 44. The Mark I Colossus processed information five times faster than Bletchley s previous code-breaking system. Tommy s Mark II Colossus, which began operation on 1 June 1944, decrypted a German message confirming that Hitler, believing that preparations for landings in Normandy were a feint, wanted no extra troops sent there. That helped convince Eisenhower to go ahead with the D-Day landings on 6 June. Can you see any parallels between his life and your own? We both came from modest beginnings, and both studied part-time in the evenings to get our degrees at London University   his was in engineering, mine in mathematics. What would you ask Flowers if you could meet him now? I d like to ask how he felt about the ridiculous lack of recognition he received in his lifetime. He was given an MBE and a couple of honorary doctorates, but that was pretty small fry. I don t know how many people appreciate the true significance of his wartime work.

        "content": "In profile Harry Price was a British ghost-hunter, psychic researcher and author who achieved fame through his investigations into paranormal phenomena and for exposing fraudulent mediums. Renowned for his investigation into Borley Rectory    the most haunted house in England    he died of a heart attack at his West Sussex home at the age of 67. Ad When did you first hear about Price? I was obsessed by ghosts from an early age. When I came across Price he was already something of a mythical figure, thanks to cases such as the Borley Rectory  hauntings  that loomed large in my childhood. What kind of man was he? He had a Walter Mitty quality: he was constantly fictionalising his life and pumping out fake versions of himself   partly, I think, because of his humble background [his father was a travelling salesman]. He lied about where he was born and grew up, and faked archaeological finds and  artefacts  that he d knocked up in his shed. What made Price a hero? I think one should use that word cautiously when talking about Harry, but, for all his flaws, he turned the paranormal into something mainstream and fun, and brought science to the study of the subject. He pretty much invented the concept of the  ghost-hunter , and much of what we associate with  the paranormal  has its roots in his work and the image he cultivated. He made psychic phenomena into news, and became a tabloid figure in what I think of as the golden age of ghost-hunting. Moreover, alongside Harry Houdini, he made it his mission to unmask fake mediums   the rock stars of the day, making huge money   as charlatans and tricksters. What was his finest hour? First, exposing fake mediums who preyed on people s grief. Second, his detective-style investigations into paranormal occurrences, in particular at the Borley Rectory   though plenty of people will tell you that Harry faked phenomena and dramatised events there. He was simultaneously a showman and a researcher, and sometimes the showman won out. Is there anything you don t particularly admire about him? The duplicitousness and slightly free approach to the truth he brought to the study of the paranormal. But I think his admirable qualities outweigh his less-admirable ones. Incidentally, he was also one of the founders of what became the British Film Institute. Read more | 10 terrifying tales from medieval to modern history Can you see any parallels between his life and yours? Like him, I believe that we need to listen to those people who ve had ghostly encounters, and try to make sense of their experiences. What would you ask him if you could meet his ghost? That would be wonderful   and would prove that we were both on the right track! I d like to know if he regretted those occasions when he fluffed the truth and over-dramatised moments in his investigations. The truth should be enough.

        "title": "My history hero: Dame Rachel de Souza chooses Ignatius of Loyola (1491 1556)",
        "content": "Ignatius of Loyola: in profile Ignatius of Loyola was a Spanish Catholic priest and theologian who co-founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) and became its first Superior General in 1541. After being injured in battle in his youth, he underwent a spiritual conversion and devoted his life to the church, missionary work and teaching. He was beatified after his death and later canonised. In 1922 he was declared the patron saint of spiritual retreats, soldiers and education. When did you first hear about Ignatius? I went to a Catholic school and as a little girl I had to recite St Ignatius s prayer. Later, as a student, I got a summer job teaching English to foreign Jesuit students and one of the things I taught them about was Ignatius. The more I learned about him, the more fascinated I became. He s been very influential in my life, though not necessarily in a religious way. Ad What kind of man was he? There were three Ignatiuses. As a young man he was a soldier, womaniser and rebel. After being hit by a cannonball, which shattered his right leg, he lay down his sword and embraced the Christian faith. But the man I really admire is the third Ignatius, the educationalist who reformed the Catholic church and sent out missionaries all over the world. What made Ignatius a hero? He had terrible luck in his life   for instance, he was imprisoned for 42 days during the Spanish Inquisition   but he never gave up and would battle on until he achieved his objective, or persuaded the pope to his way of thinking about a particular issue: he called his approach  storming heaven . It s that determination and ability to persuade, influence and get stuff done that I so admire. What was his finest hour? For me, it was the moment when he decided to change his life. He walked to Montserrat in Spain, climbed the mountain, lay down his sword and dagger at the Virgin s altar at the Benedictine monastery, and vowed to devote his life to rebuilding the church. He then went to live in a cave by the banks of the river Cardoner where he prayed and meditated. It was here that he went through a spiritual experience, changing him as a person, which enabled him to do all the good work he later did as a Jesuit. Is there anything that you don t particularly admire about him? I suspect that he may have been a bit of a nightmare to work with and I m sure he was a hard taskmaster   but the good far outweighs the bad. However, I doubt we d be sending out missionaries these days, would we? Can you see any parallels between Ignatius s life and your own? Like him, my path hasn t been easy, and many of the things he said during his life have inspired me. Like him, I ve also had to battle to get my ideas taken seriously. What would you ask Ignatius if you could meet him? I d ask him what we could do to ensure that the UK is the best place in the world to grow up.

        "content": "Walter Tull: in profile Walter Tull was a professional footballer and British Army officer of Afro-Caribbean descent. He played for Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton Town, among other teams, and was only the third person with a mixed race heritage to play in the top flight of the English Football League. He later served as a second lieutenant in the First World War but was killed in action in 1918, aged just 29. When did you first hear about Walter Tull? When I was asked to present a piece about him for The One Show in 2019   the film marked an anniversary for the charity Action For Children. He lived in one of their children s homes after losing his parents. Ad What kind of man was he? He was the son of a woman from Kent and a Barbadian carpenter, who himself was the son of a slave. By the age of nine he d lost both his parents   his mother died of cancer and his father from heart disease   and was placed in a Methodist children s home in London s East End. But besides having sharp survival instincts, which he would have needed, he clearly had a talent for football. After being spotted playing for amateur side Clapton, he was signed by Tottenham and never looked back. What made him a hero? Firstly, his life story is a fascinating tale of resilience, pragmatism and, I think, pursuit of legitimacy, which is common for many people   myself included   who ve grown up in care. Secondly, his prowess as a footballer and his determination not to be deflected by the racist abuse he received from rival supporters. Lastly, his patriotism and the fact that he clearly loved his country, despite the challenges he d faced in life   hence his decision to enlist in 1914. What was Tull s finest hour? Firstly, carving out a career as one of Britain s first top-flight mixed race footballers, playing for Spurs and Northampton and signing for Rangers, despite suffering racist abuse. One newspaper even applauded him as  a model for all white men who play football . This showed real strength of character, and he paved the way for non-white players in today s game.

He led 26 men on a successful night raid and was recommended for a Military Cross after being killed in action in France. Is there anything that you don t particularly admire about him? I can t think of anything. Can you see any parallels between Tull s life and your own? Yes. Besides our both being of mixed-race, I had a not dissimilar background: I was moved between four foster homes and a care home as a child, so I can relate to his fragmented sense of self and his search for a place in the world. What would you ask him if you could meet him? Having grown up in an orphanage, I d like to know what made him feel at home? What was his sense of home?

        "content": "In a decade in which Vikings have been incredibly vogue   how else to explain the small-screen invasion posed by Vikings, Vikings: Valhalla and The Last Kingdom in recent years   it s surprising that it s taken this long to get to a dramatisation of the Viking Age s purported end in 1066. Ad The BBC s King and Conqueror steps into that breach, taking us back to 11th-century England and the Norman Conquest, to the story told in the Bayeux Tapestry   which you may have heard will be loaned back to the UK from France in 2026. King and Conqueror is the story of how Duke William of Normandy, a man descended from Vikings, won the English throne and became William the Conqueror. But it s also the story of the rise and fall of Harold Godwinson, the last crowned Anglo-Saxon king of England, and a man who had to die for William to succeed. And it s the story of an unlikely bromance between these two men, underscored by an almost-certainly ahistorical heart-to-heart in a bathtub. Who are the king and conqueror of King and Conqueror? James Norton (Happy Valley) stars as Harold Godwinson and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) plays his nemesis, William of Normandy, aka the Conqueror. The eight-part drama begins with the coronation of Harold s predecessor, Edward the Confessor, in 1043, and takes us through to exactly where you d think it would (and if this is a spoiler, apologies, but you ve had nearly 1,000 years to catch up): with Harold dead at the battle of Hastings, with an arrow in his eye. James Norton plays Harold Godwinson in BBC Norman Conquest drama King and Conqueror (Photo via BBC) Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays William the Conqueror in BBC Norman Conquest drama King and Conqueror (Photo via BBC) Whether Harold really was felled by an arrow is a point of scholarly debate (tied to the Bayeux Tapestry, which confusingly, isn t even a tapestry) but the show does a nifty job of explaining the arrow away. Also neatly handled in a story dominated by three men are the women behind the Norman Conquest: Matilda of Flanders (William s wife), Emma of Normandy (Edward s mother), Edith the Fair (Harold s wife) and Edith of Wessex (Harold s sister and Edward s wife, who is named Gunhild in the show). They are all able political actors in their own right, as they were in real history. Elsewhere, though, King and Conqueror could be seen to fall foul of its own ambition, truncating and conflating people and events to its own ends. The portrayal of poor Harald Hardrada, in particular   the Norwegian king and third claimant to England s throne   falls into a familiar  brutish Viking  trope. Is King and Conqueror a true story? Yes, a lot of King and Conqueror is a true story   in the sense that Duke William did invade England, Harold was slain on the battlefield at Hastings, and William claimed the throne in his place   but liberties have been taken with the historical record. Not least, if you set aside Harold, almost none of the historical figures who die in King and Conqueror (and it s a surprising number) meet their end how they are supposed to, when they are supposed to or where they are supposed to. That seems to have been unavoidable as the eight episodes span more than 20 years   there is a lot of history packed in here, and not a lot of time to cover it. Watch this video for the truth behind William and Harold's in-show bromance, or scroll on for the real history behind King and Conqueror   and if you don t want spoilers, look away now. King and Conqueror: the real history ** This section contains major spoilers for King and Conqueror** King and Conqueror opens in 1043, with the coronation of Edward the Confessor. The real Edward was a monarch popularly described as being a bit weak and feeble, and perhaps more concerned with preparing his soul for life ever after than the daily rigours of kingship. This holier-than-thou reputation may have been the result of reinvention and revisionism   historian Tom Licence describes him instead as  strong, glorious, feared by his enemies , a king who wielded power in his own right. But it is the feeble Edward we see here, a touched man who hears the whispered word of God and is ruled by his domineering mother, Emma of Normandy. Eddie Marsan and Juliet Stevenson as King Edward the Confessor and his mother, Emma of Normandy (Photo via BBC) Emma bears the distinction of being the only woman to have been consort to two kings of England: Aethelred the Unready and Cnut the Great. She is also the mother of two more English kings: first Harthacnut from 1040 until 1042, then Edward immediately after. In King and Conquerer, Edward s court is dominated by two factions   the Normans, led by Emma, and the Godwin family. Here, as in real history, Earl Godwin of Wessex is one of the most powerful men in England. His rise came during the chaos that followed the Danish conquest of England in the early 11th century, when he became an advisor to King Cnut. He forged a familial tie with Cnut by marrying a Danish wife, Gytha, whose brother was a jarl [a Danish chief] married to Cnut s own sister. And he created another familial tie with Edward the Confessor, arranging for the king to marry his daughter Edith. This brought Godwin to the height of his power   though in real history, almost three years into Edward s reign. In King and Conqueror Godwin s daughter is named Gunhild, presumably because Harold also marries an Edith, and the laws of historical drama say you can t have two people with the same name. Godwin also has more sons than we see on the small screen   Sweyn, Harold and Tostig should have also been joined by Gyrth, Leofwine and Wulfnoth. In real history, that was important to the succession crisis that happened two decades later. But for now, it is 1043, and it is Edward s coronation. William is present, and he and Harold have met. Neither of these things are true   the earliest existing record of William coming to England says he does so in 1051, and he couldn t have met Harold on that occasion as Harold was in exile (more on that in a moment). The first confirmed meeting we know is in 1065, when Harold ends up in Normandy, and when he apparently swears on holy relics that he would support William as the next king of England. As King and Conqueror tells it, no sooner does the crown touch Edward s head than Emma reveals her true intentions, using her son to banish the Godwins from England. They escape to Flanders, ruled by the Machiavellian Count Baldwin, but minus Harold s wife Edith, who is kidnapped by the Mercians during the escape. William appears here too   he s been ousted from Normandy by his one-time protector, King Henry I of France, who now seeks to murder William and absorb Normandy into his own lands. It makes sense that he would be here, because his wife is Matilda of Flanders, and Baldwin is her father. Though she probably didn t moonlight as a torturer, as the show implies. Cl mence Po sy as Matilda of Flanders, wife of William the Conqueror, who would rule Normandy in his name during the Norman Conquest (Photo via BBC) Emily Beecham as Edith the Fair. The first wife of Harold Godwinson, there's a myth that she was the one to identify his body at Hastings (Photo via BBC) If these events seem a bit rushed, it s because this is contracted history: the real Godwins were exiled, but not until 1051   nearly a decade into Edward s reign. Edith, as far as we know, was never taken captive. Some of the family end up in Flanders, but not all. Harold, in particular, heads to Ireland, before the Godwins raise armies and sail back to regain their lands. He is not Earl of Wessex by this point, as he is in the show   his father doesn t pass on the title until his death in 1053   and so Harold does not have to betray his elder brother Sweyn to get the earldom. Meanwhile, William did have to face down Henry for control of Normandy, but that conflict dragged from the early 1050s through to Henry s death in 1060; during a siege, not the dramatic flourish of single combat as is depicted here. Remember: almost no one dies when, where or how they are supposed to. From there we leap forward to Harold s trip to Normandy, bringing us to the beginning of the Bayeux Tapestry. Now we are in more familiar territory: Harold apparently swearing to uphold William s claim to the crown over the relics of Bayeux; the succession crisis precipitated by Edward the Confessor s death in 1066; Harold taking the throne; Tostig s betrayal; Harald Hardrada s invasion; and finally the three battles that would define England, culminating at Hastings on 14 October 1066. William and Harold share confidences in bathing scene that almost certainly would not have happened (Photo via BBC) What happened to Sweyn Godwinson? The real Sweyn Godwinson does die while ostensibly on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but the reasons for that spiritual journey were quite different. King and Conqueror gives Sweyn Godwinson, the eldest son of Earl Godwin and brother of Harold, a much bigger role in Harold s story than we think he had in real history. A boorish lout, he is shown as quick to anger and rash in action, at one point drawing his sword in the presence of the king to the astonishment of all around him. This is no man fit to rule Wessex, and Godwin passes him over for Harold, mollifying Sweyn with the promise of the earldom of Northumbria. When Harold robs him of that too   giving Northumbria to another brother, Tostig Godwinson   Sweyn becomes a liability, prompting Harold to force Sweyn on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Sweyn escapes, and begins plotting to regain Wessex through force, so Harold has him assassinated. None of that happened as far as we know, but the real Sweyn   who held real power as Earl of Herefordshire   was nonetheless something of liability. In 1046 he abducted an abbess from Leominster, prompting his exile to Flanders in 1047, yet he was back in Englandin 1049, after making a plea to King Edward. That same year, he murdered his cousin, prompting a second exile that was not so easily forgiven. He went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and died in unknown circumstances on his return journey. Whether he was forced to make it as in King and Conqueror, we don t know, but we do know this all took place before Godwin himself died, so Sweyn was never passed over for the earldom of Wessex. Did King Edward the Confessor kill his mother, Emma of Normandy? There is no evidence that Edward the Confessor beat his mother to death with his crown   in fact, says historian Tom Licence, it would have been completely out of character.  It wouldn't fit my understanding of their relationship,  says Licence, who was speaking on this episode of the HistoryExtra podcast about Edward the Confessor's life.  Edward's way of punishing people was to take away their assets or to put them into exile. He hit them in the pocket, not over the head.  While King and Conqueror portrays Edward as so feeble he cannot do without his mother   until he snaps and does away with her entirely in the middle of the series, and in a manner befitting Game of Thrones   the real Edward simply removed her from any proximity to power. When he became king, he confiscated her assets and sent her into  retirement  in the Winchester countryside.  Edward most likely wanted to reduce her political involvement back to a simple status as the widow of the former kings, leaving him to rule independently,  writes historian and archaeologist Cat Jarman.  As far as we know, she lived the rest of her life in Winchester.  Did Edward invite William of Normandy to be his successor? Edward the Confessor may have offered his distant cousin William of Normandy the throne   but probably not by letter, and probably not when King and Conqueror suggests he does. In the drama, Edward sends William a letter naming the Norman duke as his heir after Harold s return from exile. This is what prompts Harold to go to Normandy   taking on the role of messenger, he wants to see how William reacts. But if the real Edward did offer William the throne, it would probably have been when he invited William to England in 1051.  There's definitely contact in that crucial period where the Godwins are expelled,  writes historian Marc Morris.  The Norman and the English sources together   and the behaviour of Edward and the Godwins   strongly suggests that Edward did make a promise of the throne to William.  Eddie Marsan and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror. If the real Edward did offer William the crown, it would probably been in 1051, while the Godwins were in exile (Photo via BBC) Historian David Bates argues that, when Edward died 15 years later and Harold was pronounced king, William would have been compelled to press his claim as a matter of personal honour.  Whatever one makes of the actual dispute, I'm quite prepared to believe that he believed he'd been named as Edward's successor,  Bates told us an upcoming episode of the HistoryExtra podcast about the life of William the Conqueror.  He was presumably going around saying  I'm going to be the next king of the English    it would [have] almost been that he would've lost face if he hadn't tried.  What did Harold really swear to William at Bayeux? No one knows for certain whether Harold gave a solemn oath to uphold William s claim to the English throne. This is a moment of realpolitik in the show, where William springs the oath on Harold in front of witnesses instead of merely confirming an alliance, to the outrage of both Matilda of Flanders and Edith the Fair , who have conspiring towards peace (real history doesn t tell us if Matilda and Edith ever met). Harold, displaying his father s talent for getting out of a tight spot without breaking his word, promises to support the  rightful king . Their eyes are daggers. Harold is forced to swear an oath in the presence of witnesses in King and Conqueror; in real history, he similarly may have been compelled to act under duress (Photo via BBC) This moment, on which the Norman Conquest turns, takes place in 1065. Norman and English sources vary on what was said, and even where this meeting took place   it may not have been Bayeux. Even why Harold went to Normandy is up for interpretation: was it as a messenger, or to assert himself? Did he even mean to meet with William? Whatever the case,  he came into William s hands   as a guest, according to the Normans; as a captive, according to the English,  says Licence on the HistoryExtra podcast.  William then took him campaigning, for diplomatic effect   to show off his new prize and give the impression that Harold was his guest.  This 19th-century illustration depicts Harold Godwinson swearing fealty to William of Normandy   a moment shown in the Bayeux Tapestry. The oath, allegedly made during Harold s visit to Normandy, later served as William s justification for his invasion of England in 1066. (Photo by Getty Images) Did Harold swear his oath under duress then? One detail that the show doesn t include is that, since the 1050s, the real William had been holding one of Harold s brothers (Wulfnoth) and a nephew (Hakon) as hostages. Freeing them may have been the entire reason for Harold s visit.  Harold probably did promise something to William   otherwise, the duke wouldn t have let him go (along with one of the hostages). But it s doubtful that he swore to uphold William s claim to the throne.  Did Edward the Confessor die in a bathtub? No, Edward the Confessor did not die in a bathtub in the throes of passion while his wife Edith of Wessex tried to foist an heir upon him. They may not have even consummated the marriage.  There's a very strong, traditional argument that Edward never really entertained the idea of having a child with Edith,  historian Marc Morris says on our podcast series 1066: The Battle for England. He points to the fact that when the Godwins were exiled in 1051 2, Edward went so far to imprison Edith in an abbey. Even though she was brought back to court when the Godwins returned to power, in that time he made no plans to remarry. The real Edward died on 5 January 1066, after an illness of a few months. This was barely a week after the consecration of Westminster Abbey, where Harold was crowned king the following day. Why did Harold Godwinson claim the throne of England? It is not because he promised his father on his deathbed in the 1060s, as depicted in King and Conqueror   but it may have something to do with someone else s last words.  Debate still rages about what happened on Edward s deathbed,  writes historian Caitlin Ellis. King and Conqueror suggests that Edward said nothing intelligible about the succession and that Harold outright lied to further his own ambitions, but real history is more nuanced.  The Life of King Edward, [a tract] commissioned by his wife and queen Edith   [has Edward] stretching his hand out to Harold and, referring to Edith who was there, declaring  I commend this woman and all the kingdom to your protection ,  says Ellis.  But was protection the same as taking the throne for himself?  Whether that is what Edward meant is also debated   there is some evidence that, regardless of any promise he may have made to William in 1051, Edward now favoured the claim of his only blood relative, the boy Edgar  theling. Edgar isn t mentioned at all in King and Conqueror. Harold s claim rested on him being the most powerful noble in Anglo-Saxon England, and this is where Harold s many brothers come back into the story. By the late 1050s the Godwins controlled Wessex, Northumbria, East Anglia, Kent, Surrey, and parts of Middlesex and Essex, and he made sure to spread his influence beyond the family too.  He goes to great lengths to build bridges with former enemies to make sure he has across the board political approval,  says Marc Morris on our podcast series 1066: The Battle for England, noting that Harold is merely the brother-in-law of the king.  If you are dynastically secure, if you are the son of the previous king and you've been groomed your whole life to succeed your father, and the political community expects that, then you don't need to go to these lengths.  The thing that shows the weakness of Harold's claim is how much people at the time said everybody wanted him to do it.  1066: The battle for England Member exclusive | The year 1066 is the most famous in English history, but there's a lot more to the story than one bloody battle at Hastings.

Watch all episodes now The year 1066 is the most famous in English history, but there's a lot more to the story than one bloody battle at Hastings. In this four-part series, medievalist Marc Morris talks David Musgrove through the full story of the Norman Conquest. Why did Tostig Godwinson betray Harold   and did Harold kill him? Tostig had as much reason for betraying Harold in real history as he does in the King and Conqueror, but there s no evidence that Harold personally killed him at the battle of Stamford Bridge   accidentally or otherwise. Tostig s time as Earl of Northumbria in the show comes to an end when Harold replaces him with Morcar, the Earl of Mercia. It s part of the price that Morcar demands for supporting Harold s claim to be king   the other part being Harold s marriage to his sister. In real history, Tostig was replaced in 1065, while Edward the Confessor was still alive, and in circumstances that testify to how much power Harold had over the king. Luther Ford plays Tostig Godwinson (Photo via BBC) Tostig, it turns out, was not a good earl   he taxed heavily, allegedly murdered some nobles, and was generally unjust   and so Northumbria revolted and offered Morcar the earldom. Morcar, you should know, was not already Earl of Mercia. That belonged to his elder brother Edwin, another historical figure missing from King and Conqueror. Edward s plan was to restore Tostig by force; but Harold overruled him, instead agreeing with the rebels demand to install Morcar. This backfired spectacularly.  The problem was that Harold agreed to a plan in which Tostig gets nothing,  says Morris.  Tostig is gone forever. Perhaps further down the line, Harold thought  Well maybe I can reintroduce him, after a period of political exile , but that wasn't what was agreed, and Tostig is clearly beyond furious about it.  And that fury took him to Norway, and Harald Hardrada. Who was Harald Hardrada and what was his claim to the throne? Reduced to a growling Viking during his limited screentime in King and Conqueror, Harald Hardrada was king of Norway whose English ambitions rest on an inherited claim   but he wasn t invited by Emma of Normandy. In the show, Emma writes to Harald inviting him to claim the throne; the real Emma couldn t have done so in 1060s, as she died in 1052, but there is speculation that in the 1040s she may have written to his predecessor (and for a time, co-ruler as King of Norway), Magnus the Good. Harald Hardrada at the 1066 battle of Stamford Bridge, where both he and Tostig met their demise (Photo via Alamy) As Caitlin Ellis explains:  The later Norse sagas claim that Harald s nephew and erstwhile co-ruler Magnus had made a pact with Harthacnut, King of England and Denmark, as they both lacked male heirs, and when one of them died, the survivor would accede to the other s thrones in addition to their own.  When Harthacnut died, Magnus indeed acceded to the throne of Denmark for a time, but not that of England, as Edward the Confessor had had himself crowned. Harald may have had a tenuous claim, but in all likelihood, he was simply being opportunistic in 1066.  Did Harold Godwinson have two wives? Yes, Harold Godwinson did have two wives, Edith the Fair and later Ealdgyth of Mercia (Margaret in the show)   though only one was married to him in the eyes of the Church. Edith and Harold were married more danico   in the Danish way   which among the nobility of the time would have been seen as perfectly lawful, though not Christian. That meant he could ecclesiastically take Ealdgyth as a second wife, which he likely did to shore up his allegiances in the Midlands and Northumbria in a post-Tostig England   she was sister to Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria. There is some debate as to whether Harold proposed this marriage as early as 1063, which would have brought him closer to Mercia and the leaders of North Wales in place of Northumbria; all we can be sure of is that they were married by early 1066. In the show, neither this marriage pact nor the earldom are enough to prevent Morcar from betraying Harold at Hastings by refusing to enter the fray, rounding off his broadly despicable portrayal. Whether he was quite this much of a villain is not clear   the sources don t explicitly say where the real Morcar (or Edwin) were during the battle. Was Harold killed by an arrow from God? Harold Godwinson probably wasn t killed by an arrow at all   much less one guided by the hand of God. The idea of the arrow   depicted as a crafty bit of post-mortem modification to Harold s corpse in King and Conqueror   has its roots in the Bayeux Tapestry, though some have suggested that its presence there may be the work of later embroiderers rather than its 11th-century creators. But righteousness does hang heavy over the Normans in history, as it does in the drama. Much is made of the comet seen before the battle of Hastings (true   it s Halley s Comet, and it appears in the Bayeux Tapestry) and that William s half-brother Odo secured the blessing of the Pope (partially true   whatever papal backing the Normans had, Odo likely didn t have much to do with it). The extent of the Pope's support in real history is unclear. William of Poitiers writes that Pope Alexander II did sponsor the invasion with a papal banner, but on this episode of HistoryExtra podcast, historian Dan Armstrong suggests that a banner may have been granted later, in 1070, when papal envoys came to England to bolster William s shaky legitimacy, and that Poitiers may have backdated the event to justify the conquest. Arrow or no, we do have some corroboration for an alternative, notes Caitlin Ellis.  The Song of the Battle of Hastings [Carmen de Hastingae Proelio] says instead that Harold was attacked by four knights, including William himself, and that he's basically hacked to pieces.  And so we come to William s coronation   not immediately after Hastings, but on Christmas Day 1066. Ad King and Conqueror is streaming on BBC iPlayer now.

        "content": "Duke William of Normandy, who would become known as William the Conqueror, arguably changed the course of English history more profoundly than any ruler before or since. Ad Despite beginning life as a child of uncertain status in a volatile duchy, he died as king of a realm he had seized by force then reshaped through reform, repression and relentless control. But how did an illegitimate Norman boy become the founder of England s new ruling dynasty? That s a central question posed in the new BBC series King and Conqueror, that tackles William the Conqueror s role in the turbulent and dramatic run up to the events of 1066. Who was Willam the Conqueror? William the Conqueror was the first Norman king of England, whose reign overhauled the country s politics, aristocracy and relationship with Europe. Born the illegitimate son of Duke Robert I of Normandy, William became duke as a child. He fought to secure his rule in a violent and unstable duchy with the support of his wife Matilda of Flanders. In 1066, he claimed the English crown after the death of Edward the Confessor, arguing that Harold Godwinson had broken an oath to support his succession. William s victory at the battle of Hastings marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule. As king, William violently suppressed rebellion to emphasise his power, most brutally during the Harrying of the North. He also restructured the Church, redistributed land to Norman lords and ordered the Domesday Book in 1086. His rule bound England to Normandy and initiated four centuries of close ties to continental Europe. His death in 1087 left a legacy that defined the English monarchy for generations. Watch: The real history behind King and Conqueror The rise of William s family and the Dukes of Normandy By the early 11th century, Normandy was largely shaped by two competing forces: its Viking past, and its evolving place within the feudal politics of France. Just over a century before William s birth, the area that would soon become Normandy was a buffer zone on the edge of Carolingian control.  It was an originally Viking settlement, which was created into a territorial principality, which became Normandy,  says historian David Bates on an episode of the HistoryExtra podcast. To curb repeated Norse raids up the River Seine in what is now France, the country s monarch King Charles the Simple of West Francia struck a deal in AD 911 with a Viking leader named Rollo. In exchange for land around Rouen, Rollo agreed to be baptised, swear loyalty to the king and defend the Seine valley from further Viking attacks. This 1909 illustration depicts the baptism of Rollo, the Viking leader who became the first ruler of Normandy. His conversion to Christianity marked a turning point in the integration of Norse settlers into Frankish society. (Photo by Getty Images) Read more | When was the Viking Age? Rollo s descendants, who would agree to adopt France s titles and language, became the dukes of Normandy. They ruled as quasi-independent magnates with only nominal ties to the French crown. But despite their growing integration into French aristocratic culture, they still retained their own distinct martial identity: military ambition, legal innovation and castle-building became central to their power. As Bates explains,  there was of course some memory of their Viking past.  This shaped the Norman identity and, by the early 11th century, Normandy was densely fortified and, therefore, militarily effective. Its dukes were patrons of reform-minded monasticism, close to Rome and increasingly influential. This was the context that William would be born into. Why was he called William the Bastard? William was born in either 1027 or 1028, the only son of Duke Robert I of Normandy and a woman named Herleva, who was  probably the daughter of a tanner   someone of lower social status . His parents  union wasn t consecrated by the Church, which made William bastardus in Latin, a label that would dog him throughout his life. When did William become Duke of Normandy? When his father died in 1035   while returning from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem   William inherited Normandy. He was just seven years old. With Robert s death came an almost complete collapse of central authority. Rival Norman barons, some of whom questioned the legitimacy of the succession, seized land and turned to private warfare. Several of William s guardians were assassinated, and the young Duke was moved frequently to keep him safe. That William survived at all is surprising, and he owed it in part to the support of King Henry I of France. Henry initially acted as William s protector, helping him to secure the ducal throne against the rebellious Norman barons. The most important instance of this support came in 1047, when Henry fought alongside William at the Battle of Val s Dunes, helping to suppress a major rebellion. William s victory at Val s Dunes, alongside his king, allowed him to begin seriously asserting central authority, rebuilding ducal institutions and strengthening his control of the duchy. Over the following decade, William acted decisively to suppress revolt, assert feudal rights and place his own supporters in positions of power. His military campaigns were complemented by a programme of ecclesiastical reform, especially through his support of Benedictine monasticism. He built and endowed abbeys at Caen, F camp and Jumi ges, aligning himself with both the papacy and the wider reform movement in the Church. William and Henry I of France As William s power in Normandy grew, it threatened the balance of power in northern France, and his alliance with Henry I deteriorated in the early 1050s. By the mid 1050s, Henry had allied with Geoffrey Martel, Count of Anjou, one of William s main rivals, and the two launched several campaigns against Normandy. William defeated these invasions, most notably at the Battle of Mortemer in 1054 and at Varaville in 1057. Bates explains:  it was a manifestation of something that was becoming very clear: William was good at war.  Yet William s success was as much about circumstance as his military prowess, as both Henry and Geoffrey died in quick succession.  Suddenly the world has changed radically, and the two rivals, believe it or not, were succeeded by children,  says Bates. William and Matilda: what was their relationship like? William s marriage in around 1050 to Matilda of Flanders, the daughter of Count Baldwin V, cannily expanded his alliances. Despite initial opposition from the Pope (due to close familial relationship between the couple) the marriage was sanctioned after penance.

Married around 1051, Matilda played a key political role in Norman England and was one of the most influential royal women of the 11th century. (Photo by Getty Images)  Matilda becomes increasingly prominent in the 1050s,  explains Bates.  It is a very successful marriage. It's a very important feature in their lives.  Matilda was also a capable and active consort in her own right.  Matilda is left in effect as the ruler of Normandy in 1066,  says Bates. Her name also appears in charters as a co signatory, reflecting her recognised authority. Together, they had at least nine children, four of whom were sons: Robert Curthose, William Rufus, Richard (who died young), and Henry: all future players in Anglo-Norman politics. What was William s claim to the English crown? William's interest in England s affairs stemmed from family and politics. Edward the Confessor, who ruled England from 1042 to 1066, had spent much of his formative life (roughly from 1016 to 1041) in exile at the Norman court, after his family was ousted by Danish rule. During this period, he developed close ties with Norman aristocracy and ecclesiastics. He spoke Norman French and retained Norman clerics and courtiers after his accession. And according to Norman claims, Edward himself had promised William the English throne, likely in the early 1050s.  I think William made a journey to England in the year 1051, in which, so he claimed, he was promised the succession to the English kingdom by Edward the Confessor.  Whether that promise was ever actually made   or whether it was retroactive propaganda from later Norman sources   there are plausible reasons why Edward might have considered William to be best-placed for the role. It s possible that Edward regarded the Norman ducal family with trust, perhaps more so than the boisterous and powerful Anglo-Saxon nobility that he contended with as king of England. Edward s reign was dominated by the Godwin family, particularly Earl Godwin of Wessex and, later, his son Harold Godwinson. Edward had a tense relationship with the Godwins, culminating in their exile in 1051 and swift return in 1052, which left Edward politically weakened. During the brief period of their exile, Edward may have looked abroad to William as a way of reasserting royal authority. Also, Edward had no children and, as he aged, the question of succession became increasingly urgent. Promising the crown to a continental ally like William might have served both as a hedge against unrest in England and a means of asserting control over the succession; at least in theory. When did William meet Harold? The one meeting between William and Harold that we can be sure of occurred in 1065, when Harold, the most powerful English noble, was shipwrecked in Normandy and taken into William s custody. In this scene from the Bayeux Tapestry, messengers inform William of Normandy that Harold Godwinson has been captured by Count Guy of Ponthieu in 1064   a key moment in the events leading up to the Norman Conquest of England. (Photo by Getty Images) By this point, Harold was Earl of Wessex and the leading nobleman in England, second in power only to King Edward. According to Norman chroniclers, Harold travelled across the Channel on a mission related to Edward s succession, possibly to confirm Edward s earlier promise that William would inherit the throne. English sources make no mention of such a mission, and some later writers suggest Harold s voyage was prompted instead by a family matter in Ponthieu. Whatever its purpose, the journey brought Harold directly into William s orbit for the first time. When Harold arrived on the Norman coast in 1064, he was reportedly shipwrecked off the coast of Ponthieu and captured by Count Guy of Ponthieu, who held him for ransom. It was William who secured Harold s release, either through negotiation or by paying Guy compensation. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts William ceremoniously welcoming Harold into Normandy. During Harold s stay under William s watch, the two men campaigned together in Brittany to support William s ally, Duke Conan II, against a rebellion. Harold fought alongside William s troops, distinguishing himself in battle and earning praise from the Norman duke. The joint campaign strengthened the personal ties between them (at least, temporarily) and demonstrated Harold s military competence. Did Harold give his sworn oath to William? One of the most infamous and contested episodes of Harold s visit to Normandy is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry: Harold swearing a solemn oath to William while placing his hands on what appear to be two reliquaries. This 19th-century illustration depicts Harold Godwinson swearing fealty to William of Normandy   a moment shown in the Bayeux Tapestry. The oath, allegedly made during Harold s visit to Normandy, later served as William s justification for his invasion of England in 1066. (Photo by Getty Images) According to Norman sources such as the priest William of Poitiers, this oath bound Harold to support William s claim to the English throne upon Edward s death, and to uphold William s interests in England. The dramatic staging of this event, with sacred relics hidden beneath a cloth and revealed only after the oath, emphasised the sacred and binding nature of Harold s pledge in Norman eyes. Under medieval custom, an oath sworn on holy relics was considered irrevocable; breaking it could be framed as a mortal sin. Whether Harold made the oath freely or under duress remains uncertain, but it became central to William s justification for invading England in 1066. What was William s claim to the English crown? Edward the Confessor died on 5 January 1066, leaving no heir. The next day, Harold Godwinson was crowned king of England   a decision supported by the Witenagemot, the English council of nobles. William viewed this as a betrayal. He asserted his claim that Edward had promised him the throne and that Harold had sworn to support him. He therefore denounced the English election as invalid and unjust.  Whatever one makes of the actual dispute, I'm quite prepared to accept that he believed he'd been named as Edward's successor,  says Bates.  I think it was almost a matter of personal honour.  But it wasn t just William who had a claim; at least two others had legitimate reasons to feel entitled to the throne. Harald Hardrada asserted that Magnus I of Norway had been promised the English crown by Harthacnut, Edward the Confessor s half-brother, in a mutual succession pact. When Harthacnut died in 1042, Magnus never pursued the claim, but Harald considered it valid, especially after Magnus s death. With the support of Tostig Godwinson, Harold s exiled brother, Hardrada led his own invasion. His failure   defeated at the battle of Stamford Bridge by Harold   is seen as the traditional end of the Viking Age. Another with a strong claim was the closest blood relative of Edward the Confessor: Edgar Aetheling, a great-nephew of the king and a descendant of the royal house of Wessex. However, Edgar, then only 14 or 15 years old, lacked the political backing or military support to press his claim. Crucially for his claim to the English throne, William obtained papal backing from Pope Alexander II, who sent a consecrated banner for the invasion, framing the conquest as a righteous cause. This support helped William recruit troops, ships and financing from across Normandy and neighbouring regions. He was now more than a regional duke pursuing personal ambition; he had become a sanctioned leader of a vital religious campaign. The Norman invasion of England and the battle of Hastings On 28 September 1066, William landed at Pevensey in Sussex. His fleet is estimated at 600 ships and a force of 7,000 to 8,000 men, including Normans, Bretons, Flemings, and French mercenaries. This reconstruction drawing shows Norman forces feigning retreat at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, a tactic that lured sections of the English army into disorder and proved crucial to William s victory. (Photo by Getty Images) He quickly established a fortified base and began raiding the surrounding countryside. Meanwhile, Harold Godwinson had just defeated a major invasion in the north by King Harald Hardrada of Norway and his exiled brother Tostig, at Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Forced to march south depleted and exhausted, Harold confronted William at Hastings on 14 October. The battle of Hastings was fought from morning to dusk. Harold s forces fought from the high ground in a traditional shield wall formation, while William s mixed infantry and cavalry launched repeated assaults. After several hours of stalemate, feigned Norman retreats reportedly lured English troops into disorder. In the final assault, Harold was killed. His death led to the collapse of concerted English resistance. Though not crowned immediately, it was at Hastings that William had effectively won the throne. The Norman Conquest and reorganisation of England William was crowned King of England in Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1066. But his Norman Conquest was far from complete. Resistance   led by figures like Hereward the Wake   persisted for years, and indeed nearly toppled the new king. Such was the scale of the revolt against new Norman rule, Bates says, that William  was facing a moment towards the end of 1069 when everything he wanted to accomplish and believed he had been accomplishing was likely to be destroyed . The most infamous episode was the devastating Harrying of the North, during which William laid waste to large parts of Yorkshire and the Danelaw, leaving vast areas utterly destroyed and depopulated. Contemporary chroniclers described famine, scorched villages and fields sown with salt. It was a calculated move to quash any further resistance. To consolidate power, William rebuilt England s aristocracy almost entirely. Over 4,000 Anglo-Saxon landholders were replaced, with most of the country s land given to a smaller group of around 200 Norman lords. Castles, including motte-and-bailey structures, were built in major towns to secure military control. The Church was also restructured. Archbishop Stigand (the last Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury) was removed and Lanfranc, a Norman reformer, was appointed as his replacement. Thus, the English Church was brought into alignment with continental practice and papal reform ideals. In 1086, William commissioned the Domesday Book, a detailed survey of landholding and resources. It remains the most complete record of any European society in the Middle Ages and a testament to William s administrative accomplishment. Scene 38 of the Bayeux Tapestry shows William of Normandy and his fleet crossing the Channel in 1066. This pivotal moment in the tapestry captures the start of the Norman invasion, a campaign that would transform English history. (Photo by Getty Image) How did William the Conqueror die? William s later reign was consumed by disputes in France. His eldest son, Robert Curthose, rebelled repeatedly over the control of Normandy. Relations with the French king and other nobles became tense, and William returned to the continent frequently to defend his ducal lands. In 1087, while campaigning in the Vexin, William suffered injuries during a raid. He died in Rouen on 9 September 1087. According to one account, his bloated corpse burst during the burial in Caen, where he was laid to rest in the Abbaye-aux-Hommes, a monastery he had founded. Who succeeded William the Conqueror as king? Wiliam the Conqueror's lands were divided after his death: his son Robert inherited Normandy, while William Rufus took the English crown, becoming William II. This separation of realms would lead to decades of rivalry between his sons. Despite the short-term turbulence that followed his death, William s conquest permanently transformed England s political and cultural trajectory. The Anglo-Saxon elite was utterly supplanted, a new aristocratic language was put in place and the legal structures that underpinned society were reshaped. But perhaps his most enduring legacy was geopolitical: William bound England to Normandy, and the wider affairs of continental Europe. For the next four centuries, English monarchs would hold territory in France integrating the country into the web of Franco-Norman aristocracy, leading to complex cross-Channel loyalties and confrontations. William redirected the shape of England s trajectory and the age of the Anglo-Saxons ended with his coronation. A new English identity took shape. It was now time for the rule of the Norman kings. 1066: The battle for England Member exclusive | The year 1066 is the most famous in English history, but there's a lot more to the story than one bloody battle at Hastings.

Ad How did the two men meet? Why did they come to blows, and why did England s king die at the hands of a foreign invader? Few people knew the answers to those questions, and those who did were not impartial. A backstory was therefore invented, to suit the tastes of William s supporters. Or is that Harold s? In fact, there are multiple overlapping backstories, stitched together from legends, guesswork, and propaganda. The historian s task is to sift through all the stories and pick out what might be of use. When did Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror first meet? We know that Harold and William met late in Edward the Confessor s reign, most likely in the summer of 1065. But is this when they first met? In the absence of detailed records, this question is difficult to answer. Harold isn t mentioned in the chronicles before 1049, well into his twenties, so an early meeting with William can t be ruled out. And it s likely that Harold knew who William was. As a son of the Earl of Wessex, he should have known something of the neighbouring princes who, through trade and peacekeeping, had dealings with his father. Normandy was just across the Channel   a neighbour of Wessex in effect. He would have known that the king, Edward the Confessor, had recently lived in Normandy and attended William s court. James Norton plays Harold Godwinson in BBC Norman Conquest drama King and Conqueror (Photo via BBC) Nikolai Coster-Waldau plays William the Conqueror in BBC Norman Conquest drama King and Conqueror (Photo via BBC) But the early 1050s brought trouble for Harold: There was a powerful party of Normans at Edward s court, vying with Harold s family to dominate the king s counsel. Matters came to a head in 1051   Harold s family lost, and were driven into exile. In late 1051, William visited Edward in England, but Harold was in Ireland and would not have met him then. At some point, probably in 1052, William also got hold of two of Harold s close relatives   a brother and a nephew   as hostages. Harold, still in exile, would not have met him then either. But from then on, William was associated with the hostile Norman party at Edward s court. Exactly how William got hold of Harold s relatives as hostages is far from clear. They may have been kidnapped by the Normans who fled England when Harold s family returned in 1052. Or perhaps Edward sent them to William in case Harold s family sought vengeance upon him for their exile. Either way, in Harold s mind, William was now a hostile agency, who had something over on him. King and Conqueror imagines William and Harold sharing confidences in bathing scene, something that almost certainly would not have happened (Photo via BBC) It's possible that Harold met William in the mid-1050s. Edward s contemporary biographer reports that Harold travelled in the Frankish lands and studied the tactics and capabilities of Frankish princes. A charter of 1056 shows that Harold was present in Flanders at that time, with its count, Baldwin, and other counts, including Guy of Ponthieu (who appears in the Bayeux Tapestry). Although William doesn t appear with him in the charter, Harold might have visited other places besides Flanders on his foreign trip. He may at some point have visited Normandy to see the hostages, and from 1053   after succeeding his father as Earl of Wessex   he d have had to deal with William in cross-Channel business. But the only meeting we can be sure of occurred late in Edward s reign, most likely in the summer of 1065, when Harold travelled to the Frankish lands a second time. He came into William s hands   as a guest, according to the Normans; as a captive, according to the English   and the two men went campaigning in Brittany. Watch: The real history behind King and Conqueror Why did Harold travel to Normandy? The first generation of English writers after the Norman Conquest are totally silent about Harold s trip, which is telling in itself. It suggests that something happened that was relevant to 1066 and that had to be covered up. Norman sources claim that Edward had sent Harold to offer William the English throne (or to confirm an earlier promise). English sources give various explanations, including an attempt to bargain for the release of the hostages and a fishing expedition blown off course (which is possibly a euphemism for an intelligence-gathering trip).ge The Bayeux Tapestry may imply that Harold wasn t heading for Normandy, since it shows him landing in the neighbouring county of Ponthieu, whose count begins to escort him north to Beaurain, in the opposite direction. But men from William arrive and pressure Guy into handing Harold over. The one thing that does emerge from a judicious appraisal of this mixed bag of sources is that Harold tried to avoid falling prey to William. William then took him campaigning, for diplomatic effect   to show off his new prize and give the impression that Harold was his guest. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts Harold Godwinson being apprehended as he lands in Ponthieu and taken prisoner by Count Guy of Ponthieu (Photo via Getty) When he later made Harold swear oaths of some sort, the set-up was the same. Harold appeared, before onlookers, to swear the oaths willingly but in reality did so under duress. It was a piece of political theatre. Norman and English sources disagree on the content of the oaths and even on where the ceremony took place (Bayeux, Rouen, and Bonneville-sur-Touques all being named by different writers). William s supporters, defending his invasion after 1066, claimed that Harold had sworn to uphold the Duke s claim to the English throne and garrison castles for him. Other accounts told of oaths Harold had sworn involving a marital alliance with the Norman ducal house. Harold probably did promise something to William   otherwise, the Duke wouldn t have let him go (along with one of the hostages). But it s doubtful that he swore to uphold William s claim to the throne, which was manufactured in 1066 and justified in hindsight. There s no evidence in any source from before that date that Edward desired to make William his heir. This 19th-century illustration depicts Harold Godwinson swearing fealty to William of Normandy   a moment shown in the Bayeux Tapestry. The oath, allegedly made during Harold s visit to Normandy, later served as William s justification for his invasion of England in 1066. (Photo by Getty Images) By that point, if not long before, Harold and William were rightly very wary of each other, harbouring multiple grudges. From William s point of view, Harold s family had thwarted Norman ambitions at Edward s court and crushed and expelled the Norman faction. From Harold s perspective, William was a wily opponent who had a hold over his family in the form of the two hostages. Eadmer, an English writer born in 1060, presents William as an extremely dangerous man, which he was. William s supporters project such qualities onto Harold, portraying him as an arch-deceiver, treacherous in every respect. At the battle of Hastings, there was no neat accidental death by a random arrow. Rather, William s troop made a beeline for Harold and hacked him to pieces, with one knight cutting off Harold s genitals as a trophy. The world was too small for two men such as Harold and William to share it. Undoubtedly, there was a lot of additional backstory that we ll never know. The bitterness of 1066 does suggest that William felt that Harold had betrayed him somehow. Harold, for his part, may have had no other choice, realising that William was a man like himself, who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. 1066: The battle for England Member exclusive | The year 1066 is the most famous in English history, but there's a lot more to the story than one bloody battle at Hastings.

There's never been a full investigation,  says McKelvie.  No one is ever found guilty of it. The fact there s no investigation tells us a lot.  A king without friends James s death may be mysterious, but his unpopularity was incredibly evident, and simple to explain. Throughout his reign, the king had consistently alienated the powerful men who were meant to support him, and isolated himself from traditional networks of power. McKelvie notes that James  is someone who is reputed to have not liked the company of his nobles,  and that  he was not universally liked   he s described as a king who surrounds himself with unpopular favourites . That fact   prioritising favourites over the hierarchy of nobles   is a recurring motif in medieval history, and a deadly trap that many of history s worst monarchs have fallen into. But it wasn t just seeking the company of the wrong individuals that ruined James III s status as king. He had also earned a reputation for turning against those closest to him.  He also is tainted with potentially killing his wife as well,  McKelvie says. Margaret had died from sudden illness, with potential foul play being suspected.  His reputation generally [was] as someone who will harm members of his own family.  That included his brother, Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, whose somewhat death in France during a duel had already cast a long shadow over the king. This all contributed to a portrait of James as a monarch whose downfall had become increasingly inevitable as he failed to navigate the dangerous terrain of kingship. The new regime benefited from silence After James III was killed, the new regime under James IV offered a vague, bloodless explanation: the king had been slain  by a vile person . It was, as McKelvie puts it,  as ambiguous as you can get.  The wording is telling; not only in its evasion, but in what it chooses not to pursue.  Even if James IV didn t want his father harmed,  McKelvie notes.  He must have known a rebellion that leaves a king alive never succeeds.  Did James IV have his own father killed? (Photo via Getty) It was in the new king s political interest to ensure his father didn t survive the rebellion, and even more so that no one investigated how, or by whose hand, the old king had died. The result was a murder with no trial, no punishment and no clear record of guilt. King James III, now dead, was simply brushed out of history by his own son. Flight, fatalism, and a royal ending What little we do know of the specific circumstances surrounding James III s death paints a picture of a monarch brought down not by one knife used by a single discontented murderer, but by years of corrosive mistrust and resentment. His capture and murder weren t part of a formal execution. They were, more likely, an act of political necessity by the rebels. No killer was ever named. No one was punished. The new regime moved on, and the question of who killed the king was quietly left behind. Yet though James s death remains shrouded in mystery, the causes are anything but.  Even though he didn t stab himself,  McKelvie reflects,  he was more responsible for his own death than anyone else.  Isolated, distrusted, and ultimately abandoned, James was a monarch whose murder remains an unsolved mystery not because the truth couldn t have been discovered, but because no one in power had any inclination to discover it.",

It s a thought-provoking and perhaps controversial list. Read on to discover who were the worst Brits of all... Ad 1000 1100 Eadric Streona Nominated by Professor Sarah Foot of Sheffield University Illustration by Jonty Clark Eadric Streona (died 1017) might have been Aethelred II s chief counsellor and ealdorman of Mercia   but he has a reputation for deception, treachery and murder. I nominate him because of the villainous part he played in England s defeat by the Danish king, Cnut. He was implicated in the murder of Gunnhild and Pallig in 1002 and of Ealdorman Aelfhelm in 1006   at which time the ealdorman s two sons, Wulfheah and Ufegeat, were blinded. In 1009 when the English were ready to attack the Danes a Chronicler reported that the whole people  was hindered by Ealdorman Eadric, then as it always was . In 1015 he was directly involved in the murder of two thegns (noblemen)   Sigeferth and Morcar   who, according to chronicles, he  enticed  into his chamber where they were  basely killed . In the same year, having been in command of King Aethelred s army, he changed sides and joined Cnut. He subsequently switched sides a further couple of times, in 1016 joining first Edmund Ironside and then deserting him at the battle at Assandun (Ashingdon) to rejoin Cnut who pursued Edmund into Gloucestershire where the latter died in mysterious circumstances. This cruel, unscrupulous individual grew rich out of the proceeds of royal taxation and was a traitor to the English cause. But having being initially rewarded by Cnut   when he d become king of all England   Eadric was killed in 1017 having outlived his usefulness to the new regime. It was a fitting end. Sarah Foot is the author of Monastic life in Anglo-Saxon England (Cambridge University Press, 2006). 1100 1200 Thomas Becket Nominated by Professor John Hudson of St Andrews University Illustration by Jonty Clark There are a handful of characters in history about whom prejudice seems impossible to avoid. One such is Thomas Becket (c 1120 70), Archbishop of Canterbury. He divided England in a way that even many churchmen who shared some of his views thought unnecessary and self-indulgent. And he has remained a figure inspiring both devotion and detestation. He was a founder of gesture politics, with the most acute of eye for what would now be called the photo-opportunity. He was also a master of the soundbite. When put on trial in front of a secular court, he refused to accept its jurisdiction, stating  such as I am, I am your father; I will not hear your judgement . He pushed his way from the court chamber, bearing his cross before him. Complex issues were confronted by a mixture of inflexibility and grand display. When he left England during his dispute with Henry II, he went to the kingdom of France, furthering the conflict between Henry and the French king, and at the very least opening himself to the accusation of being a traitor. Certainly he was viewed by some as hypocritical, as he changed dramatically from his ostentatious life-style before he was archbishop. As archbishop, he also looked to contemporary medical views for help in retaining some enjoyable habits, claiming to have to drink wine rather than water because it better suited his stomach. He was also greedy. In 1164 he was brought to trial in part on charges of embezzlement during his time as royal chancellor, the position he held before he became archbishop of Canterbury. The truth of such charges must remain uncertain. However, the wealth of Thomas and his following by the late 1150s was immense and famous. How did he assemble such wealth? Presumably by profiting from his position in the royal administration. Those who share my prejudice against Becket may consider his assassination in Canterbury Cathedral on 29 December 1170 a fittingly grisly end. However, it also ensured that, as a martyr, he became a saint with a cult that spread with tremendous speed. John Hudson is author of The Oxford History of the Laws of England (Oxford University Press). 1200 1300 King John Nominated by historian Marc Morris Illustration by Jonty Clark Once described as a man of  superhuman wickedness , King John of England (1167 1216) has had a pretty awful press. Perhaps his most damning critic was Matthew Paris, a monk at St Albans, who in the mid 13th century wrote:  Foul as it is, Hell itself is defiled by the fouler presence of King John . This kind of verdict was eagerly seized on by 19th-century historians to create the monster of legend, the Bad King John. However, the fact remains that John committed some wicked deeds and was a deeply unpleasant person. He was unpleasant in many ways   in the way he behaved towards people; he was untrusting; he would snigger at people while they talked; he couldn t resist kicking a man when he was down. What s more, he was a bully and a gloater. Stories about his cruelty are legion, and the deed which has most damned him in the eyes of the world is the murder, possibly by his own hands, of his nephew Arthur   a rival for the throne. Granted, John was competent when it came to the small-scale tyrant stuff   he could lead an army, he was energetic and dynamic   but his charisma was all negative. He didn t inspire loyalty, so people deserted him. That was partly why he lost his father s continental lands   in effect, squandering the family inheritance. He was clearly one of the worst kings in English history and his reign will always by defined by that one great evil deed   the murder of his nephew. One good thing to come out of his reign was Magna Carta, an attempt to limit his abuses and ensure they could not be repeated. Marc Morris is author of The Bigod Earls of Norfolk in the Thirteenth Century (Boydell, 2005). 1300 1400 Hugh Despenser (the Younger) Nominated by Nigel Saul, professor of medieval history at Royal Holloway, London University Illustration by Jonty Clark I nominate Edward II s appalling favourite, the Younger Hugh Despenser (died 1326). Despenser was neither so well known nor so notorious as his predecessor in Edward s favour, Piers Gaveston, but he was far worse. Gaveston was just a playboy. Despenser was pure evil. Dominant at court in the last years of Edward s reign, he set about eliminating his enemies and amassing a vast territorial empire in South Wales. His rapacity knew no bounds. He gobbled up the lands and possessions forfeited by those who opposed him and his king. He browbeat the weak and the vulnerable into signing away their estates. He tricked people into parting with their property. Women were especially vulnerable to his ambitions. Alice Lacy, the Earl of Lancaster s widow, was thrown into prison and forced to sign away her rights. The widow of Sir John Gifford of Brimpsfield was ejected from her estates. Lady Baret of Swansea was allegedly tortured so badly that she went out of her mind. Visiting merchants were robbed of their property. In a stained glass window in Tewkesbury Abbey, Despenser looks all arrogant and swagger. But pride cometh before the fall. In the autumn of 1326 the tyrannical regime Despenser headed was toppled, and Edward deposed. At Hereford in November he was visited with the full penalties of the traitor. He was drawn, and then hanged from a gallows 50 feet high; his intestines were torn out and burned in front of him. Nigel Saul is author of The Three Richards: Richard I, Richard II and Richard III (Hambledon & London, 2005). 1400 1500 Thomas Arundel Nominated by Miri Rubin, professor of history at Queen Mary, University of London Illustration by Jonty Clark Thomas Arundel (1353 1414), administrator and archbishop of Canterbury, earns his place in this list of infamy not for a single infamous act, but for the long-term effect of his success in bringing together church and state, as never before, in the persecution of unorthodox religious opinion. In this link between religious ideas and sedition lay the foundation for a system of persecution of religious ideas in England which would be used by rulers for centuries. Until Arundel, England had no part in the intensive inquisitorial and persecutory activities which had long been common practice on much of the Continent. The Concordat between Henry IV and Arundel gradually created such a system through ordinances and statutes. At Oxford in 1407 he phrased ordinances   later extended as Constitutions for the realm   which limited the translation and reading of the Bible in English. The programme was completed shortly after his death, when secular officials, royal justices and sheriffs, were required by oath to enquire into heresy wherever their powers took them. As a result, he made life harder for a generation of people who wished to express and explore their religious ideas, to read the Bible in a language they understood, and discuss the  big questions , while his clearing out of  venomous weeds  from Oxford meant that intellectual life there became bland for a very long time. Above all, by enlisting royal officials, and encouraging neighbours to snoop, suspect and inform   he authorised a thoroughly unpleasant involvement of the state in people s lives. Miri Rubin is author of The Hollow Crown: A History of Britain in the Late Middle Ages (Penguin, 2005). 1500 1600 Sir Richard Rich, Lord Rich of Leighs Nominated by David Loades, emeritus professor of history at the University of Wales Illustration by Jonty Clark I ve chosen Sir Richard Rich (1496/7 1567), who seems to have had no principles, political or religious, but simply joined whichever side seemed likeliest to further his career. According to John Foxe (author of the Acts & Monuments of the English Martyrs, first published in 1563), he was personally responsible for the torture of Anne Askew   who d broken off her marriage to an orthodox Catholic   in 1546 and was charged with heresy. He is reputed to have operated the machine himself despite the fact that women (and especially gentlewomen) were supposed to be exempt from torture. He is alleged to have committed perjury to secure the conviction of Thomas More for treason. He promoted Protestantism under Edward VI, and then persecuted Protestants under Mary. A lawyer by profession, Rich was a man who was constantly on the make, constantly on the lookout for the main chance. He became a powerful minister to Henry VIII and was Lord Chancellor during much of King Edward VI s reign. It is difficult to quite know what to make of him personally but nobody seems to have been very fond of him. Greedy he certainly was, and cruel   to judge from the Anne Askew affair. He was responsible for several burnings of heretics in Essex, and acted as a bigot because it was convenient to appear as such at that time. In short, Rich was a slippery and unprincipled opportunist. For centuries after his death his name was a byword in the county of Essex for wickedness. Right up to the 20th century, it was said  better a poor man at ease than Lord Rich of Leighs . David Loades is the author of Intrigue and Treason: the Tudor Court 1547 1558 (Pearson, 2004). 1600 1700 Titus Oates Nominated by John Adamson, a fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge University Illustration by Jonty Clark The self-styled Dr Titus Oates (1649 1705) was in a league of his own, both in the depths of his vileness   a comprehensive blend of vanity, murderous con-trickery, and serpentine guile   and the scale of the evil for which he was responsible. He was the principal promoter, in 1678, of the fantasy that there was a Jesuit conspiracy to assassinate Charles II (with silver bullets) as a prelude to a French-backed Catholic reconquest of the country. Undoubtedly his most evil act was allowing 16 innocent laymen, and eight Catholic priests, to go to a hideous death (the penalty for treason being partial hanging, castration and disembowelment alive, and then the quartering of the corpse) as a result of his spurious accusations. Oates s entire career was built on the purveyance of various forms of malice and falsity. At the height of the Popish Plot mania, he laid an indictment against the Lord Chief Justice who, refusing to succumb to the popular hysteria, had acquitted four of the men implicated by Oates s accusations. He would have willingly sent these four, and the Chief Justice, to the gallows for his own aggrandisement. Anyone who is prepared to see innocent men go to their deaths   and particularly grisly deaths at that   on accusations that he knows to be false qualifies as cruel, bloodthirsty, and a bigot. What makes Oates s knavery all the more invidious is that his motives appear to have been largely financial: he expected, and eventually obtained, a substantial reward from the Whig interests which profited from his accusations. In 1678 79, Oates s actions arguably brought the country close to the brink of another civil war. And while Oates did not create anti-Popery, his fantasies certainly sharply exacerbated a religious hatred that would endure in British society well into the 19th century. In short, he was a thoroughly odious individual. John Adamson is author of The Noble Revolt: The Overthrow of Charles I (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2007). 1700 1800 Duke of Cumberland Nominated by Professor Rab Houston, chair of modern history at St Andrews University Illustration by Jonty Clark The Duke of Cumberland (Prince William Augustus, 1721 65) showed his wickedness in many ways, not least in his contempt for opponents and for his own men who failed to live up to his strict standards. He showed a particular disdain for the defeated Jacobites after the battle of Culloden in 1746, who he regarded as cowardly, dishonourable and undeserving of mercy. Thus fleeing soldiers were pursued and slaughtered while the wounded could expect no help except to be shot, bayoneted or clubbed to death. At a time when the etiquette of warfare was considered very important, Cumberland was able to dispense with it by labelling the Highlanders as inhuman savages. He even condemned officers who had shown mercy to the Jacobite soldiers after the battle, when his orders were to give no quarter. The Highlanders hated him, renaming a weed Stinking Billy in mockery of the English renaming of a flower Sweet William in his honour. In effect, he used the full power of the fiscal-military British state to commit genocide on the mainland of Britain. He was the equal of Cromwell in Ireland, terrorising a whole people into submission. The English welcomed the Duke s victory but opinion turned against him equally quickly. He acquired the title of Butcher because, when told that he was to be made an honorary freeman of a London company for his services against the Jacobites, some wag said it would have to be the Butchers. The Duke s successes were recognised by his being voted an income of  40,000 per annum in addition to his revenue as a prince of the royal house. It was, in effect, blood money earned by war crimes. While much of Cumberland s reputation rests on the immediate events surrounding Culloden, he was also a strong advocate and savage pursuer of the suppression of Highland culture. He left behind him the largest army of occupation ever seen in Britain in order to pacify the Highlands while permanent fortifications were built. He contributed to a policy of cultural imperialism by disarming the Highlands, abolishing the wearing of Highland dress, suppressing certain surnames linked with the rebellion and seeking to extirpate Catholicism from the land. He even suggested transporting whole clans like the Camerons and MacPhersons to the colonies   a sort of ethnic cleansing. By helping to destroy the social nexus of the clan that was at the heart of Highland society, he helped sever the bond between chiefs and clanspeople that had been the basis of Highland society for centuries. Lastly, by institutionalising the prejudice that the Highlanders were uncivilised, Cumberland also contributed to the racist views responsible for their later misfortunes.

Firstly, because he preyed on the most pathetic and vulnerable women in London s East End. Secondly, for the sheer horror of his brutal crimes. During his murder spree in the autumn of 1888, Jack the Ripper definitely killed five prostitutes   and possibly a couple of other women too   in the most appalling and extreme circumstances. His victims were disembowelled, their intestines draped over their shoulders and their breasts cut off. This man was manifestly a savage brute and while he may have had mental problems   he must have had, to do what he did   they can t excuse his terrible actions. The murders had huge repercussions at the time   and have influenced our view of serial killers ever since. For months after the murders women across the land, be it in Norwich or Newcastle, were terrified to go out at night. And while the press might have coined the name by which this most notorious serial killer is known, this does not detract from the savagery of his crimes. Of course, we assume it was  Jack , and it probably was, but it just might have been  Jill . The Ripper has become a villain   for all time   and his shadow extends to the present day. And the way in which the world responds to modern serial killers such as the Yorkshire Ripper is influenced by the way we responded to the most notorious serial killer of all, Jack the Ripper. All sorts of people have been accused of being Jack the Ripper: the painter Walter Sickert; rogue royals; Freemasons, you name it   but it seems unlikely we ll ever know his true identity. However, this has just served to add to the mystique surrounding this most wicked of men. Clive Emsley is the author of Hard Men: Violence in England since 1750 (Hambledon, 2005). 1900 2000 Oswald Mosley Nominated by Professor Joanna Bourke of the School of History, Classics, and Archaeology, Birkbeck College, London Illustration by Jonty Clark Oswald Mosley (1896 1980) was the founder of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in 1932. He remains an inspiration for far-right groups in Britain and thus continues to have a pernicious impact on our society. His authoritarian politics relied on anti-Semitism and anti-immigration, and the party s willingness to use violence was most notoriously exhibited at the Fascist rally at Olympia in 1934. His most evil act was inciting anti-Semitic feeling and in 1934, the BUF launched an anti-Semitic campaign in the East End of London, home to one-third of British Jews. He attacked the  big Jews  for threatening the economy and the  little Jews  for  swamping  British cultural identity. While he never succeeded in turning Britain Fascist, 70 per cent of respondents under 30 chose Fascism, when asked to choose between it and Communism, in a Gallup Poll in 1937. He was handsome and charming, and his early career   in the Conservative and then Labour Party   showed him to be a man of ideas and energy. In the early 1920s, his opposition to the  Old Men  who supervised the carnage of the First World War won him many supporters. However he was vain, megalomaniac, and had delusions of grandeur, although Attlee observed that his theatrical displays were routinely derided (at one meeting, when Mosley strode on stage with his arm uplifted, a voice called out,  Yes, Oswald dear, you may go to the lavatory ). It would be difficult to find a more unpopular politician than Mosley in 1945: he was widely regarded as a traitor and a symbol of Fascism. On his death in 1980 his son Nicholas concluded that his father was a man whose  right hand dealt with grandiose ideas and glory  while his left hand  let the rat out of the sewer .

        "content": "The wedding guest list and seating plan When Prince Harry married the American actress Meghan Markle at a ceremony in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 19 May 2018, the couple defied royal tradition by keeping political and religious leaders off the guest list. Most royals before them have been obliged to invite hundreds of guests whom they have never met before, in the interests of diplomacy. Ad The task of organising a royal wedding falls to the Lord Chamberlain in his capacity as  Impressario of Pageantry to the Queen . Among the myriad duties involved is the drafting of the guest list, and as most full royal weddings involve at least 2,000 invitees, this is no mean feat. It is also the Lord Chamberlain s job to arrange the seating plan for the ceremony. At Westminster Abbey   where Harry s elder brother, William, got married to Catherine Middleton in 2011   this is complicated by the fact that only 800 of the 2,000-strong congregation are able to see anything of the procession because of the pillars and other architectural features blocking the view, and fewer still catch a glimpse of the wedding ceremony itself. The worse the view, the less important the guest. Only a limited number of the guests at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011 were actually able to see anything of the procession because of the pillars and other architectural features of Westminster Abbey. (Photo by Clara Molden - WPA Pool/Getty Images) Not all British royal weddings were celebrated with the pomp and ceremony that we are used to nowadays. One of the earliest, between William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders, was so secret that to this day nobody knows when or where it took place. The couple were marrying in defiance of an edict issued by the pope because they were related within the prohibited degree of kinship. Almost five centuries later, Henry VIII also defied the pope when he married Anne Boleyn before his first marriage to Catherine of Aragon had been annulled. Meanwhile, Edward IV kept his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464 a secret because he did not dare to tell his own council that he had married a widow and, worse still, a commoner. He only admitted to the marriage five months later, and it aroused such opposition that it was declared invalid following the king s death in 1483. Henry VIII married Anne Boleyn in secret, probably on 25 January 1533, in his private chapel at Westminster. Their discretion was so successful that even to this day, the date and location of their wedding is not certain. But Henry s courtiers quickly noticed a difference in Anne s status because of her clothing. Eustace Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador to Henry VIII s court from 1529 to 1545, reported to his master, Charles V:  On Saturday  dame Anne went to mass in Royal state, loaded with jewels, clothes in a robe of cloth of gold frieze  and was brought to church, and brought back with the solemnities or even more, which were used to the queen.  It is only since Victorian times that royal weddings have been held during the day. Before then they were always evening affairs, conducted in private in the presence of just a handful of guests. One such wedding was that of James II s daughter Mary, who married her first cousin, Prince William of Orange, in 1677, in a ceremony that took place at 9pm in her bedchamber at St James s Palace. Even some modern royals have got away with keeping their not-so-big day a similarly intimate affair. The wedding of Princess Margaret s daughter, Sarah Armstrong-Jones, to her long-term partner, Daniel Chatto, was one of the most low-key royal weddings in history. It took place on 14 July 1994 at the small but perfectly formed Wren church of St Stephen Walbrook in the City of London, which holds just 200 guests. The ceremony was so quick that it caught the chauffeurs of the guests unawares, and several members of the royal family   including the Queen, Prince Philip and Princess Diana   were obliged to make small talk while waiting for their cars to arrive. Wedding dress traditions Think of a wedding dress, and the chances are you re imagining something white and meringue-like. But the choice of white is a relatively recent tradition in the history of royal weddings. Until the early 19th century, the bride could wear any colour she chose   blue was a particular favourite, as was black. All of this changed with Queen Victoria, who wore white so that she was as visible as possible to the huge crowds that thronged the processional route. Her efforts were rewarded. In her diary entry for that day, she wrote:  I never saw such crowds of people... and they cheered most enthusiastically.  Queen Victoria wearing her wedding dress next to her husband, Prince Albert, photographed by Roger Fenton in 1854. Queen Victoria began the trend for white wedding dresses. (Photo by Granger Historical Picture Archive/Alamy Stock Photo) The oldest surviving wedding dress is that of Princess Charlotte, who married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfield in 1816. It was an extraordinarily ornate gown made from silver tissue with a netted silk underskirt, richly embroidered shells and bouquets, and trimmed with Brussels point lace. It was worth in excess of  10,000   the equivalent of around  570,000 in today s money. The gown is now preserved at Hampton Court Palace as part of the Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection. We can no doubt look forward to seeing an array of glamorous outfits at Windsor on 19 May. In this respect, little has changed: throughout history, guests have turned out in their finest attire to celebrate their sovereign s big day. Elizabeth I s great favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, once spent more on a magnificent new outfit than Shakespeare did on his lavish new house in Stratford-upon-Avon. Food and feasting: the wedding reception Royal nuptials have changed a great deal over the years, but one feature unites even the most modest of them: the wedding feast. For many hundreds of years, a wedding has provided the perfect excuse for a good nosh-up, and this has been particularly true of those involving a royal bride and groom. Although menus are scarce among the contemporary records, there are numerous descriptions of the  pleasure and magnificence  of the feasting that followed the ceremony. Take the wedding of Henry III and Eleanor of Provence in 1236, for example. Their meal was so sumptuous that a heavy tax had to be levied to pay for it, which made the couple deeply unpopular from the start. The king,  glittering very gloriously , took his place with his new wife at the head of the feast, which had been arranged by the Earl Marshal. One eyewitness described the  abundance of meats and dishes, with large quantities of venison and a variety of fish , which was all served to  the joyous sounds of the gleemen , or minstrels. Similar magnificence was observed at the wedding feast of the first Tudor king, Henry VII, and his bride, Elizabeth of York. Although the menu has not survived, it is interesting to speculate whether the royal cooks would have prepared for the newly married couple any of the foods believed to excite lust: chestnuts, pistachios and pine nuts had long been used in folk medicine to stimulate the libido. The consumption of meat, meanwhile, was believed to strengthen the husband s potency, as well as aiding the wife s fertility. An illustration depicting the wedding of the first Tudor king, Henry VII, to Elizabeth of York. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) In between each course the royal couple would have been served with a  subtlety    a lavish sculpture of marchpane (marzipan) or spun sugar, covered with gold leaf. A popular design for weddings was a model of the new wife shown in the last stages of pregnancy   just in case she was not already aware of what was expected of her! Neither were the Tudors prudish about phallic-shaped foods like asparagus, or those that could inspire sexual puns, such as  apricock . It is difficult to imagine such ribaldry in modern royal weddings. Neither are they always as extravagant as their precedents. When Queen Elizabeth II married Philip Mountbatten in 1947, post-war austerity took its toll on the wedding feast. Guests were served a main course of unrationed partridges, while the cake   which was nine feet tall   was not nearly as sumptuous as it appeared. In fact it had been cobbled together by a selection of different cake-makers working with strictly rationed ingredients. So careful was the royal family to avoid any hint of excess in such straitened times that one loyal fan from Brooklyn, New York, sent the newlyweds a turkey as a gift because she feared that they would go hungry. To avoid such unwanted (if well-intentioned) presents in future, the royal family now invites donations to nominated charities instead. Royal marriage consummation: the bedding ceremony When the last dishes of the sumptuous and protracted wedding feast had been served, the royal couple were escorted by many of their guests to their private apartments for the  bedding ceremony . The very public beginning to this essentially private event was for a purpose: even after the wedding ceremony had taken place in church, a marriage was not considered binding until it had been consummated. Sexual failure could have far-reaching consequences for a royal couple, sparking political unrest and even rebellion. It was therefore imperative that members of their court and household be given sufficient reassurance that the act had been satisfactorily performed. The bedding ceremony was subject to a similarly strict set of rules as the marriage ceremony and wedding feast. The bride would be escorted to her chamber by her ladies, who undressed her and put her to bed. The groom, meanwhile, was stripped down to just his shirt   an undergarment that would have reached to at least mid-thigh. Then, accompanied by his gentlemen attendants, musicians, priests and bishops, he would join his wife in the bedchamber. The clerics would pronounce their blessings, and then a concoction of wine and spices would be served. Known as the void or voidee, this was a mixture of expensive sweet and sharp spices such as pepper, saffron, ginger, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. It was thought to be beneficial to health and digestion, as well as sweetening the breath and engendering strength and courage. The onlookers were often slow to leave. Sometimes, they demanded to see the naked legs of the couple touching, which in some cases was accepted as a sign of consummation. Others expected to witness the royal newlyweds kissing or embracing. When the couple were at last alone, they would be serenaded with a repertoire of lewd songs from the other side of the door, often until the following morning. All of this served as a crude reminder that a royal body was the property of the state, and its functions were of great interest to the people of the realm. In this respect, the king and his wife were poorer than the lowliest of their subjects. The latter may not have enjoyed the array of comforts that came with royal blood, but they at least had the luxury of a private life in its true sense. The earliest record of an English royal bedding ceremony was between Henry V and Catherine of Valois on 2 June 1420. Although their union was later romanticised by Shakespeare (in Henry V, believed to have been written in around 1599), the reality was the result of hard bargaining between the English king and his French counterpart. After the couple had been put to bed, their courtiers and attendants left them to consummate the marriage. But Henry and Catherine enjoyed only fleeting privacy because later that night their guests formed a great procession and came to their bedside carrying wine and soup to fortify them after their  exertions .

(Photo by Kean Collection/Getty Images) Undoubtedly, the most controversial wedding night in history was that of Arthur, Prince of Wales, eldest son and heir of King Henry VII, and the Spanish princess Catherine of Aragon in November 1501. Even though the couple adhered to the traditional bedding ceremony, whether or not they consummated their union has been the source of intense speculation ever since. The morning after their wedding, Arthur, a frail 15-year-old, emerged from the chamber calling for a drink for he had spent the night  in Spain . For her part, Catherine insisted that the marriage had not been consummated. Her husband died just four months later, and Catherine later married his younger brother Henry   the future Henry VIII. When this marriage failed to produce the longed-for male heir, Henry sought to annul it on the grounds that the Bible forbade a man to take his brother s wife. He called upon witnesses to testify that the marriage had been consummated   something that Catherine continued to stoutly deny. Who was telling the truth? The debate still rages today. Marrying a foreigner Prince Harry followed centuries of royal wedding tradition by choosing a foreign bride. Traditionally, marriage between royal families was one of the most effective ways of cementing international alliances. For example, the marriage of Henry VII s firstborn son, Prince Arthur, to Catherine of Aragon brought Henry a powerful Spanish ally. Thousands of people lined the streets, craning to catch a glimpse of the exotic princess, who was decked out in  costly apparel both of goldsmith s work and embroidery, rich jewels [and] massy chains  as she rode on a horse decked with glittering gold bells and spangles. Unusually for the time, both Catherine and her groom were dressed all in white. The bride was led into the church by her soon-to-be brother-in-law, the 10-year-old Prince Henry. Already, young Henry had the charisma and presence that his elder brother and father notably lacked. Another Tudor,  Bloody  Mary, was in 1554 so intent upon marrying Philip II of Spain that she rode roughshod over her subjects  objections to a foreign king. It had been love at first sight for Mary, even though it was only his portrait that she had seen. She was no less besotted when she met the man himself, and married him two days later, on 25 July 1554 at Winchester Cathedral. But the marriage was deeply unpopular with her xenophobic subjects, who did not want a foreigner as their king and thought England would be dominated by Spain. Thomas Wyatt led a rebellion against it even before Philip had set foot on English soil, and it remained a cause of simmering resentment throughout Mary s ill-fated reign. The marriage of Mary I and Philip II of Spain was deeply unpopular with the queen s xenophobic subjects. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) But what of American brides? Undoubtedly the most famous   and notorious   was Wallis Simpson, for whom Edward VIII gave up his crown. The king s obsession with a woman who had two living ex-husbands sparked a constitutional crisis and led to his abdication in December 1936 to marry  the woman I love . Although Meghan Markle is also a divorcee, the rules have been relaxed in recent years, so there is no question of Prince Harry giving up his place in the succession in order to take her as his bride.

        "title": "Henry VIII: Three films",
        "content": "If you ve watched The Tudors on BBC Two over the last few years, you ll have seen Henry VIII as a young man. He was regarded as handsome, athletic and intellectually curious during the early years of his long reign (1509 47). The legendary Henry is the ageing, rotund and ill-tempered king who struggled to produce a male heir and sent two of his six wives to the executioner s block. His story has been told innumerable times, in different styles and from many vantage points, and interest in it shows no signs of abating. Nevertheless, an early talkie, made in 1933 and on a modest budget, remains the definitive portrait of the man. Ad The films 1. The Private Life of Henry VIII Dir: Alexander Korda, UK, 1933. With Charles Laughton, Robert Donat, Merle Oberon, Elsa Lanchester As the title suggests, Alexander Korda s film takes a through-the-keyhole vantage point on Henry, preferring his marital affairs to affairs of state. Catherine of Aragon is swept aside in the flippant opening titles ( her story is of no particular interest   she was a respectable woman ) and the film opens in 1536 as Anne Boleyn (played by Merle Oberon) faces execution with resigned, quiet dignity. It then makes its way through Henry s marriages to Jane Seymour (Wendy Barrie), Anne of Cleves (Elsa Lanchester), Catherine Howard (Binnie Barnes) and Katherine Parr (Everley Gregg). Much of this is played for laughs.  It s all chop and change,  one character observes from the sidelines, and Henry himself groans about  the things I ve done for England  as he reluctantly enters into marriage with the unattractive Anne of Cleves. This is history as it would play at the music hall: filled with saucy comments, naughty puns, and a lusty hero whose appetites render him ridiculous. It is doubtful the film would hold together were it not for Charles Laughton. From the moment he strides into the frame, assuming the aggressive image made famous by Hans Holbein s full-length portrait of Henry, Laughton manages to imbue the iconic figure with humanity, tragedy and humour. This Henry, like Holbein s, is a middle-aged figure striking a powerful pose, but the film is daring enough to play this for laughs. No other actor or film has found this combination of malice and mirth in Henry. Yet as memorable as some of its jokes and its central performance may be, The Private Life of Henry VIII is actually a little too scrappy and rough around the edges to be a true film classic. Its status as a landmark in film history relies as much on its reception as its aesthetic qualities. In the early 1930s, British films rarely travelled well and historical films were out of fashion, but this was an international success and it brought many more historical films in its wake. But is it accurate? Most historians were not impressed. Some complained about the film s focus on the private life, and its complete disinterest in worldly matters. There is no mention of the break with Rome or the English Reformation. Others complained about a plethora of tiny details, including the incorrect placement of the buckles on Henry s shoes. Audiences did not share these concerns, and Korda followed a similar path with his subsequent films about Catherine the Great, Rembrandt and Nelson. Accuracy: 5/10 2. Anne of the Thousand Days Dir: Charles Jarrott, UK/USA, 1969. With Richard Burton, Genevi ve Bujold, Irene Papas, Anthony Quayle Korda s film was made during the Depression, and portrays Henry as the embodiment of the people s will. In the 1960s 70s, however, filmmakers regarded Henry s reign as divisive and authoritarian. Censorship had loosened and religious issues were no longer off-limits, but this view of Henry also suited an era which questioned authority and saw the establishment as corrupt and self-serving. In Anne of the Thousand Days, Henry (Richard Burton) is portrayed as a man eager to justify his actions. He searches his soul, but finding it shallow, arrives quickly at conclusions that suit his own needs. As soon as he spots the young Anne Boleyn (Genevi ve Bujold) he is eager to divorce the loving, but also ageing and clinging, Catherine of Aragon (Irene Papas). He courts Anne, but she has been warned by her sister Mary (Valerie Gearon), who is pregnant with Henry s child, that  the moment you re conquered he ll walk away from you . Anne therefore sneers at his promises of riches and favours, and insists that she ll only sleep with him if they are married, so that their offspring will be in line for the succession. The break with Rome thus serves as Henry s means of conquering the wilful Anne. When they are married, and Elizabeth is born rather than a son, Henry quickly wearies of Anne and so he readily believes the accusations of adultery and incest that lead to her execution. Based on a popular play by Maxwell Anderson, the film is a bit stagey and overly long. Richard Burton also lacks the gusto that might be expected of Henry, but Bujold just about manages to make Anne spirited rather than merely shrewish. There is also ample production gloss in this Hollywood film: stunning photography, lavish sets, beautiful costumes and some attractive location filming. But is it accurate? The film compresses events that took place over many years and fits them into a tight storyline. A more questionable aspect is Anne s defiance of Henry. While it is true that she resisted becoming just another one of his mistresses, it is unlikely that she was hostile to him or berated him in the manner heard here. The ending   when she defiantly declares that  my Elizabeth shall be queen and my blood will have been well spent    gives her the last word, as well as a sense of historical vision, but she would not have imagined this so confidently. Elizabeth s future was far from certain at the time of Anne s execution. Accuracy: 6/10 3. The Other Boleyn Girl Dir: Justin Chadwick, UK/USA, 2008. With Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana, Mark Rylance, Kristin Scott Thomas Henry VIII (played by Eric Bana) is pushed to the sidelines in this account of the aspirational Boleyn family. Based on Philippa Gregory s bestselling novel, the story primarily concerns sisters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson) and their rivalry for Henry s affections. The story itself is speculative, insofar as it tries to imagine what went on behind closed doors and in lives (especially Mary Boleyn s) about which comparatively little is known. It takes considerable liberties. For example, Mary Boleyn was regarded as a  wanton  woman in her lifetime and not as the sweet and innocent girl portrayed here. Mary had an affair with Henry, but there is no evidence that she was his true love (rather than Anne) and most historians disregard rumours that Mary had a child by Henry. There is no record of Mary attending Anne s execution, and afterward she certainly did not kidnap Elizabeth and raise the future queen herself, as the ending of the film suggests. And while Anne was accused of incest, alongside the accusations of adultery, the charge is generally regarded as unjust. The film, however, suggests that Anne and her brother at least contemplated incest, as a desperate means of producing Henry s much-needed heir. Where Anne of the Thousand Days portrays its heroine as fiery and formidable, the Anne of The Other Boleyn Girl is grasping and manipulative. Mary Boleyn is the more sympathetic figure, but Scarlett Johansson looks out of place and her blank expressions are uninvolving. Bana, as Henry, is given little to do other than look mean and moody. The film occasionally comes to a halt as the characters speak in paragraphs to explain the historical basis of the story. But this is really an old-fashioned melodrama, complete with ominous lashings of thunder and lightning, a minxish heroine who meets with her comeuppance, and, in Henry, a brooding and unpredictable hero not unlike Heathcliff. But is it accurate? No, but many people enjoyed seeing the story told in this form rather than as worthy and serious historical drama. It is not for everyone, but if the idea of a 16th-century version of Footballers  Wives is appealing, then this is the film for you. Accuracy: 2/10 Other films about Henry VIII Young Bess (Dir: George Sidney, USA, 1953) Charles Laughton reprises his role as the king in this portrait of Queen Elizabeth I s youth. A Man for all Seasons (Dir: Fred Zinnemann, UK, 1966) Henry (Robert Shaw) is seldom seen in a film which focuses on Thomas More (Paul Scofield) and his execution. Henry the Eighth and His Six Wives (Dir: Waris Hussein, UK, 1972) This is in some respects the opposite of the Korda film: more serious, more accurate and less entertaining.

        "title": "The Royal Stuarts: A History of the Family that Shaped Britain",
        "content": "Reviewed by: Roger Mason Author: Allan Massie Publisher: Jonathan Cape Price (RRP):  20 Ad At the end of his highly readable chronicle of the lives and loves of the Stuart family, arguably Britain s most successful royal dynasty, Allan Massie concludes:  It was a long journey from the salt-marshes of Brittany to the gloom of the Palazzo Muti.  Originating among the Anglo-Breton aristocracy who settled in Scotland at the invitation of the crown in the 12th century, the family took its name from the hereditary title  High Steward  bestowed upon Walter Fitzalan by King David I. Several generations later, his direct descendant, Walter Stewart, married Marjorie, daughter of Robert Bruce, and it was their son who came to the Scottish throne as Robert II when the main Bruce line failed in 1371. For the next 150 years, Stewart son followed Stewart father until the death of James V in 1542, leaving as his sole legitimate heir a six-day-old daughter, Mary Queen of Scots. That Mary succeeded unchallenged is testimony to how deep-rooted the principle of primogeniture had become in Scotland, where the antiquity and continuity of the royal dynasty was seen as a symbol and guarantor of the kingdom s independence. As an adult, of course, Mary tested Scottish political conservatism to the limits   and well beyond. Yet by marrying a member of a cadet branch of the family, Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, and bearing him a son, James, Mary did at least ensure the future of the dynasty, albeit now under the Frenchified form of the name, Stuart. Not only that, but despite Mary s execution at the hands of Elizabeth for conspiring to oust the Tudors, in 1603 her son became King James I of England and Ireland as well as James VI of Scotland. For the next century and a half the Stuart family dominated the politics of Britain and Ireland, whether as reigning monarchs struggling (and, in the case of Charles I, spectacularly failing) to maintain control of their composite monarchy or as Jacobite  pretenders  to the throne following the overthrow of James VII and II in 1688 amidst fears that this Catholic king had ensured a Catholic succession. Spanning well over three centuries, and with a cast of compelling characters, the story of the Stuarts is an entertaining family saga that combines high political drama with low personal farce. But it is also a story that can be told as a constitutional history of Britain in what was a formative period in its development, characterised not only by the union of the Anglo-Scottish crowns and parliaments, but also by the rise and fall of monarchical absolutism. All the more surprising therefore that it is a story that has been so seldom chronicled in full. And all the more welcome that a writer of Allan Massie s undoubted talents should rise to the challenge. Better known as a novelist, Massie s interest in history is long-standing and, like his fellow borderer Sir Walter Scott, with whom he clearly identifies, he possesses an encyclopaedic knowledge as well as intuitive understanding of the past. This he brings to bear to good effect in writing a pacy and often pungent narrative that brings the Stuarts individually to life while weaving around their dynastic story a broader history of Scotland before the union of 1603 and of Britain thereafter. Overall, though always readable, the book is weakest on Stuart kings like James III and James V, where Massie too readily falls back on stories culled verbatim from Scott s Tales of a Grandfather. It is at its best in dealing with Charles I and Charles II, where a compelling contrast between the two kings is developed in the context of civil war, interregnum and restoration. Perhaps inevitably these chapters are essentially Anglocentric, but the British dimension reasserts itself in the reigns of William and Anne during which the parliamentary union was effected and the old Stuart composite monarchy was transformed into the new British monarchical state. Only a diehard Whig would leave it at that, however, and Massie well knows that the dispossessed Stuarts continued to pose a very real threat long after the Glorious Revolution. Fittingly his story ends with a sprightly account of the Jacobite rebellions which, if notably free of Scott s sentimental romanticism, remains nonetheless sympathetic to the plight of the exiled Stuarts, acutely conscious of their royal heritage, but increasingly aware that their cause had little resonance beyond the faded glory of their residence the Palazzo Muti in Rome.

        "title": "King John and the French invasion of England",
        "content": "\"The whole land was covered with these limbs of the devil like locusts, who assembled to blot out everything from the face of the earth; for, running about with drawn swords and knives, they ransacked towns, houses, cemeteries, and churches, robbing everyone, sparing neither women nor children.\" Ad Thus wrote the contemporary chronicler Roger of Wendover, describing events in England during the winter of 1215 16.  These limbs of the devil  were the troops of King John, engaged in a bitter civil war at the very end of the monarch s reign. This war witnessed the emergence of Magna Carta; the death of King John; a French invasion of England that was almost a second Norman Conquest;  King  Louis I ruling one-third of England for a year; an English naval victory that ranks with the defeat of the Spanish Armada; and a major formative period in the emergence of English national identity. Oh, and it may even provide the prototype for Robin Hood. Despite all this, until now there has been no book dedicated to this dramatic course of events. In popular perception, John is  Bad King John , an impression reinforced with exuberance through decades of negative imagery on the screen. Whether in The Lion in Winter (1968), the BBC series Ivanhoe (1997), or the Robin Hood film starring Russell Crowe, John is portrayed as sly, cowardly, incompetent and completely reprehensible. Despite some attempts at historical revisionism, the popular hostile view remains essentially correct and actually reflects the views of John s contemporaries. William of Newburgh calls him  nature s enemy ; the Barnwell chronicler labels him  a pillager of his own people ; Richard of Devizes depicts him as a raging madman who  emitted foam from his mouth . Even sources from men fighting for John have little good to say of him. The Anonymous of B thune summed John up simply and damningly with  he had too many bad qualities . The rebellion that began in England in 1215 was a long time in gestation, and John was its feckless father. Crowned in 1199, and momentarily victorious over his enemies at Mirebeau (western France) in 1202, John captured and almost certainly murdered his teenaged nephew, Arthur of Brittany, and alienated powerful Norman lords by the harsh mistreatment of his prisoners. Worse still, his defence of his continental lands was fitful and ineffective. By June 1204, the French king, Philip Augustus, had conquered Normandy. Wendover hints that John, who had beaten a precipitous retreat to England, preferred  enjoying all the pleasures of life  with his barely teenaged bride, boasting that he had plenty of money to retake all that had been lost. However, it was the collection of this money that drained baronial incomes and fostered their discontent. The rest of John s reign was dominated by his attempts to win back his lost lands and lost pride. To this end, he put the screws on England. Royal income rose to an all-time high as John relentlessly pursued all sources of revenue, happily capitalising on a papal interdict imposed upon his kingdom (from 1208) to exploit the wealth of the church. More damaging was his treatment of the baronage. Infamously, in 1210 the chronicles unite in reporting that he had the wife and son of William de Briouze, a royal debtor, starved to death, probably in Windsor Castle. At court, his lecherous behaviour led to rumours and accusations that John was a serial seducer of barons  wives and daughters. Two of the rebellion s leaders, Robert fi tz Walter and Eustace de Vesci, offered this as a major reason for their revolt. It seemed that no one was safe from John s arbitrary rule. For his grand French campaign of the summer of 1214, John had exacted a record scutage. Scutage was a feudal relief by which barons paid money in lieu of military service to the crown. John had levied it so often (eleven times compared to Richard s three) that it now resembled a regular tax. It was the last straw. John had poured his huge resources into the campaign only to meet with complete failure in the summer. By September 1214, many barons simply refused to pay scutage. No one believed that John s military endeavours were worth investing in, a feeling readily expressed by the king s revealing contemporary nickname of  Softsword . In John s absence the barons had conspired to resist the king. John returned to England in October to face the greatest threat of his reign. Inconclusive talks between king and barons ran alongside military preparations. War was imminent. By May 1215 it had broken. The rebels, under the title of  the Army of God , mustered at Northampton and formally defied the king by breaking their homage and fealty. Of nearly 200 baronies in England, only some 40 declared for the rebels. However, only a similar number sided openly with the king; the majority simply stepped aside, not wishing to become embroiled in the conflict. Families were split in their loyalties: William Marshal, soon to be regent of England, stood by the king, while his eldest son opted for the rebels. John s main advantage was his string of some 150 royal castles across the country. The same month, the Army of God had their greatest success: they occupied the city of London, a vital power base that they held for over two years. Across the country, Lincoln, Northampton and Exeter also fell to them as they gained momentum and the political initiative. With the tide turning against him, John agreed to meet the rebels at Runnymede here, in mid-June, he sealed Magna Carta. Among its clauses, Magna Carta calls for a guarantee to all free men of protection from illegal imprisonment and seizure of property. It also demands access to swift justice, and, anticipating parliamentary assent for taxation, scutage limitations as agreed by a new  common council  of the realm. All are indictments of John s style of governance. The charter established a monitoring committee of 25 barons with a mandate to wage war on the king if he failed to uphold the agreement, something one historian has called  the most fantastic surrender of any English king to his subjects  But John was only buying time and never had any intention of honouring the charter. It proved but a temporary truce. By the time the war restarted in September, much had changed. The king had the backing of the pope, who denounced Magna Carta as  not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust  and now placed the rebels  lands under interdict. Meanwhile the rebels had sought a powerful new ally of their own: Prince Louis of France, heir to the French throne. With no disaffected royal family member with whom to join in common cause (John was the last of Henry II s sons), Louis, later known as the Lion, was the natural choice. His wife, Blanche of Castile, was a grand-daughter of Henry II. (Louis might actually have inherited the Angevin lands legally had John died without children.) He accepted the offer of the crown of England and promised help. This aid did not come soon enough to help the rebels besieged in Rochester Castle. Under the command of William d Albini, they held out against the might of John s concentrated forces for seven weeks. The Barnwell annalist declares that  living memory does not recall a siege so fiercely pressed or so staunchly resisted . A mine brought down one tower but it was starvation that forced the defenders  surrender.  In his anger,  says Wendover, John  ordered all the nobles to be hung , but was persuaded against this by a military adviser who warned of reprisals. A small advanced French force arrived in London in November, grumbling that the lack of wine meant that they had to drink English beer. Meanwhile, the rebels  ally in Scotland, King Alexander II, went on the warpath. At the end of December, John led his army on a ravaging expedition north, causing the devastation described in the opening quote. He burned Berwick before returning south, seemingly triumphant. Ralph Coggeshall writes of John s troops:  They made great slaughter, as they did everywhere they went . However London remained in rebel hands. Militarily and politically, John made a major mistake in avoiding dealing with the most serious threat. Louis was able to reinforce the London garrison and on 21 May he launched a full-scale invasion force, landing unopposed on the Isle of Thanet (in Kent). Rochester was quickly retaken, and royalist forces were pushed westwards as Louis took control of the south. Sensing the new momentum, leading royalist barons went over to the rebel side, including one of John s foremost generals, his half-brother William Longsword. Pockets of royalist resistance held out at Windsor, and, vitally, Dover. In the huge southern forest of the Weald, William of Kensham ( Willikin ) led bands of archers in guerrilla attacks on the French. But Louis and the rebels swiftly established control of about one-third of England. By the end of the summer, two-thirds of the baronage had declared for Louis. John dies, royalists rally Alexander II was able to progress from Scotland all the way to Dover where, in September, he paid homage to Louis, king of England in all but name. Just as it seemed England might be about to undergo a second foreign conquest 150 years after the fi rst in 1066, everything changed in a moment. On 19 October, having contracted dysentery, John performed his best service to the protection of the country: he died. This transformed the situation. The grievances against John could not be laid at the door of his unblemished heir, the nine-year-old Henry III. And so, under the protection of the elderly William Marshal as regent, the royalists rallied the English  to defend our land  against the French invaders, who had not helped their cause by their arrogant behaviour and expectations of landed spoils. Once again, the flow reversed to the royalists. A period of intermittent warfare and truces followed until the spring. On 20 May 1217, rebel and French forces were fi nally broken at the siege of Lincoln. Those who suffered in the war took their revenge on the French who attempted to flee back to London. Wendover records: Many of them, especially the foot-soldiers, were slain before they got to Louis; for the inhabitants of the towns through which they passed in their flight went to meet them with swords and clubs, and, laying ambushes for them, killed many. Hemmed up in London, the French now relied on reinforcements from France. These were dispatched in a major fleet that was met by an English naval force off Sandwich on 24 August. Displaying their superior skills, the English, using the wind direction to blind their enemies with lime dust, annihilated the French and beheaded their commander, the mercenary Eustace the Monk, on the deck of his flagship. It was the most important English naval victory until the Spanish Armada in 1588. On hearing of this defeat, Louis, says the Dunstable annalist, went mad with grief and rage and then,  destitute of present aid and despairing of the future , he sought peace terms. These were granted at Kingston on 12 September, marking the official ending of the war. Louis was back in France before the end of the month. Louis  involvement in the baronial revolt might well have led him to being crowned Louis I of England, but his luck ran out when John died. He was also hampered by the fact that he was a foreigner. Resentment of French troops in England grew throughout the course of the war   just as the barons had resented the presence of John s foreign mercenaries. As a result, England emerged with a strengthened sense of national identity. More importantly for its people, shocked by the impact of invasion, the rest of the century was to be relatively peaceful. The blame for the war itself can be fairly laid on John s incompetent shoulders. Contemporaries were certainly not inclined to exculpate him, as this rhyme demonstrates: With John s foul deeds England s whole realm is stinking, As Hell is, too, where he is now sinking. John s battles with the barons, French and Scots: a timeline June 1204: The French seize Normandy Philip Augustus of France s campaign to annex Normandy succeeds with the fall of Rouen. He also makes gains at John s expense in Anjou and Poitou. John s need to recover his landsleads to increasingly heavy taxation in England. July 1214: John s French campaign fails John s grand campaign in France collapses when his allies are defeated by Philip at Bouvines. John returns to England in October where baronial discontent has been heightened by a heavy scutage levy. May 1215: The barons revolt against John The barons, led by Robert fitz Walter, renounce their homage to the king. The revolt begins with military operations at Northampton. The rebels soon take London. June 1215: John agrees to sign Magna Carta John seals Magna Carta at Runnymede. A council of 25 barons is formed to monitor John s adherence to the agreement. December 1215: John ravages southern Scotland Alexander II of Scotland invades northern England. John leads a ravaging expedition north and sacks Berwick. 21 May 1216: A French army lands in Kent Prince Louis of France arrives in Kent with his main invasion force. Summer 1216: The siege of Dover begins Dover Castle was a crucial element in England s medieval defensive network. Matthew Paris called it,  The key to England . Prince Louis of France himself took personal charge of most of the military operations there, beginning the siege of royalist forces on in the summer of 1216. Drawing up his war engines, one of which was labelled  Evil Neighbour , he unleashed a heavy bombardment against the castle s walls, taking the north-western barbican and setting a mine. Dover was heavily garrisoned under the defiant leadership of Hubert de Burgh. The spirited defence pushed the French back, forcing them to withdraw their siege machines to a safer distance. Louis then applied psychological pressure by taunting the defenders with food, threatening starvation  to strike terror into them . With the defenders still defiant in October, Louis tried a new strategy: lifting the siege, he focused instead on  reducing the smaller castles throughout the country . Following a truce, Louis restarted a short siege on 12 May 1217. But on hearing of the major defeat of his forces on 20 May at Lincoln, he left for London. Dover s stand proved disastrous for Louis: it forced him to hold back troops from Lincoln and it provided a significant proportion of the fleet that defeated the French at Sandwich. 19 October 1216: John succumbs to dysentery Much of John s baggage train is lost in the Wash. John dies in Newark Castle and the nine-year-old Henry III is proclaimed king, with William Marshal acting as regent. 20 May 1217: The French are routed French and rebel forces are decisively defeated at Lincoln by William Marshal. French troops are attacked on their way back to their stronghold in London. 24 August 1217: The English destroy a French fleet The French fleet bringing reinforcements is comprehensively destroyed off Sandwich. Louis sues for peace. 12 September 1217: Louis leaves England The treaty of Kingston ends the war. An amnesty is declared for the rebels. Louis is paid 10,000 marks to quit England.

The wedding, a low-key affair, took the diplomatic community in London by surprise. Ad It was noted that  the king espoused the queen privately and without ceremony . The bridegroom was, however, enthusiastic as he took his vows  with a joyful countenance . Henry was 52 years old and ailing. His new wife, Katherine Parr, was not quite 31, twice-widowed and an experienced stepmother. Surely this was a marriage born of common sense, where passion would play little part? The Victorians depicted it as the union of an irascible tyrant with a worthy matron. The truth, however, was very different. Henry was looking for a wife, not a nurse or homemaker. He wanted a companion for his bed who might provide further heirs and could carry the role of queen consort impressively. Katherine, who had given up another man to marry the king, was well aware that her duties would definitely run to more than polite conversation and soothing the royal brow. Her determination to be a success led to a deep bond of affection between the royal couple which may, in 1546, have saved her life. It is not surprising that Henry was drawn to the comely widow. She was a slim, attractive redhead whose unimpeachable reputation hid a sensual nature. Her other suitor, Sir Thomas Seymour (the king s brother-in-law), had already realised this and probably Henry did, too. Until now, the curtains around the marriage bed of Henry VIII and his last wife have remained firmly closed. Yet theirs was undoubtedly a sexual relationship. Katherine took seriously her vows to be  bonaire and buxom in bed and in board . She took milk baths to keep her skin soft and the day after her wedding, she ordered  fine perfumes  for her bedchamber at Hampton Court. She was clearly determined to make her body and her bedchamber as enticing as possible. Henry lumbering into view in his nightshirt must have been a daunting sight. A year before his final marriage it had been noted that he was  already very stout and daily growing heavier  three of the biggest men to be found could get inside his doublet . Pain and the disease in his legs had left their mark on him. Between 1543 and 1545 he got through 300 pairs of hose a year. This was the man that Katherine had taken as her third husband. Very soon he doted on her   but could she possibly have loved him? At the outset, almost certainly not. She married him for the advancement of her family and because he could not be refused. She was dutiful and keen to convince herself that her fate was God s will. Yet Katherine was also a loving and optimistic woman, as well as intelligent. She knew the opportunity that had come her way and thought hard about how to turn it to her advantage. Developing a good relationship with all three of the royal children was certainly important but at the heart of Katherine s strategy was the king himself. Henry was not simply an overweight monster but a lonely and unhappy man after the disaster of his marriage to the foolish Catherine Howard. Katherine Parr recognised his need for love and attention. Circumstances permitted her to establish herself swiftly as a major influence in his life, as the plague kept them continuously outside the capital and in each other s company for six months. It was an ideal foundation for their relationship. So the king showered her with jewels and beautiful clothes, entrusted the country to her regency while he fought the French one last time in 1544, and greatly hoped for children with her. Henry and Katherine shared many interests, from hunting and archery to music, masques and books. She was a graceful dancer and they both loved the Venetian Bassano brothers, musicians patronised by Katherine. Henry, a cultured man, was delighted to have a queen who commanded respect from ambassadors and with whom he could discourse. Both husband and wife were committed to the 16th-century belief in lifelong learning. Katherine brushed up her Latin and also began to edit and write religious books, as her commitment to advancing the cause of further reform grew. In 1545 she became the first queen of England to be published when copies of her Prayers or Meditations were produced by the king s printers. Her influence over Henry seemed unshakeable. But in 1546, the last full year of the king s life, Katherine s position came under threat. Henry s health declined alarmingly and the negative attributes of his personality, his capriciousness, cunning and imperiousness, were amplified by the reluctant acknowledgement of his own mortality. A power struggle for the future of England was fought out over his diseased frame and his loyal wife, who had felt secure in his affection and returned it with devotion, found herself at the centre of the struggle. A bitter fight The story of plots against the queen was recounted dramatically by John Foxe nearly two decades later. By the time Foxe was writing, almost all of those who had been close to Katherine Parr were dead, so the detail cannot be verified. Katherine never spoke of such things herself. But it is certain that the bitter fight between the forces of religious reform and conservatism came close to Katherine. The ladies of her bedchamber were targeted in the search for banned books, and an outspoken reformer, Anne Askew, was tortured to get her to reveal links to those who served the queen. Anne was later burned at the stake without divulging anything. But Katherine hastily hid many items in her own book collection, changed locks on trunks and coffers and summoned her sick uncle to support her at this difficult time. Henry must have known his wife s views and interests. If Foxe is to be believed he found them progressively irritating, not so much for their content as for the fact that she presumed to contradict him in public. Nor had she conceived, and time was passing. Henry s tendency to become bored with his wives after a couple of years may also have been a factor. Yet whatever happened in the summer of 1546 did not destroy their marriage. Perhaps Henry did, as Foxe claimed, take a penitent Katherine on his knee and reassure her of his love. In fact, he seems to have been eager to make amends by ordering  all manner of jewels, pearls and precious stones  skins and sable furs  for our dearest wife, the queen . She, however, knew that her position had changed. After a second honeymoon in the autumn, they parted before Christmas. Henry needed to put his kingdom in order and prepare for death. There is no evidence that Katherine ever saw him again. Her New Year s gift to Prince Edward was a portrait of herself with his father, a telling clue that she hoped to cling on to the influence she had once enjoyed. Henry died on 28 January 1547. Katherine s hope that she would be made regent for the boy-king was dashed when Edward Seymour took power. In the spring of 1547 Katherine secretly wedded Edward s younger brother, Thomas, whom she certainly loved, though the pair hoped also to regain control of the royal children through their union. The marriage was stormy. Katherine suffered considerably during a difficult pregnancy as her husband flirted with Princess Elizabeth, who lived under her care. She died of childbed fever on 5 September 1548 after giving birth to her only child, a daughter. It was a tragic end for this remarkable woman, who had found that marriage to Henry VIII was perilous but brought great rewards. She set out to win his heart and amply succeeded.

        "title": "Lady Jane Grey: why do we want to believe the myth?",
        "content": "The teenage queen, Lady Jane Grey, has been mythologised, even fetishised, as the innocent victim of adult ambition. The legend was encapsulated by the French Romantic artist Paul Delaroche in his 1833 historical portrait of Jane in white on the scaffold, an image with all the erotic overtones of a virgin sacrifice. But the legend also inspired a fraud, one that has fooled historians, art experts, and biographers, for over 100 years. Ad A 16th-century merchant gave us what was believed, until now, to be the only detailed, contemporary description of Jane s appearance. In a letter, he wrote an eyewitness account of a smiling, red-haired girl, being processed to the Tower as queen, on 10 July 1553. He was close enough to see that she was so small she had to wear stacked shoes or  chopines  to give her height. Jane was overthrown nine days later, and, eventually, executed in the Tower from where she had reigned. But while the tragedy of her brutal death, at only 16, is real, the letter is an invention that obscures the significance of her reign. The faked letter first made its appearance in Richard Patrick Boyle Davey s 1909 biography The Nine Days Queen, Lady Jane Grey & her Times. Davey s subject was already a popular one. The Victorians had lapped up the poignant tale of a child-woman forced to be queen, and despite this, later executed as a usurper. The letter,  discovered  by Davey in the archives of Genoa, seemingly brought this tragic heroine to life. But in retrospect that should have sent alarm bells ringing, for the Jane the Victorians knew was already heavily fictionalised. The historical Jane was a great grandchild of Henry VII. Highly intelligent and given a top flight Protestant education, she might have made a queen consort to her fiercely Protestant cousin Edward VI, as her father hoped. But instead, on 6 July 1553, the dying Edward bequeathed her the throne, in place of his Catholic half sister, Mary Tudor. Mary overthrew Jane 13 days later, and she was duly tried for treason, found guilty and condemned. Mary indicated she wished to pardon Jane. But Jane was executed, nevertheless, the following year. It was the aftermath to a rebellion in which she had played no part (although her father had). Why then did Mary sign Jane s death warrant? The reason was indicated the day before Jane s beheading. The bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, reminded Mary it was leading Protestants who had opposed her rule in July 1553, and in the recent rebellion. Jane, who had condemned Catholicism as queen, had continued to do so as a prisoner in the Tower. As such she posed a threat. It was for her religious stance that Jane would die, not solely for her father s actions, or her reign as a usurper. Aware that the Protestant cause would be damaged by its link to treason, Jane reminded people from the scaffold that while in law she was a traitor, she had merely accepted the throne she was offered, and was innocent of having sought it. From this kernel of truth the later image of Jane was spun. Protestant propagandists developed her claims to innocence, ascribing the events of 1553 to the personal ambitions of Jane s father and father-in-law, rather than religion. Under Queen Elizabeth, treason was associated with Catholics, not Protestants, and the earlier history was forgotten. The religious issue of 1553 concluded only in 1701, when it was made illegal for any Catholic to inherit the throne: a law that still stands. But Jane s story continued to develop. Her  innocence  was associated increasingly with the passivity deemed appropriate in a young girl. The sexual dimension to this is evident in Edward s Young s 1714 poem, The Force of Religion, which invited men to gaze as voyeurs on the pure Jane in her  private closet . Jane s mother, Frances, meanwhile, was reinvented as a wicked queen to Jane s Snow White. By the 19th century Jane s fictionalised life was enormously popular. But there was something still missing from her story: a face. With no contemporary images or descriptions, the public had to be content with Jane as imagined by artists. The most striking work remains Paul Delaroche s portrait, The Execution of Lady Jane Grey, bequeathed to the nation by Lord Cheylesmore in 1902 (and now part of a major exhibition at the National Gallery). Jane, blindfold, and feeling for the block, represents an apotheosis of female helplessness. Richard Davey seems to have spotted a need for an account of Jane s appearance that matches its power. He claimed to have found it in a letter in Genoa, composed by the merchant,  Sir Baptist Spinola . The letter has been quoted in biographies ever since and used to argue the merits of  lost  portraits of Jane. But I was concerned that Davey was the sole source for this letter. Researching my triple biography, The Sisters Who Would be Queen, I had discovered that Davey had invented evidence that Jane had a nanny and dresser with her in the Tower: characters inspired by earlier novels. I began a long search for the  Spinola  letter, but never found it in Genoa or in any history predating 1909. And it became clear the letter is a fake that mixes details from contemporary sources with fiction. There was a contemporary merchant called Benedict Spinola and a soldier called Baptista Spinola. The description of Jane has echoes of the red-lipped girl in the Delaroche portrait, but resembles also a contemporary description of Mary Tudor, who was  of low stature  very thin; and her hair reddish . Jane s mother carries her train in the letter, as was observed in 1553. The platform shoes or  chopines  were taken from the Victorian historian Agnes Strickland, quoting Isaac D Israeli. I can find no earlier source. But they are suggestive of Jane s physical vulnerability: an element in the appeal of the abused child woman that remains so popular (we even find Jane raped in a recent novel). The rest of Jane s dress, described by Spinola as a gown of green velvet worn with a white headdress, was in colours traditionally worn by a monarch on the eve of their coronation. But they are also the colours of the illustration, Lady Jane Grey in Royal Robes, published in Ardern Holt s 1882 Fancy Dresses Described. Significantly, in Davey s The Tower of London, published in 1910, he describes Jane s dress as edged in ermine, as it was in Holt s illustration: a detail overlooked by  Sir Baptist Spinola . Davey s lies and the repetition of old myths are damaging. Because Jane s reign was treated for so long as the product of the ambitions of a few men, or of Edward VI s na ve hopes, it is regarded as a brief hiatus, of no consequence. But it is key to understanding the development of our constitutional history. And we have overlooked something else. The Tudor unease with women who hold power has never really gone away. In legend Jane is the good girl: weak and feminine; Frances is a bad woman: powerful and mannish. This is the lesson of the myths   one that historians have too willingly accepted.

        "content": "Reviewed by: Pauline Croft Author: Richard Rex Publisher: Amberley Price (RRP):  9.99 Ad First published in 2003, this short book provides a lively introduction to Elizabeth s reign. Rex sees the flattery of Elizabeth s courtiers as perpetuated too often by modern historians. He argues that she showed a sustained aversion to matrimony, coldly entering into marriage negotiations to enhance her prominence on the European stage. She is repeatedly castigated for making no provision for the succession, thereby ignoring her financial support for James VI after 1586 and their personal correspondence. Rex denounces her as crueller than her half-sister Mary (who burned more than 300 Protestants), since after the northern rebellion of 1569 70, some 450 men were executed, and from the 1580s, Catholic priests caught entering England clandestinely were hanged, drawn and quartered. He rejects the vital Tudor distinction between religious nonconformity, and rebellion or active sedition, since  the victims were just as dead . Readers may disagree but should enjoy this astringent assessment. Ad Pauline Croft is professor of early modern history, Royal Holloway, University of London",

        "title": "8 little-known prehistoric sites in Britain",
        "content": "Britain is blessed with some truly magnificent ancient sites. Every year tourists flock to the great megaliths of Stonehenge and Avebury in Wiltshire, the Callanish Stones in the Hebrides and Castlerigg in the Lake District. However, the prehistory in Britain goes back far longer and is far more diverse than these well-visited monuments may suggest. Author and explorer Dave Hamilton looks at some of the lesser-known ancient sites around Britain; from a Palaeolithic cave burial and an ancient axe-polishing stone to a towering broch and site of prehistoric rock art. Ad King Arthur s Hall, St Breward, Cornwall In a desolate, windswept corner of Bodmin Moor, in the shadow of Cornwall s highest peaks, an unusual rectangular configuration of 56 stones set in a manmade bank of earth lies open to the elements. The site has been known as King Arthur s Hall since the 16th century but it is doubtful it ever had anything to do with any figure connected to the legendary monarch. It is thought there were once up to 140 stones, first erected in the Neolithic period   although beyond that, its purpose remains a mystery. It has been suggested it might have been a meeting point for tribal elders, who would gather within the rectangular interior of the upright stones. Similar sites in France and Ireland were used for cremation and it is possible King Arthur s Hall served the same function. However, there is no direct archaeological evidence to back this claim. Some have even suggested that it is not Neolithic at all but a medieval cattle enclosure. Read more | Stonehenge: a prehistoric tourist trap The consensus seems to be that it is at least 4,500 years old and probably served some sort of ritual purpose   although this is often shorthand for  we don t really know ! It does seem to be one small piece of a larger landscape of sites, with associated stone circles; cists (stone coffin or burial chamber) and monoliths dotted around the surrounding moor. The climate on the moor can be unforgiving, so the centre of the site is often flooded and boggy. Nevertheless it is a magical place to visit and quite unlike any other ancient monument in the country. The site has been known as King Arthur s Hall since the 16th century. (Image by Alamy) The Grey Wethers and the Polisher Stone, Avebury, Wiltshire On Fyfield Down, just off the Ridgeway path near Avebury in Wiltshire, there is a large field containing hundreds of glacial deposited stones. It is a spectacular site, often known as the Grey Wethers (but also known as Mother s Jam), as from a distance the grey sarsen stones resemble countless grazing sheep. Not to be confused with the Dartmoor stone circle of the same name, these rocks provided easily accessible building material for the Neolithic people who erected the great stone circles of Avebury and the Long barrow at West Kennet. Among the deposited sarsens, one stone particularly stands out (if you can find it!): the  Polisher Stone . A series of grooves were carved into this recumbent stone by generations of people polishing their stone axes. Stones marked in this way are a common sight in France but are much rarer in Britain. Polished axes were traded throughout ancient Britain and it is thought most were never used for cutting down trees or any other practical purpose. Instead, current thinking is they were both a status symbol for Neolithic man (akin to the modern-day Swiss watch), and an item of ritualistic practice, perhaps like a ceremonial mace. From a distance the grey sarsen stones resemble countless grazing sheep. (Image by Alamy) Although we will never know for certain, the Polisher Stone s proximity to the ancient Ridgeway path might suggest the rock formed part of a ritualised walk toward the end of the pilgrimage to Avebury during the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age. Look for the stone on the hill between the main field of Sarsens and the Ridgeway path, or see my book, Wild Ruins B.C. (Wild Things Publishing, 2019) for more detailed instructions. Paviland Cave, Gower, South Wales Around 33,000 years ago the body of a man was placed into a cave that overlooked a vast, flat plain of grazing mammoths, deer and antelope. Around his neck were shell necklaces and on his wrists were rings made from mammoth bone. The funeral party may have covered his body with red ochre, or he may have been laid to rest in clothing dyed with the pigment. The man would have been in his 20s and, although perhaps a little larger, physically he would have been no different to you or me. He was part of an upper-Palaeolithic group of people known as Cro-Magnons   modern humans, who followed on from, and perhaps crossed over with, Neanderthals, appearing in Europe 40,000 years ago. Significantly, he was buried with grave goods and a mammoth skull was placed, like a headstone, above the body, making this the oldest ritualised burial ever found in Britain. We cannot know how the man died but the presence of the ochre and jewellery, along with the mammoth skull, have led some to believe he was either a shaman or celebrated hunter. A view looking out of the Paviland Cave, Gower Peninsula, Wales. (Image by Alamy) Thousands of years later, long after his body had decomposed, the ochre remained, staining his bones red. In 1823 the remains were discovered by the theologian and geologist William Buckland. The staining of the bones along with its proximity to a Roman camp, led him to believe these were the bones of a female, Roman-era prostitute, living in isolation to solicit her trade. With a belief system centred around the teachings of the Bible, much like his peers at the time, Buckland simply could not have contemplated the true age of the skeleton. To further fit this view, he suggested the  woman s  mammoth bone jewellery was fossilised ivory dug up by her kinsmen. Because of this gender confusion and the red-stained bones, he came to be known as 'The Red Lady of Paviland'. Read more about life in the Iron Age Sea levels are much higher today than they were in Palaeolithic and the cave now stands on the shores of the Gower Peninsula. Although the cave is well documented, it can be difficult to find and is a treacherous place to get to. A visit needs to be timed with the retreating tides, as many have found themselves cut off from land, forced to spend the night in the cave! Thornborough Henges, near Thornborough, North Yorkshire A series of three, 240-metre diameter henge circles, 1,000 paces apart, the Thornborough Henges would have been constructed with nothing more than antler and bone tools and signifies many thousands of hours of labour. The central henge of the three would have been covered in gypsum, which glowed a brilliant white both in daylight and under the glow of the full moon. As with all Neolithic sites, we cannot know its true purpose, but it is thought to have astrological significance, being linked with the rising of Orion s Belt in the night sky. This may have seen the henge (or henges) used for ceremonies during key times of the year. Whatever its purpose, it did not sit alone in the landscape. An associated cursus (or large dug out), ceremonial walkway and six henge circles have also been found in the local area, along with countless burial mounds. Such is the extent of the site, it must have rivalled Stonehenge for its importance to the people of the Neolithic period and it is likely people came to visit from far and wide. Two of the henge circles are found on open grassland with a third   the most atmospheric   now hidden amongst a large grove of trees. Midhowe Broch, Orkney Islands, Scotland The Scottish brochs were large towers thought to have once housed elite tribesmen along with their families, and perhaps even their animals. Situated mostly in the north of mainland Scotland   the Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetlands   they look like modern-day cooling towers. Midhowe itself is one of many brochs densely packed on the shores of Eynhallow Sound   the stretch of water which separates the island of Rousay from Orkney mainland. Its strategic location and the presence of holes, through which spears can be thrust, suggests it was used for defensive purposes. However, just as with the hillforts to the south, these may have been used as a mark of status or a show of power, rather than serving solely as a stronghold. The completeness of Midhowe Broch gives a remarkable insight into life during the Scottish Iron Age. (Image by Alamy) Despite the remote, northern location of Midhowe, Roman artefacts have been found on the site, suggesting direct or indirect trading links with the Roman Empire. Around a third of the defensive wall still stands, along with stairs; proposed kennels for guard dogs either side of the entrance; flagstone furniture and even a working water cistern. The completeness of the broch gives a remarkable insight into life during the Scottish Iron Age. Ballochmyle rock art, Scotland Tucked away in a small woodland, just off the river Ayr, about 10 miles due east of Prestwick and 25 miles southwest of Glasgow, lies one of the most enigmatic prehistoric sites in Britain. Etched into a large outcrop of red sandstone are some of the most extensive examples of rock art made by a pre-Christian civilisation found in Britain. Thought to date to the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age, the markings are referred to as  cup and ring marks , as they often show a series of rings emanating from a cup-like indentation. They can be found elsewhere in Scotland, Northern England, Ireland and continental Europe, with similar markings also found in Australia and Mesoamerica. During the Neolithic and early Bronze Age, rivers would have been an important way to navigate through a sometimes densely-populated area. The proximity of the Ballochmyle rock art to the river therefore could suggest these were way-markers or etchings made to appease the river gods to grant their safe passage. Others say they could have been signposts for lost travellers, star-charts, or even an ancient form of writing. The Devil s Ring and Finger, Midlands, England It is rare to find Neolithic monuments of any kind in the Midlands, let alone one like the Devil s Ring and Finger. It is one of only a handful of circular stones found in Britain and Ireland. It contains perhaps the largest carved hole of any prehistoric monument in the country, much larger than the far more famous M n-an-Tol in Cornwall. However, unlike its Cornish counterpart, the Devil s Ring and Finger has only one, rather than two associated monoliths, in addition to the circular stone   hence the name ring and finger. However, as the monument was removed from its original site some time in antiquity to make way for the plough, we can never really know what the original configuration looked like, or indeed what it was for. It has been suggested that it may have been part of a stone circle or the only surviving part of a chambered tomb, much like Cotswold Severn family tombs south of the site. The monument now lies on the edge of a farmer s field and in all but the winter months is almost completely obscured from view by a small copse of trees and crop growth. The present owner of the farm tolerates walkers visiting the site   as long as they respect his crops and livestock by sticking to the field boundary. Borvemore, Isle of Harris, Scotland Also known as Scarista, the Borvemore standing stone sits on a wild, windswept, Hebridean headland between two long, often deserted, white sandy beaches. Below the stone, the azure blue waters which wash onto the beach are some of the most unpolluted in the world. At times, if it wasn t for the changeable climate, you could be fooled into thinking you were in the Seychelles rather than Scotland. It is likely that the stone was not erected as a monolith, and was instead part of a larger stone circle. There are signs of others in the area and it may be that Borvemore was once part of a much larger ritualist landscape. We know from climate surveys that when the stone was erected the weather was far more favourable than it is today. With this in mind, it is not difficult to see why ancient people would have favoured a life on these idyllic islands.

Whether the charges against her were justified is a question that has divided historians ever since. Anne stood accused of betraying Henry VIII with not just one, but five lovers, including her own brother, George Boleyn. Ad Henry apparently had little trouble in believing the rumours, but was there any truth behind them? Almost certainly not. Although Anne was a notorious flirt and loved to surround herself with attractive male courtiers, she was far too intelligent, shrewd and ambitious to risk throwing away everything that she had striven for during the long years of her courtship with Henry VIII. Her downfall was more likely due to the machinations of her enemies, in particular Thomas Cromwell, who quietly gathered  evidence  of her misdemeanours. And by 1536, after just three years of marriage, his royal master was already itching to be rid of the wife with whom he had been so besotted. It seems the thrill had been in the chase, and once Henry married   and bedded   Anne, he soon began to lose interest. Anne had also failed to give him the one thing he needed above all else: a son. The birth of a daughter (the future Elizabeth I) in September 1533 had been a crushing disappointment, and when Anne then suffered a series of miscarriages, Henry became convinced that their marriage had displeased God. Cromwell gave him the perfect escape clause. Ad Answered by: Tracy Borman, author of Matilda: Queen of the Conqueror (Jonathan Cape, 2011)",

        "title": "The Thames triumphant: royal parties on London's grandest street",
        "content": "This article was first published in the May 2012 issue of BBC History Magazine Ad On Sunday 3 June 2012, the celebrations of the Queen s diamond jubilee will culminate in a spectacular pageant on the Thames. Hundreds of vessels will take part in a massive procession, journeying down the river from Hammersmith to Greenwich. Ranging from a new royal barge and the little ships of Dunkirk to steamboats and a host of pleasure craft, the pageant is designed to embody symbols of nation and Commonwealth to mark this most historic occasion. Only once before in British history has a monarch achieved such an anniversary and that was Queen Victoria 115 years ago. But why will Britain celebrate the jubilee with a flotilla on the river rather than the more familiar marching bands, horse-drawn carriages and parade along the Mall? The answer lies, in part, with the long royal association with, and use of, the Thames. By the Tudor period, the Thames was the most convenient means of communication between a series of major riverside residences: Windsor, Hampton Court, Richmond, Westminster, Whitehall and Greenwich. It was also London s grandest  street , providing a majestic processional route for great royal, state and civic occasions. This was a role that none of the capital s narrow, crowded and rather mean highways could fulfil. During the reign of Henry VIII, the river witnessed a series of highly symbolic river processions. Three days before her coronation on 1 June 1533, Anne Boleyn left Greenwich Palace by barge in a fantastical river procession with an accompanying theatrical pageant organised around the theme of St George. A small barge led the parade carrying a mechanical dragon, which  pranced about furiously, twisting its tail and belching out wildfire . Henry commanded the lord mayor and the livery companies of the City of London to attend. Thomas Cramner, archbishop of Canterbury, reported that their barges were  decked after the most gorgeous and sumptuous manner , flying colourful flags and pennants. Guns saluted and musicians played as the heavily pregnant Anne, dressed in virginal white, was conveyed to the Tower of London in her  rich barge among her nobles . At the Tower she was met by Henry, who, in a very public display of affection, kissed his new bride. Anne later travelled to Westminster Abbey by road, while Henry went by river through his capital. Divisive issue These processions were, of course, stage-managed events allowing the public to demonstrate its loyalty to the king. But the coronation was not a straightforward affair. The annulment of Henry s marriage to Catherine of Aragon was a highly divisive issue and Anne was far from popular. The pageantry was, therefore, designed to lend legitimacy to the king s controversial new wife. The use of the broad and open expanse of the river allowed the maximum number of people to witness the event, and the involvement of the City of London and the nobility added further authority. Controversial marriages also posed difficulties for the Stuart monarchs. Once more, river processions provided an answer. Catherine of Braganza, queen consort to Charles II, had twin  disadvantages : she was foreign and a Roman Catholic. After her marriage to Charles in Portsmouth, she too made a grand state entry into London. Her  Aqua Triumphalis , a truly monumental pageant, was held on the Thames between Hampton Court and Whitehall on 23 August 1662. The writer John Evelyn was on the river:  I was spectator of the most magnificent triumph that ever floated on the Thames, considering the innumerable boates and vessells, dress d and adorn d with all imaginable pomp, but above all the thrones, arches, pageants, and other representations, stately barges of the Lord Maior and Companies, with various inventions, musiq and peales of ordnance from both ye vessells and the shore going to meete and conduct the Queene from Hampton Court to White-hall, at the first time of her coming to towne.  Samuel Pepys, who could not get a boat despite offering eight shillings, watched from the Banqueting House at Whitehall. He recorded in his diary that  the King and Queene [were] in a barge under a Canopy with 10,000 barges and boats I think, for we could see no water for them . But the real focus of Pepys s attention appears to have been Lady Castlemayne:  I glutted myself with looking on her.  Perhaps one of the strangest royal river processions took place on 4 April 1865, when the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, travelled down the Thames from Westminster to Crossness, then in north Kent. His purpose was the opening of the Crossness sewage pumping station, a major component of Joseph Bazalgette s massive scheme to improve London s sanitation. The event was attended by numerous influential guests, including the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London. The Prince of Wales officially switched on the four great sewage pumping engines, each of which was named after a member of the royal family: Victoria, Prince Consort, Albert Edward and Alexandra. Having declared open this  perfect shrine of machinery , the prince and the assembled dignitaries sat down to lunch in one of the outbuildings. The Victorian Thames was, however, very different from the pleasant river that played host to earlier spectacles. It was now urban, industrial, polluted and much altered by new bridges and the embankments. Consequently, its ceremonial use ebbed away. But one constant connecting late medieval London to the mid-Victorian metropolis was the Lord Mayor s Day procession, which took place on the Thames from 1453 until 1856. Each autumn, the newly elected mayor travelled, in a gilded barge accompanied by the great livery companies, from the City of London to be sworn in at the Exchequer Court in Westminster. This annual pageant was a symbolic display of the city s allegiance to the crown. It was also a boisterous demonstration of wealth and commercial power. This piece of theatre was captured most famously by Canaletto, whose paintings of the occasion show that it was both a solemn affair and a popular celebration. And it is Canaletto s extraordinary depictions that have inspired this year s royal river pageant. This summer, the Thames will return triumphantly to the centre of national life as the stage for the climax of the diamond jubilee, regaining once more its rightful and historic place as London s grandest street.

        "title": "Philip of Spain, King of England: The Forgotten Sovereign",
        "content": "Reviewed by: John Edwards Author: Harry Kelsey Publisher: IB Tauris Price (RRP):  18.99 Ad In recent years, some historians have begun to look again at the character and reign of Henry VIII s eldest daughter, Mary. As a result she is beginning at last to be given her proper title, Mary I not  Mary Tudor . And the religious persecution that led to her label  Bloody    which she did not in fact acquire until the 18th century   is being explained properly, though not excused. Yet, while she has always received detailed biographical treatment, her husband, Philip of Spain, has rarely been included in the picture. Just as Mary is not normally acknowledged as queen of Spain, which she was from 1556 to 1558, so even Spanish biographers of Philip tend to gloss over his time as king of England. Glyn Redworth and Henry Kamen are exceptions to this rule, and now Harry Kelsey, a biographer of Elizabethan sea-dogs Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins, has devoted a book to their Spanish adversary. Kelsey writes elegantly and in a lively way, and his account of Philip s connection with England is based on a wide range of manuscripts and printed sources, from England, Spain and elsewhere. Until he arrives at the couple s marriage, in Winchester Cathedral on 25 July 1554, he uses alternating chapters to outline the biographies, and particularly the academic and political education, of Mary and Philip respectively. While there are voluminous sources for Mary s life and reign, as is the case with all English sovereigns, it has traditionally been noted that much of the documentation of Philip s activities, from 1554, were lost at sea when the king was returning from the Netherlands to Spain in 1559. This has been the customary excuse for not giving proper attention to Philip I of England, even though a significant amount of useful material still survives in European archives. Yet there is in this book a curious lack of connection between the voluminous sources on which the book is based and the story that the reader is actually told. Kelsey seems most interested in personalities, including a particular stress on physical appearance. This is fine in itself, as 16th-century monarchs were just as interested as modern political leaders in the dark arts of spin, but it should have been balanced by a greater concentration on the European political context of Mary and Philip s day. Certain activities at court in Whitehall, particularly the Spanish war exercise known as the  cane-game  (juego de ca as) are given detailed treatment, while major issues confronting England and continental Europe are often mentioned only briefly. In particular, the role of religion, which was perhaps the most important thing to both king and queen as they struggled to defend Roman Catholicism against the Reformation, is referred to but never properly explained. Spanish sources do, however, exist, though not used here, to reveal a deep involvement of Philip and his Spanish ecclesiastical advisers in the notorious burning in Mary s reign of nearly 300 people, because of their Protestant belief. This is an enjoyable read, then, but a strangely unsatisfying one, and a fuller account of Philip s brief English reign is still needed.

        "content": "Ad 18 January 1486: Henry VII and Elizabeth of York The Wars of the Roses ended and the Tudor dynasty began with one of the most popular royal weddings in history. After Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, defeated King Richard III at the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, he claimed the English throne. As Henry VII consolidated his power, he received frequent reminders of his 1483 public oath to marry Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV and niece of Richard III. On 10 December 1485, Speaker of the House Sir Thomas Lovell praised Henry s plans to marry Elizabeth  as consolation to the entire kingdom . The members of parliament agreed and  thereupon, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in that same parliament, rising from their seats, and standing before the King seated on his royal throne, bowed their heads, made the same request with lowered voice: to whom the King indeed responded with his own voice,  According to their desires and requests, he himself was equally pleased to proceed . The wedding ceremony took place at Westminster Abbey, followed by a banquet at Westminster Hall. Elizabeth of York acquired sumptuous gowns in blue, purple and tawny colours around the time of her wedding and one of these may have been her wedding dress. Henry and Elizabeth s eldest son, Prince Arthur, was born eight months later, on 19 September 1486. Francis Bacon described Arthur as \"born in the eighth month, as the physicians do prejudge , yet \"strong and able\". It is possible that the infant was conceived before the wedding, as a formal betrothal was considered almost as binding as a marriage at that time. The final scene of Shakespeare s Richard III immortalised Tudor hopes for the marriage to result in lasting peace and prosperity for England:  O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,/The true succeeders of each royal house,/By God s fair ordinance conjoin together,/And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so./Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace.

English Protestants feared that Philip would bring the Spanish inquisition with him and involve England in Spain s continental wars. As a Roman Catholic and a daughter of King Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, Mary was favourably disposed toward Spain and regarded her cousin Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain, as a father figure. So when Charles proposed that Mary marry his son and heir, the future Philip II, Mary was delighted to accept, especially after she saw a handsome portrait of her future husband. Parliament attempted to persuade Mary to marry an Englishman and when that failed, passed the Queen Mary s Marriage Act to limit Philip s powers in England. Despite the opposition to the marriage, Mary and Philip had a lavish royal wedding that reflected their status as reigning monarchs (Charles V had declared his son Philip king of Naples and Sicily in time for the ceremony so that he would not be outranked by his bride). The wedding took place at Winchester Cathedral. Contemporary accounts record that the cathedral was  richly hanged with arras and cloth of gold . Mary wore a purple satin wedding dress embroidered with pearls, while Philip was  richly apparelled in cloth of gold . The ceremony was followed by a banquet at the Bishop of Winchester s palace and also dancing. Philip and his Spanish courtiers were reportedly  out of countenance  because the English courtiers were better dancers. The lavish wedding was followed by the longest royal baby watch in English history. Mary displayed signs of what appeared to be pregnancy in July 1554. She went into seclusion expecting an imminent birth in April 1555 and there were repeated false rumours and premature celebrations that she had given birth to a son. In July 1555, Mary emerged from seclusion without having given birth. The marriage remained childless. Instead of a pregnancy, Mary had likely experienced symptoms of ovarian cancer. She died on 17 November 1558, possibly from cancer. A portrait of Philip II, king of Spain from 1556, and Queen Mary I of England.

Charles s father, James VI and I, who died in 1625, had hoped that a Roman Catholic princess from a major European power such as France or Spain would bring a large dowry to her marriage with his son. James s wish came to pass: the wedding ceremony of Charles and Henrietta Maria took place in Paris in front of Notre Dame cathedral, according to the French protocol established for the wedding of the Protestant future king Henry IV of France and Roman Catholic Marguerite de Valois in 1572. This precedent was an unhappy one, because the St Bartholomew s Day massacre of Protestants by Catholics followed the wedding of Henry and Marguerite. The marriage was eventually annulled, as the couple were childless and Henry was determined to remarry and father heirs. There were few English guests at the wedding of Charles and Henrietta Maria. In fact, even the groom himself stayed away: Charles was represented by a proxy, the Protestant Duke of Chevreuse. Charles had visited Paris and glimpsed Henrietta Maria on a previous occasion, en route to Spain, but would have been reluctant to participate in a French royal wedding that included Roman Catholic rites. The wedding breakfast took place at the Archbishop of Paris s residence followed by further festivities at the Louvre. Charles and Henrietta Maria met six weeks after their wedding, when the bride, escorted by the Duke of Buckingham, arrived in England with her household. The marriage was consummated in Canterbury, the first major stop on the bridal party s journey from Dover to London. One of Charles s grooms of the bedchamber wrote to his wife on 14 June:  This last night the king and queene did lie together here att Conterburie, Long maye they do soe, and haue as manie children as wee are like to haue.  Charles and Henrietta Maria would have nine children, but only two sons   the future kings Charles II and James VII and II   would outlive Henrietta Maria. The intense public interest in Charles and Henrietta Maria s contentious royal wedding resulted in the publication of printed pamphlets discussing the event from a variety of perspectives. The clauses of the marriage contract were available for readers interested in the political and religious implications of the match, which included freedom of worship for the bride and control over the upbringing of her children until the age of 13. There were also detailed accounts of the ceremony, the order of precedence and what everyone wore. One pamphlet, titled The Solemnization of the Marriage of the King of Great Britaine, stated:  Then came the King of France, in a garment all embroidered with Gold and Silver, with the Lady his Sister in his right hand, who had a crown upon her head, and her Gown powdered all over with [fleurs-de-lys] of Gold.  Henrietta Maria chose a deep blue wedding dress that set off the fleurs-de-lys, the emblem of the French royal house. Charles and Henrietta Maria developed a strong personal bond but the marriage remained unpopular. Henrietta Maria was eventually impeached as queen by the House of Commons in 1643 during the Civil War, on eight charges including inciting the Irish to revolt and pawning crown jewels to pay royalist mercenaries. Charles was beheaded in 1649. Henrietta Maria died in 1669. 10 February 1840: Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha As a reigning queen, Queen Victoria was obliged to propose to Prince Albert in reverse of the usual custom of the time, but she was determined to ensure that her wedding ceremony would mirror the experiences of other British women. When asked if she wanted the word  obey  included in the vows, Victoria stated that  it was her wish to be married in all respects like any other woman, according to the revered usages of the Church of England, and that, though not as a queen, as a woman she was ready to promise all things contained in that portion of Liturgy . A royal bride would not omit the word  obey  from the vows until the wedding of one of Victoria s great-granddaughters, Lady May Cambridge, in 1931. The wedding of Victoria and Albert took place in the Chapel Royal at St James s Palace. In contrast to previous royal brides, who had usually worn sumptuous coloured materials embroidered with gold or silver for their wedding dresses, Victoria chose a comparatively simple white silk dress adorned with Honiton lace and orange blossoms. The style was imitated by other brides, beginning a fashion for white wedding dresses that continues to the present day. As a young princess, Victoria had toured Britain, including industrial towns, with her mother, and the plans for her wedding dress were intended to benefit British manufacturing. The silk was woven in Spitalfields, whose silk industry was experiencing a decline, while the lace came from the villages of Honiton and Beer in Devon. Victoria wore her wedding lace on special occasions for the rest of her life and was buried in her veil in 1901. Victoria s journal demonstrated a keen awareness of the public interest in her wedding. She wrote:  I never saw such crowds as there were in the Park, & they cheered most enthusiastically.  Newspapers covered all aspects of the ceremony and festivities. The wedding breakfast took place at Buckingham Palace and included a plum cake that weighed 300 pounds (a slice of the cake was sold at auction in 2016 for  1,500). But Victoria s taste in cakes changed a few years into her marriage. The invention of baking powder in 1843 allowed cakes to rise higher than previously possible, and Victoria enjoyed this new sponge cake with her afternoon tea. Her new favourite dessert became known as Victoria sponge cake. Victoria was delighted with Albert but she was determined to place her duties as queen above all personal considerations. She insisted on just a three-day honeymoon at Windsor Castle, so that she would not fall behind on state business.

(Photo by Rischgitz/Getty Images) 10 March 1863: The future King Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark The first royal wedding to take place at St George s Chapel, Windsor Castle   the venue chosen by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018   was the marriage of Queen Victoria s eldest son, Prince Albert Edward (the future Edward VII) and Princess Alexandra of Denmark. After generations of German princes and princesses marrying into the royal family, the arrival of a Danish princess captured the popular imagination and Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote a poem welcoming  the Sea King s Daughter  as a  joy to the people and joy to the throne . Alexandra wore white silk trimmed with Honiton lace and embroidered with roses, thistles and shamrocks to symbolise England, Scotland and Ireland. While the bride was admired for her beauty, fashion sense and unpretentious manner, Queen Victoria s choice of St George s Chapel as the setting for her heir s wedding attracted widespread criticism because of its comparatively small size and its location outside London. Victoria was in mourning for Prince Albert, who had died of typhoid fever in 1861, and wished to avoid appearing in public in the capital. At St George s Chapel she could watch the ceremony from the seclusion of Catherine of Aragon s closet   a private recessed balcony above the altar that had allowed Catherine to watch Order of the Garter ceremonies without being observed. Victoria also wrote the guest list, which consisted of the royal household, royal relatives and political figures, all required to wear half mourning colours of grey, lilac and white. The groom was permitted to invite four friends while the bride s side was restricted to her immediate family. Only 38 people were invited to attend the luncheon that followed the ceremony, which Queen Victoria herself did not attend (she instead dined privately with her youngest daughter, Beatrice). Victoria considered a large wedding reception to be inappropriate during her mourning for Albert. The other 500 wedding guests returned to London after the ceremony aboard an overcrowded train from Windsor station. 20 November 1947: The future Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh The wedding of Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, RN (born Prince Philip of Greece) balanced royal ceremonial with postwar austerity. The ceremony took place at Westminster Abbey, which had been revived as a popular setting for royal weddings after the First World War. The couple posed for official engagement photos that displayed Elizabeth s engagement ring, which was designed by Philip with jewels that had belonged to his mother, Alice of Battenberg. With this engagement ring, Philip set a precedent that would be followed by his grandson, Prince Harry, who would design a ring for his fianc  Meghan Markle including diamonds that belonged to his late mother, Princess Diana. At the time of Elizabeth and Philip s wedding, food and clothing rationing was still in effect. The British government provided Elizabeth with the 300 clothing coupons necessary for her ivory silk wedding dress, adorned with 10,000 pearls embroidered into white rose of York designs and crystals arranged as ears of corn. One of the bridesmaids, Elizabeth s cousin Margaret Rhodes, recalled:  There was rationing of course, and we used up all our clothes coupons.  The wedding breakfast featured partridges, which were not subject to rationing. The widespread perception that food was scarce in Britain, however, resulted in members of the public in the Commonwealth and the United States sending tinned food to Buckingham Palace. The government of the Australian state of Queensland sent the royal couple 500 crates of tinned pineapple as a wedding gift. Both the bride and groom had relatives who were left off the guest list because of personal and political considerations. Elizabeth s uncle, the former King Edward VIII, whose abdication to marry Wallis Simpson had led to the unexpected accession of Elizabeth s father as King George VI, was not invited. Philip had three surviving sisters in 1947 who had married German princes, some of whom had been involved with the Nazi party. These sisters and their husbands were also not extended invitations to the wedding, and Philip s family was represented by his Mountbatten relatives on his mother s side. Philip s cousin David Mountbatten was his supporter, and another cousin, Pamela Mountbatten, was a bridesmaid. Pamela recalled that when the wedding party appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace:  We were met by an incredible sight: the police had been holding everyone back around the Victoria Memorial but when we came out, they let them go and we could see   and hear   a sea of people surging forward. Every time the newlyweds waved, the volume of cheering increased. We were later told that while they were waiting the crowd had been singing  All the Nice Girls Love a Sailor .

The young Lady Diana Spencer captured the popular imagination as  Shy Di  , posing for photographs with Charles but evading questions about her relationship with him. The wedding was a global television sensation, with more than 750 million viewers around the world watching the ceremony. Some 600,000 people lined the procession route to catch a glimpse of the royal couple on their wedding day. The wedding took place at St Paul s Cathedral in London and was attended by 2,700 guests. Political considerations affected the guest list because Charles s status as heir to the throne made his wedding a state occasion. In addition to Commonwealth governors-general and heads of government, European royals and political leaders were also invited to the wedding. A few invitations were declined for political reasons: King Juan Carlos of Spain made headlines around the world when he stated that he and his wife, Queen Sofia, would not attend the wedding because Charles and Diana would be boarding the Royal Yacht Britannia in Gibraltar for their honeymoon. Spain had ceded Gibraltar to Britain according to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, but 20th-century Spanish leaders disputed Britain s claim to this overseas territory. The Spanish royal family were not the only absent invitees. The president of Greece, Konstantinos Karamanlis, also declined his invitation because Charles s second cousin, former King Constantine II of Greece, had been invited as  King of the Hellenes . In 1974, Karamanlis s government had held a referendum that confirmed the abolition of the Greek monarchy and the establishment of a republic. The president of Ireland also declined to attend the wedding. Diana wore a silk taffeta and antique lace wedding dress   designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel  with puffed sleeves and a full skirt. The glass coach that transported Diana and her father to St Paul s Cathedral was not large enough to accommodate the 25-foot train   bridesmaid India Hicks (the daughter of Pamela Mountbatten) recalled  trying as best as I could to de-wrinkle the situation  as Diana stepped out of the carriage to enter the cathedral. The dress set a trend for elaborate wedding dresses that continued throughout the 1980s. Charles and Diana separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996. Diana died in a car accident in Paris in 1997.

William was the first direct heir to the throne to marry a bride from a middle-class background since the future King James VII and II married Anne Hyde in 1660. In contrast to previous royal couples, who had experienced comparatively brief courtships and engagements, William and Catherine had met in university and been in a relationship for years before announcing their engagement. Catherine had gradually become familiar to the public as William s girlfriend   though William never made a public statement to that effect, in the same manner as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The wedding took place at Westminster Abbey, which the couple customised with English maple trees along the aisle that were replanted at Prince Charles s Highgrove Estate after the ceremony. Catherine wore an ivory satin dress with lace appliqu  designed by Sarah Burton, the creative director at the Alexander McQueen fashion house. The style was compared to past wedding gowns including those of Queen Victoria, Queen Elizabeth II and Grace Kelly, who married Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956. William and Catherine had a maid of honour, the bride s sister Pippa Middleton, and a best man, Prince Harry, in addition to young bridesmaids and page boys. While previous royal couples expected (and sometimes displayed) a wide variety of gifts, William and Catherine encouraged well-wishers to donate to one of a recommended list of charities. This raised the profile of charity gift registries as an option for other couples and set a trend for subsequent royal couples, including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The wedding of William and Catherine was credited with increasing interest in the monarchy among younger people   a trend that continues with the wedding of Harry and Meghan.

Answered by historian Lauren Mackay One could be forgiven for assuming Henry had notoriously bad luck when it came to marriage, but in truth it was his desire for a male son and heir to the Tudor dynasty that was the driving force behind most of his marital decisions. This, coupled with Henry s infatuation with Anne Boleyn, was behind his desire to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and marry her. Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour and Catherine Howard. (Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Henry would divorce two wives, and behead two   Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard   for adultery and treason. He no doubt would have remained married to his third wife, Jane Seymour, who gave him his son and heir, but she died in childbirth. In the end, only two wives   Anne of Cleves, who he divorced years prior, and his final wife, Katherine Parr   would outlive him.

Catherine of Aragon (1485 1536) Born in Alcal  de Henares, Princess Catherine was betrothed to England s Prince Arthur at the age of three. A devout Catholic, she was married to Henry for nearly 24 years and never acknowledged the annulment of their union Catherine of Aragon, first wife of King Henry VIII. (Photo by Imagno/Getty Images) The question of Henry s marriage became of paramount importance to England in 1502, following the death of his elder brother, Arthur. As the new heir to the throne, it was up to Henry to continue the fledgling Tudor dynasty. He didn t need to look far for a possible bride: Catherine of Aragon was the youngest daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. Engaged as a child to Prince Arthur as part of Henry VII s plans for an alliance between Spain and England, 15-year-old Catherine arrived in England in 1501 and was married on 14 November that year. Half of her promised dowry of 200,000 crowns was paid shortly after. It was the perfect royal match but, just six months later, Arthur was dead. To avoid handing back Catherine s dowry, and to maintain the Spanish alliance, a new betrothal was made between the widow and Prince Henry, five years her junior. In Tudor eyes, Catherine s marriage to Arthur had made her Henry s sister. So papal dispensation was sought, and granted, to permit the union   but only after Catherine had sworn that her short marriage had not been consummated. Five years of wrangling over her dowry ensued, but Catherine s patience was rewarded when, in 1509, she married the new king, 18-year-old Henry. The union seems to have been, initially, one of mutual love as well as dynastic advancement. Henry had known Catherine for nearly a decade on their marriage, and she is described as being every inch the beautiful queen. For the first 10 to 15 years, the marriage appears to have been a happy one For the first 10 to 15 years, the marriage appears to have been a happy one. Henry himself wrote that the love he bore his wife was such that  if he were still free, he would choose her in preference to all others . The pair shared a passion for learning, religion and court entertainment, and Catherine proved herself a competent regent while Henry campaigned in France between 1512 14. But by 1518, relations had soured. Catherine, now 33, had at least six pregnancies in nine years, but only two children had survived. One longed-for boy, Prince Henry, was born in 1511 and a huge tournament was held in his honour, the third most expensive event of Henry s reign. Young Prince Hal was the toast of the kingdom but, just 52 days after his birth, Henry s much-loved heir died. The prince s death devastated the couple but hope was restored with the birth of Princess Mary in 1516. Her birth proved Catherine could bear a living child, but could she provide a son? Henry, it seemed, had his doubts. By 1525, with his wife no longer able to bear children and with only one legitimate child   a daughter at that   Henry began to question his marriage. Had Catherine and Arthur s union been consummated; was God punishing him for marrying his brother s widow? Your ultimate guide to the Tudors What is the rhyme about Henry VIII s six wives? Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived The ditty refers to the fate of each wife: Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII divorced after the king broke from Rome to marry his second wife; Anne Boleyn died by execution after she was accused of having sexual relations with five men, including her brother, outside of her marriage; Jane Seymour died during childbirth; Catherine Howard was beheaded; and Katherine Parr outlived Henry VIII and consequently  survived  their relationship. 8 places associated with Henry VIII s wives that you can visit The famous rhyme has been memorised by generations of school children learning about Henry VIII. Although only six words long, it is not entirely accurate   Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves did not technically divorce Henry VIII; instead their marriages were annulled. Another version of the poem is:  King Henry VIII, to six wives he was wedded. One died, one survived, two divorced, two beheaded . Anne Boleyn (c1501 1536) The daughter of a courtier and diplomat, Anne s relationship with Henry brought about the English Reformation. She was the first English queen to be publicly executed Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII and mother of future queen, Elizabeth I. (Photo by Time Life Pictures/Mansell/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images) Henry had another reason for wishing to end his marriage to Catherine of Aragon: he had fallen in love. The object of his affections was the quick-witted Anne Boleyn, who had returned to England in 1522, after nearly seven years living at the French court. By Tudor tastes, which held fair women in high esteem, the brunette, dark-eyed Anne was no belle, but her charm, style and sophistication set her apart from the other ladies at court and ultimately captured Henry s heart. Anne had been at court for four years before there was any hint of romance between the pair, but by 1526 Cupid s arrow had struck and Henry had begun courting Anne in earnest. In his early relationship with Anne, Henry revealed a genuinely romantic side   one that few would equate with the cantankerous, suspicious and cruel tyrant of his later years. The 17 surviving love letters from Henry to Anne are the stuff of true Tudor romance. In them, it s clear to see that Henry s desire for Anne is growing, as is his frustration at her constant refusal to become his mistress, and his desperation for the dissolution of his marriage. At some point in 1532, Anne submitted to the king s advances and, by December that year, she was pregnant. Henry was beside himself with joy. Achieving his annulment from Catherine   who clung grimly and steadfastly to her marriage and crown   now consumed his thoughts. Watch: Tracy Borman on what Elizabeth I thought of her mother   in less than 60 seconds It was imperative the new baby be born legitimate so, on 25 January 1533, Henry married Anne Boleyn in secret. With the Pope still refusing to end the marriage, the monumental decision was taken to reject papal authority altogether. On 23 May, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer confirmed the annulment and Anne was crowned on 1 June in a magnificent coronation. Her seven-year wait for crown, and king, was over. Having overturned the religious and political life of England to marry Anne and conceive an heir, Henry was convinced his unborn child would be a son. The birth of Elizabeth, on 7 September 1533, therefore, was a bitter blow and must have caused considerable anxiety to Anne, who had seen her predecessor cast aside for the same. Sunshine and storms The fiery nature of Henry and Anne s relationship is well-documented but they are also described as being  merry  together. Theirs, as one historian puts it, was  a tumultuous relationship of sunshine and storms . Anne suffered at least two miscarriages during the marriage, the second of which, in January 1536, was a boy. But, despite Anne s failure to produce an heir, it is widely believed that Henry remained committed to his wife. Court gossip and intrigue, however, was to change his mind. Anne s downfall seems to have been result of malicious gossip and plots to end her influence over the King. Rumours of her infidelity emerged after a lady-in-waiting was heard to describe her own loose living as being  little in comparison with that of the Queen . Henry, who prized chastity in his wives above all else, ordered his chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, to investigate, telling him  if it turns out that your report, which I do not wish to believe, is untrue, you will receive pain of death in place of [the accused].  Little wonder, then, that by May 1536, Cromwell had unearthed  evidence  of adultery, incest and conspiring the king s death. Anne s beheading, at the hands of a French executioner, was to be a turning point in Henry s life and reign. Henry s break with Rome: king v pope Henry s break with Rome heralded the creation of a new Church, and the king s own excommunication  England s split from papal power was triggered by Henry s desire to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, a union for which he felt God was punishing him with a lack of male heir. The king s desire to marry Anne Boleyn only increased his determination: it became known as  The King s Great Matter . In 1527, Pope Clement VII was approached for an annulment on scriptural grounds but, to Henry s anger and frustration, it was refused. A legal approach seemed the only solution and it fell to Wolsey s successor, Thomas Cromwell, to use the powers of Parliament to decide the matter in the King s favour. A series of acts were passed, cutting back papal power and influence in England. In 1533, Thomas Cranmer was appointed to the post of Archbishop of Canterbury and, on 23 May that year   hastened by the news that Anne was pregnant   he pronounced Henry and Catherine s marriage to be against the law of God. Five days later, Cranmer validated Anne and Henry s marriage, which had taken place some months earlier. The pope was infuriated by the news, and excommunicated Henry. In England, Parliament was swiftly called, and the legislation to enact Henry s decision to break with the Church in Rome was passed. The Act of Supremacy, which followed in November 1534, recognised Henry as supreme head of the Church of England, and rejected all  foreign authority . This effectively brought an end to centuries of papal jurisdiction over religious life in England. The act also stated that Henry and his heirs would have  full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, reform, order, correct, restrain and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, o ences... whatsoever they be.  Cromwell now had the tools with which to reform the English Church. In January 1536, he embarked upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries, bringing their immense wealth and landholdings under crown control. Jane Seymour (c1508 1537) Lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon and then Anne Boleyn, Jane was the only one of Henry s wives to receive a queen s funeral, despite the fact she was never crowned Jane Seymour, third wife of Henry VIII. (Photo by Getty Images) As Anne met her grisly end, Henry, now 45 and without a male heir, had already found his third wife   Jane Seymour, Anne s lady-in-waiting. Demure, calm and gentle, 27-year-old Jane was Anne s opposite in both looks and temperament, and within 24 hours of Anne s death, Henry and Jane were betrothed. Jane s hold over Henry has been much discussed by historians. Although lacking Anne s education and sophistication, Jane is said to have possessed a quiet determination and was able to manage Henry and his everincreasing outbursts of temper. When Henry learned of her pregnancy in early 1537, he took great pains to ensure her every whim was catered for, even shipping quails eggs from France to satisfy her cravings. Nothing was denied the woman he described as his  one true wife  and his attentions were rewarded with the birth of Edward in October 1537. But 12 days later, Henry was mourning the death of his third wife, after postnatal complications. Anne of Cleves (1515 1557) Born in D sseldorf, Anne was culturally unsophisticated by Tudor standards. She was referred to as  The King s Beloved Sister  after the annulment of her marriage to Henry Anne of Cleves, fourth wife of Henry VIII. (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images); Paris, Mus e Du Louvre. (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images) Henry remained single for two years after Jane s death, but England had become vulnerable without the support of Rome. A political alliance was deemed necessary and the net was cast for a new wife. Henry s first glimpse of his future bride, Anne of Cleves, was a portrait by court painter Hans Holbein, in which she is depicted as a handsome, demure-looking woman. But, for Henry at least, the gap between portrait and reality was vast, and after meeting Anne he allegedly railed at his advisors:  I like her not! I like her not!  The meeting was a disaster. Henry, in chivalric tradition, chose to meet his bride-to-be in disguise. Anne s role was to see through this to recognise her King and true love Sadly no one explained this to Anne who, when Henry attempted to kiss her, is said to have recoiled at the over familiarity displayed by what she perceived to be a lowly servant. Henry, faced with the reality that he was no longer the golden Prince of his youth, was utterly humiliated. The marriage lasted just six months   Henry was allegedly unable to consummate the union and his eyes were already set on a new prize. Catherine Howard (c1524 1542) Cousin to Anne Boleyn, Catherine was raised in the household of her father s stepmother at Lambeth Palace. Her former indiscretions and an affair with a courtier cost her her life Catherine Howard, fifth wife of Henry VIII. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) Now nearly 50, Henry had fallen in love again, with another lady-in-waiting: 19-year-old Catherine Howard. To the ageing and ailing king, Catherine was everything a queen should be: obedient, fertile and chaste. Henry was entranced; Catherine made him feel young again, helping him forget the constant pain of his ulcerated legs.  The King is so amorous of her that he cannot treat her well enough, and caresses her more than he did the others , wrote the French ambassador of the love-struck king. How Catherine felt about being married to a man old enough to be her grandfather is unknown, but she is said to have accepted her lot with good grace, anxious to please her ambitious family. Catherine loved the luxury of court and her besotted husband showered her with expensive gifts. But, just 14 months into the marriage, a distraught Henry was presented with evidence of Catherine s infidelity: on 13 February 1542, his  rose without a thorn  was beheaded. Katherine Parr (1512 1548) Already twice-widowed, Katherine had begun a romance with Thomas Seymour, brother to the late queen, when she caught Henry s eye. She went on to marry Seymour four months after the king s death Katherine Parr, the last wife of Henry VIII. (Photo by Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images) Catherine s death saw Henry slump into a deep depression, and with no new wife waiting in the wings to distract him, his erratic temper made court a dangerous place to be. The lonely monarch needed a companion and, in 1543, as plague broke out in London, Henry married twice-widowed Katherine Parr at Hampton Court Palace. Aged 31, Katherine was slim and attractive   far from the matronly figure she is often portrayed as   with a deep love of learning and desire for religious reform. She quickly established herself as a major influence in Henry s life, developing relationships with the royal children and tending to the king. Her position seemed unshakeable, but in 1546, Katherine nearly became a third victim of the executioner s blade when her passion for the  new faith  (Protestantism) triggered accusations of heresy. Tipped off in advance, Katherine took to her bed claiming she was mortally ill; when Henry rushed to her side, she successfully defended herself and her actions. Katherine outlived Henry   as did Anne of Cleves   but she wasn t at the king s side when he died in 1547. When this larger-than-life ruler passed away, he was safe in the knowledge he had secured the continuation of the Tudor dynasty. But as Henry was buried beside his beloved Jane Seymour at Windsor Castle, no one could have known that it would be his daughters   Mary and Elizabeth   who would change the course of British history. Henry VIII's royal mistresses It wasn t only the lawfully wedded wives who shared the king's royal bed... Henry s favourite mistress was Elizabeth  Bessie  Blount, lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon. The affair began in c1514 and it is even claimed that Henry considered divorcing Catherine in order to marry her. Bessie gave birth to a son in 1519, a boy the king named Henry Fitzroy. Fitzroy was made Earl of Nottingham and Duke of Richmond and Somerset at the age of six, and Henry was even rumoured to be considering marrying Fitzroy to his legitimate daughter, Mary, as a way of legitimising the boy s claim to the throne. Whether Henry would have ever made Fitzroy his heir is unknown, for he died of tuberculosis in 1536, aged 17. Another of Henry s known mistresses was Mary Boleyn, sister to Anne. Mary, too, served at the French court, where she embarked on a string of a airs, including one with King Francis I himself. Mary s promiscuity earned her the nickname  The English Mare  and, later,  The Great Prostitute . Her five-year affair with Henry, which began in c1521, may have produced two children. There is even a claim that Henry had an affair with Anne and Mary s mother, Elizabeth, although when asked whether he had  meddled both with the mother and the sister , he is said to have muttered  never with the mother !

        "title": "The discovery of Richard III's remains",
        "content": "How did you feel when you began to suspect that you had found the site where Richard was buried? Philippa Langley: The research, which was key, was looking really good. There was a lot of information to back us up, but the belief still wasn t there in terms of the academic community. It really was an uphill struggle, but I think we just had to say,  Let s just cut the tarmac and see.  Ad Michael Jones: Philippa and I first met in 2002, and I think it was in 2003 that we started having conversations about bringing the real Richard centre stage. When we finally found him, I remember a feeling of awe and excitement as the events unfolded. It was incredible. What did you think when you found that the skeleton was, in fact, curved? PL: That was a big moment for me, because I d spent so long researching Richard III. He was very physically able, so to be told   and it s such an inappropriate word, but we don t have another   that he was hunchbacked didn t fit with everything I knew about the man. But the specialists were telling me that he was, and when you looked into the grave you could see that he was hunched. The evidence was staring me right in the face. It absolutely threw me, though. I just felt that, if Richard was proved to be the hunchbacked king that Shakespeare had portrayed, it would set us back completely despite all the work that we had tried to do in looking at the real man. So many historians are tied to the Tudor propaganda, and I thought we d never get to the real man. MJ: I found it very moving. Richard s condition was used as a judgment by the Tudors and in Shakespeare. It was seen as a deformity, one that physically mirrored a deformity of the mind. I felt a profound sense of sympathy: I didn t see the deformed or evil individual, I saw a person under an oppressive weight, and this got me thinking about moments in his life and career. Philippa, do you find that your role in the Richard III Society makes it harder to persuade people that you re coming from a neutral viewpoint? PL: No, I don t think so. Would I say that I m neutral? I wouldn t say that I am, actually, because I do believe that Richard has been maligned, and I do believe that his reputation has been pretty much dragged through the mire for 500 years. But the Richard III Society has a mission statement that says that the traditional accounts of Richard are neither supported by the facts nor reasonably tenable, and I have to say that I concur with that mission statement 100 per cent. I would say that my position is that I need to have an open mind; as a screenwriter, I couldn t go into the research thinking that he was a saint, because I m looking for the human being. We re all complex, we re all conflicted. That s how we are, that s the human condition. So what I m looking for in Richard is what made his  human condition . What do you think is the truth behind the princes in the Tower story? MJ: I think it would be useful to say, first of all, where we agree! We both believe that Richard had a viable claim to the throne, despite it later being vigorously suppressed by the Tudors. We agree that Richard believed in this claim, and that quite a substantial number of other people did too. And that s important because it means that it was not necessary for him to kill the princes, the sons of Edward IV, to take the throne. So that is our common ground, and that puts us in a different camp from a lot of historians and a lot of people, but we feel that is good. What we disagree on is the fact that I feel that cruel necessity, and an attempt to rescue or remove the princes from the Tower early on in Richard s reign, may have forced the king s hand. In other words, the survival of Richard s dynasty was at stake. Philippa disagrees: she feels that he wouldn t have done that. Our belief is that a debate is very healthy, very honest, because we don t know what happened, and we believe that debating it will help push research onwards. That s what really needs to happen: we need to keep discussing this and hopefully more evidence may come to light one way or another. Where do you think that Richard s remains should be buried? PL: I think we re both of the opinion that we just have to let the due process of law take place. We definitely agree that Richard needs to be buried with decency, and dignity, and with honour, because in 1485 we now know that he wasn t given any of that. And I think that it s important that we make a powerful statement, and by reburying him in this way, we re saying that we recognise what went on in the past, but we re not repeating it. What surprised you most in the course of this whole project? PL: I think, for me, one of the things about the project that really hit home was some of the mythology that we ve been able to blow. For instance, we now know that his body wasn t thrown into the river Soar, and that he didn t have a withered arm. We know that his head didn t crack Bow Bridge when he was slung over a horse coming back into Leicester. We know that he didn t have kyphosis [a disability causing the head to be pushed on to the chest]. Those are just some of the myths that have been shattered already by this project, and I think that what I d like is that the project reveals this mythology, the stories that grew up around Richard, that subsequently became his history. MJ: There was something extraordinarily powerful in getting a sense of what his face might have been like   particularly with so much distortion around his story. For me, the book represents two journeys: the search for the remains, and the search for the real Richard. In a sense, the remains were buried and so was the real Richard, under a mound of Tudor propaganda. But there s another burial, which is of this endless debate over whether he was  bad  or  good . I believe that the book shows that he was a complicated, extraordinary, charismatic man, who could also be politically ruthless. Our hope is that instead of seeing him either as dark or white, people will get a view of a real man living in a very violent and turbulent period of history. Philippa Langley and Michael Jones are the authors of The King s Grave (John Murray). The book chronicles the lead-up to the discovery of Richard III beneath a Leicester car park in 2012 Ad This article was first published in the November 2013 issue of BBC History Magazine",

        "title": "The princes in the Tower: why was their fate never explained?",
        "content": "This article was first published in the October 2013 issue of BBC History Magazine Ad Locked in the Tower in June 1483 with his younger brother, the 12-year-old Edward V was certain  that death was facing him . Two overthrown kings had died in suspicious circumstances already that century. Yet it was still possible their uncle, Richard III, would spare them. The princes were so very young, and if it were accepted that they were bastards, as their uncle claimed, they would pose little threat. The innocent Richard, Duke of York, only nine years old, remained  joyous  and full of  frolics , even as the last of their servants were dismissed. But the boys were spotted behind the Tower windows less and less often, and by the summer s end they had vanished. It is the fact of their disappearance that lies at the heart of the many conspiracy theories over what happened to the princes. Murder was suspected, but without bodies no one could be certain even that they were dead. Many different scenarios have been put forward in the years since. In the nearest surviving contemporary accounts, Richard is accused of ordering their deaths, with the boys either suffocated with their bedding, or drowned, or killed by having their arteries cut. There were also theories that one or both of the princes escaped. In more modern times, some have come to believe that Richard III was innocent of ordering the children s deaths and instead spirited his nephews abroad or to a safe place nearer home, only for them to be killed later by Henry VII who feared the boys  rival claims to the throne. None of these theories, however, has provided a satisfactory answer to the riddle at the heart of this mystery: the fact the boys simply vanished. If the princes were alive, why did Richard not say so in October 1483, when the rumours he had ordered them killed were fuelling a rebellion? If they were dead, why had he not followed earlier examples of royal killings? The bodies of deposed kings were displayed and claims made that they had died of natural causes, so that loyalties could be transferred to the new king. That the answer to these questions lies in the 15th century seems obvious, but it can be hard to stop thinking like 21st-century detectives and start thinking like contemporaries. To the modern mind, if Richard III was a religious man and a good king, as many believe he was, then he could not have ordered the deaths of two children. But even good people do bad things if they re given the right motivation. In the 15th century it was a primary duty of good kingship to ensure peace and national harmony. After his coronation, Richard III continued to employ many of his brother Edward IV s former servants, but by the end of July 1483 it was already clear that some did not accept that Edward IV s sons were illegitimate and judged Richard to be a usurper. The fact the princes remained a focus of opposition gave Richard a strong motive for having them killed   just as his brother had killed the king he deposed. The childlike, helpless, Lancastrian Henry VI was found dead in the Tower in 1471, after more than a decade of conflict between the rival royal Houses of Lancaster and York. It was said he was killed by grief and rage over the death in battle of his son, but few can have doubted that Edward IV ordered Henry s murder. Henry VI s death extirpated the House of Lancaster. Only Henry VI s half nephew, Henry Tudor, a descendent of John of Gaunt, founder of the Lancastrian House, through his mother s illegitimate Beaufort line, was left to represent their cause. Trapped in European exile, Henry Tudor posed a negligible threat to Edward IV. However, Richard was acutely aware of an unexpected sequel to Henry VI s death. The murdered king was acclaimed as a saint, with rich and poor alike venerating him as an innocent whose troubled life gave him some insight into their own difficulties. Miracles were reported at the site of his modest grave in Chertsey Abbey, Surrey. One man claimed that the dead king had even deigned to help him when he had a bean trapped in his ear, with said bean popping out after he prayed to the deposed king. Edward IV failed to put a halt to the popular cult and Richard III shared his late brother s anxieties about its ever-growing power. It had a strong following in his home city of York, where a statue of  Henry the saint  was built on the choir screen at York Minster. In 1484 Richard attempted to take control of the cult with an act of reconciliation, moving Henry VI s body to St George s Chapel, Windsor. In the meantime, there was a high risk the dead princes too would attract a cult, for in them the religious qualities attached to royalty were combined with the purity of childhood. An insecure king In England we have no equivalent today to the shrine at Lourdes in France, visited by thousands of pilgrims every year looking for healing or spiritual renewal. But we can recall the vast crowds outside Buckingham Palace after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Imagine that feeling and enthusiasm in pilgrims visiting the tombs of two young princes and greatly magnified by the closeness people then felt with the dead. It would have been highly dangerous to the king who had taken their throne. The vanishing of the princes was for Richard a case of least said, soonest mended, for without a grave for them, there could be no focus for a cult. Without a body or items belonging to the dead placed on display, there would be no relics either. Nevertheless, Richard needed the princes  mother, Elizabeth Woodville, and others who might follow Edward V, to know the boys were dead, in order to forestall plots raised in their name. According to the Tudor historian Polydore Vergil, Elizabeth Woodville fainted when she was told her sons had been killed. As she came round,  She wept, she cryed out loud, and with lamentable shrieks made all the house ring, she struck her breast, tore and cut her hair.  She also called for vengeance. Elizabeth Woodville made an agreement with Henry Tudor s mother, Margaret Beaufort, that Henry should marry her daughter, Elizabeth of York, and called on Edwardian loyalists to back their cause. The rebellion that followed in October 1483 proved Richard had failed to restore peace. While he defeated these risings, less than two years later at the battle of Bosworth, in August 1485, he was betrayed by part of his own army and was killed, sword in hand. The princes were revenged, but it soon became evident that Henry VII was in no hurry to investigate their fate. It is possible that the new monarch feared such an investigation would draw attention to a role in their fate played by someone close to his cause   most likely Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham. The duke, who came from a Lancastrian family, was a close ally of Richard in the overthrow of Edward V, but later turned against the king. Known as a  sore and hard dealing man , it is possible he encouraged Richard to have the princes murdered, planning then to see Richard killed and the House of York overthrown. Richard executed Buckingham for treason in November 1483, but Buckingham s name remained associated at home and abroad with the princes  disappearance. What is certain, however, is that Henry, like Richard, had good reasons for wishing to forestall a cult of the princes. Henry s blood claim to the throne was extremely weak and he was fearful of being seen as a mere king consort to Elizabeth of York. To counter this, Henry claimed the throne in his own right, citing divine providence   God s intervention on earth   as evidence that he was a true king (for only God made kings). A key piece of vidence used in support of this idea was a story that, a few months before his murder,  the saint  Henry VI had prophesised Henry Tudor s reign. It would not have been wise to allow Yorkist royal saints to compete with the memory of Henry VI, whose cult Henry VII now wished to encourage. In 1485, therefore, nothing was said of the princes  disappearance, beyond a vague accusation in parliament during the autumn that Richard III was guilty of  treasons, homicides and murders in shedding of infants  blood . No search was made for the boys  bodies and they were given no rite of burial. Indeed even the fate of their souls was, seemingly, abandoned. I have not found any evidence of endowments set up to pay for prayers for the princes that century. Henry may well have feared the churches where these so-called  chantries  might be established would become centres for the kind of cult he wanted to avoid. But their absence would have struck people as very strange. Praying for the dead was a crucial part of medieval religion. In December 1485 when Henry issued a special charter refounding his favourite religious order, the Observant Friars, at Greenwich, he noted that offering masses for the dead was,  the greatest work of piety and mercy, for through it souls would be purged . It was unthinkable not to help the souls of your loved ones pass from purgatory to heaven with prayers and masses. On the other hand, it was akin to a curse to say a requiem for a living person   you were effectively praying for their death. A surviving prince? The obvious question posed by the lack of public prayers for the princes was, were they still alive? And, as Vergil recalled, in 1491 there appeared in Ireland, as if  raised from the dead one of the sons of King Edward  a youth by the name of Richard . Henry VII said the man claiming to be the younger of the princes was, in fact, a Dutchman called Perkin Warbeck   but who could be sure? Henry was more anxious than ever that the princes be forgotten and when their mother, Elizabeth Woodville, died in June 1492, she was buried  privily  without any solemn dirge done for her obit . It has been suggested this may have reflected her dying wishes to be buried  without pomp . But Henry VII also asked to be buried without pomp. He still expected, and got, one of the most stately funerals of the Middle Ages. Elizabeth Woodville emphatically did not receive the same treatment. Much has been made of this in conspiracy theories concerning the princes (especially on the question of whether she believed them to be alive) but Henry s motives become clear when recalled in the context of the period. This was an era of visual symbols and display: kings projected their power and significance in palaces decorated with their badges, in rich clothes and elaborate ceremonies. Elizabeth Woodville, like her sons, was being denied the images of a great funeral with its effigies, banners and grand ceremonial. This caused negative comment at the time. But with Warbeck s appearance, Henry wanted to avoid any nostalgia for the past glories of the House of York. It was 1497 before Perkin Warbeck was captured. Henry then kept him alive because he wanted Warbeck publicly and repeatedly to confess his modest birth. Warbeck was eventually executed in 1499. Yet even then Henry continued to fear the power of the vanished princes. Three years later, it was given out that condemned traitor Sir James Tyrell had, before his execution, confessed to arranging their murder on Richard s orders. Henry VIII s chancellor, Thomas More, claimed he was told the murdered boys had been buried at the foot of some stairs in the Tower, but that Richard had asked for their bodies to be reburied with dignity and that those involved had subsequently died so the boys  final resting place was unknown   a most convenient outcome for Henry. While the princes  graves remained unmarked, the tomb of Henry VI came to rival the internationally famous tomb of Thomas Becket at Canterbury as a site of mass pilgrimage. Henry ran a campaign to have his half-uncle beatified by the pope, which continued even after Henry s death, ending only with Henry VIII s break with Rome. The Reformation then brought to a close the cult of saints in England. Our cultural memories of their power faded away, which explains why we overlook the significance of the cult of Henry VI in the fate of the princes. In 1674, long after the passing of the Tudors, two skeletons were recovered in the Tower, in a place that resembled More s description of the princes  first burial place. They were interred at Westminster Abbey, not far from where Henry VII lies. In 1933, they were removed and examined by two doctors. Broken and incomplete, the skeletons were judged to be two children, one aged between seven and 11 and the other between 11 and 13. The little bones were returned to the abbey, and whoever they were, remain a testament to the failure of Richard and Henry to bury the princes in eternal obscurity. The players in the princes  downfall Henry VI (1421 71) Succeeding his father, Henry V, who died when he was a few months old, Henry VI s reign was challenged by political and economic crises. It was interrupted by his mental and physical breakdown in 1453 during which time Richard, 3rd Duke of York, was appointed protector of the realm. Both men were direct descendants of Edward III and in 1455 Richard s own claim to the throne resulted in the first clashes of the Wars of the Roses   fought between supporters of the dynastic houses of Lancaster and York over the succession. Richard died at the battle of Wakefield in 1460 but his family claim to the throne survived him and his eldest son became king the following year   as Edward IV. Richard s younger son would also be king, as Richard III. Henry VI was briefly restored to the throne in 1470 but the Lancastrians were finally defeated at Tewkesbury in 1471 and Henry was probably put to death in the Tower of London a few days later. Edward IV (1442 83) Edward succeeded where his father Richard, the third Duke of York failed   in overthrowing Henry VI during the Wars of the Roses. He was declared king in March 1461, securing his throne with a victory at the battle of Towton. Edward s younger brother Richard became Duke of Gloucester. Later, in Edward s second reign, Richard played an important role in government. Edward married Elizabeth Woodville in 1463 and they had 10 children: seven daughters and three sons. The eldest, Elizabeth, was born in 1466. Two of the three sons were alive at the time of Edward s death   Edward, born in 1470, and Richard, born 1473. Edward is credited with being financially astute and restoring law and order. He died unexpectedly of natural causes on 9 April 1483. Elizabeth, Queen Consort (c1437 92) Edward IV s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, a widow with children, took place in secret in 1464 and met with political disapproval. The king s brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was among those allegedly hostile to it. The preference the Woodville family received caused resentment at court, and there was friction between Elizabeth s family and the king s powerful advisor, Hastings. On Edward IV s death in 1483, Gloucester s distrust of the Woodvilles was apparently a factor in his decision to seize control of the heir, his nephew. Elizabeth sought sanctuary in Westminster, from where her younger son, Richard, Duke of York, was later removed. The legitimacy of her marriage and her children was one of Gloucester s justifications for usurping the throne on 26 June. Once parliament confirmed his title as Richard III, Elizabeth submitted in exchange for protection for herself and her daughters   an arrangement he honoured. After Richard III s death at the battle of Bosworth, her children were declared legitimate. Her eldest, Elizabeth of York, was married to Henry VII, strengthening his claim to the throne. Edward V (1470 83) & Richard, Duke of York (1473 83) Edward IV s heir was his eldest son, also named Edward. When the king died unexpectedly, his will, which has not survived, reportedly named his previously loyal brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as lord protector. On hearing of his father s death, the young Edward and his entourage began a journey from Ludlow to the capital. Gloucester intercepted the party in Buckinghamshire. Gloucester, who claimed the Woodvilles were planning to take power by force, seized the prince. On 4 May 1983, Edward entered London in the charge of Gloucester. Edward s coronation was scheduled for 22 June. On 16 June, Elizabeth was persuaded to surrender Edward s younger brother, Richard, apparently to attend the ceremony. With both princes in his hands, Gloucester publicised his claim to the throne. He was crowned as Richard III on 6 July and a conspiracy to rescue the princes failed that month. By September, rebels were seeing Henry Tudor as a candidate for the throne, suggesting the princes were already believed to be dead. Richard III (1452 85) Richard was the youngest surviving son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and was still a child when his 18-year-old brother became Edward IV after Yorkist victories. Unlike his brother George (executed for treason in the Tower in 1478   allegedly drowned in a butt of malmsey wine), Richard was loyal to Edward during his lifetime. On his brother s death, he moved swiftly to wrest control of his nephew Edward from the boy s maternal family, the Woodvilles. At some point in June 1483 his role moved from that of protector to usurper. He arrested several of the previous king s loyal advisors, postponed the coronation and claimed Edward IV s children were illegitimate because their father had been pre-contracted to marry another woman at the time of his secret marriage to Elizabeth. Richard was crowned, but he faced rebellion that year and further unrest the next. Support for the king decreased as it grew for Henry Tudor, the rival claimant who returned from exile and triumphed at the battle of Bosworth in 1485. Henry VII (1457 1509) Henry Tudor was the son of Margaret Beaufort (great-great-granddaughter of Edward III) and Edmund Tudor, half-brother of Henry VI. In 1471, after Edward IV regained the throne, Henry fled to Brittany, where he avoided the king s attempts to have him returned. As a potential candidate for the throne through his mother s side, Henry became the focus for opposition to Richard III. After the failed 1483 rebellion against the king, rebels, including relatives of the Woodvilles and loyal former members of Edward IV s household, joined him in Brittany. In 1485 Henry Tudor invaded, landing first in Wales, and triumphed over Richard III at Bosworth on 22 August. Ad Henry was crowned on the battlefield with Richard s crown. The following year he further legitimised his right to rule by marrying Elizabeth of York. When the king died in 1509, his and Elizabeth s son came to the throne as Henry VIII.

        "title": "Richard III tomb design unveiled by Leicester Cathedral",
        "content": "The  1.3m plans, which will be submitted to planning officials, would see the former king s remains reinterred in a tomb on a floor inlaid with a large white rose. Ad The top of the tomb would be inclined towards the east, as a symbol of the resurrection of the dead. Carved into the dark circular band on the floor around the tomb would be the name of the king, the dates of his birth and death (1452 85), his personal motto,  Loyaulte me Lie  (Loyalty binds Me), and his badge, which depicts a boar. The tomb would be positioned in a special area created by re-ordering part of the interior of Leicester Cathedral. The area would be defined by wooden screens between the new altar under the tower and a new chapel, which will be used for private prayer and for regular daily worship. The tomb would be situated in what is now the chancel of the cathedral, a traditional place of honour. This is equivalent to the position of the king's original grave in the Grey Friars Priory. The plans, which would also see changes to lighting and the fitting of new stained glass windows, will be submitted to the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England (CFCE). The CFCE is a national body that determines applications for approval of works. A decision is expected by the end of October. Work on the tomb has been complicated by a legal challenge from descendants of the king s relatives, who want to see Richard s remains buried in York. The 15-strong Plantagenet Alliance says Richard regarded York as his home. Last month a High Court judge gave permission for the alliance to challenge plans to rebury the king s remains in Leicester. A judicial review is likely to take place later this year in London, and is expected to last a full day. The justice secretary, Chris Grayling, will defend the decision to bury Richard s remains in Leicester, his department this week confirmed. Announcing the plans for the tomb yesterday afternoon, the dean of Leicester, the Very Reverend David Monteith, said: \"We fully respect the process of the judicial review which will ensure the procedure leading to the reinterment is correct.  While this takes its course we must, as would any cathedral in this position, seek planning permission for the detailed and costly changes which need to be made to the building.  The overall concept is regal and respectful in its elegant simplicity, as befits the final resting place of a king of England. By placing the tomb in our chancel, we are giving King Richard the same honour as did those friars more than 500 years ago.\" Dr Phil Stone, chair of the Richard III Society, said: \"Because of the judicial review, the Society must stick by its neutrality.  If in two to three months  time it is clear that Richard is coming to Leicester then I hope this will proceed according to these plans.  This design is utterly inspired and if it does not come here, I hope they will do the same thing somewhere else.\" Richard's skeleton was discovered underneath a Leicester council car park last September, 527 years after he was killed at the battle of Bosworth. The remains were in February identified as those of the last Plantagenet king and, as an organisation closely involved in the discovery, the University of Leicester holds a Ministry of Justice licence that allows it to decide where the remains are reinterred. The university decided on Leicester Cathedral. Ad What do you think of the plans for the tomb? Share your views by commenting below, or posting a message on Twitter or Facebook.",

        "content": "By September 96, the emperor Domitian had ruled Rome for 15 years, longer than anyone since Tiberius. He had established a reputation as a supremely competent administrator, who concentrated power in his own hands and maintained his popularity through building works, bread and circuses. Ad Among one group, however, Emperor Domitian s name was mud. For the traditional aristocracy, his contempt for the Senate was simply too much to bear. And, as the 15th anniversary of his accession approached, a group of disaffected patricians decided that it was time to act. Read more: The 8 bloodiest Roman emperors in history At midday on 18 September, the emperor seemed in a restless mood. According to the historian Suetonius, an astrologer had warned him that he would die around midday, so he was never at his best during lunchtime. At one point, Domitian distractedly asked a servant boy what time it was. Well after noon, the boy said. Relieved, the emperor sat down to work, poring over his state papers. At that moment, he was approached by a servant, one Stephanus. For some days, Stephanus had been wearing bandages, supposedly after an accident. In fact, the bandages were concealing a dagger, which he now produced behind his back. He handed the emperor another document, and as Domitian began to read, Stephanus stabbed him violently in the groin. More servants clustered around; more blows fell. In the confusion, Stephanus himself was mortally wounded. But by now, Domitian s robes were scarlet with blood. A few moments later, the last of the Flavian emperors was dead.

        "title": "Tudor dining: a guide to food and status in the 16th century",
        "content": "In Tudor England, maintaining the difference between ranks was so important to the concept of a well-ordered society that efforts were made to enshrine the distinctions between the classes in  sumptuary  laws. These laws tried to control what you ate and wore, according to your position in the God-given hierarchy, which stretched from the king at the top, down through the numerous grades of nobility and clergy, to the gentry, yeomen and finally the labourers at the bottom of the heap. Ad Of course, for the poorest, sumptuary laws were not terribly relevant. Labourers would not often be able to afford more than pottage   the staple dish   and you could eat as much of that as your budget would allow. The rich ate pottage too, but instead of what was basically cabbage soup with some barley or oats   and a sniff of bacon if you were lucky   a nobleman s pottage might contain almonds, ginger and saffron, as well as wine. However, for aspiring courtiers who spent fortunes trying to outdo one other in lavish display, the sumptuary law was very relevant indeed. Failure to obey it could earn you a fine, as well as contempt for trying to  ape your betters . In theory, even the nobles were supposed to limit the amount spent on food each year to about 10 per cent of their capital, although that was for their immediate family, and did not include the amount to be spent on the household. The other rule to take into account was the strict observance of fasting on Fridays, Saturdays and, sometimes, Wednesdays too. Fasting did not mean going without food altogether, just eschewing flesh, and, in Lent, butter, eggs and dairy foods as well. Children, pregnant women and the elderly were not expected to fast, however, and it was possible to obtain a dispensation from fasting, but this was exceptional. Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, was hauled before the King s Council and severely reprimanded in 1543 for flagrantly eating meat during Lent. He was either deliberately risking an accusation of heresy (the reformed church being inclined to see fasting as superstitious), or he actively disliked fish. Pocket permitting, meat was replaced by an extraordinary array of fish and other seafoods, including seal and porpoise, the latter apparently a great favourite of Katharine of Aragon. Monarchs, although strictly observing the rules of fasting, were, of course, unlimited in what they could eat, or provide for their guests and courtiers. On flesh days at Henry VIII s court, a staggering range of meats and fowl would be enjoyed, including brawn, beef, mutton, bacon, goose, veal and lamb. Kid, hens, capons and peacocks also featured, as did cygnet, mallard, teal, woodcock, ousels, thrush, robins, cranes, bitterns, buzzards and venison of all sorts. Venison was the king of meats   not available to buy, it was hunted in the deer parks of the king and his nobles, and frequently given as a present. Henry VIII sent a hart to Anne Boleyn as a symbol of courtship. Four seasons Seasonality was a major factor in 16th-century diets. For small-scale farmers, there was insufficient feed to keep livestock over winter, so the majority were slaughtered   traditionally on Martinmas (11 November), and as much of the meat as possible was preserved. But no matter how thrifty the housewife, eking out the meat of a single pig through the whole winter with a few onions and leeks must have been a hard task. The wealthier landowners could keep more meat, slaughtering as needed. Game continued to be hunted throughout the winter by the wealthy, but poaching by the poor could mean hanging. Estimates suggest the Tudor nobility s diet was 80 per cent protein   one wonders how the digestive tract coped! Salads were eaten, often comprising a mixture of cooked and raw ingredients and including green vegetables such as leeks, onions, radishes and cabbage, as well as lettuce, chives, boiled carrots, flowers and herbs. They were dressed with oil, vinegar, and sometimes sugar. Turnips, consumed during the 15th and early 16th century, later fell out of favour, becoming considered fit only for cattle. Fruit was enjoyed, but with no refrigeration it could only be consumed in season, or preserved. Mary I was particularly fond of pears, and Elizabeth of York and Jane Seymour were great lovers of cherries. Henry VIII s new palaces were designed with plentiful orchards and fruit trees, including the new apricot trees, introduced in the 1540s. One of his last acts as king was to order new apple trees for his Privy Gardens. Most households served three meals a day, although breakfast, if eaten at all, was not substantial: it consisted of bread, perhaps with butter and sage, washed down with a small ale. The main meal of the day was dinner. In the first half of the century, 10 or 11am was the dining hour, but by the 1580s and 1590s it was becoming more usual to eat at around 12pm. In the houses of the rich, the meal could easily last a couple of hours. On ordinary days in any home of the middle class or above, dinner was divided into two courses, each consisting of several different dishes. A numbers game The Sumptuary Law of 31 May 1517 dictated the number of dishes per meal: a cardinal could serve nine dishes, while dukes, marquises, bishops and earls could serve seven. Lower-ranking lords were permitted to serve only six, and the gentry class, with an income of  40 100 per annum, could serve three. A dish contained a set amount of a particular item   for example, one swan, bustard or peacock (all reserved for the higher ranks of nobility), but four smaller fowl, or 12 very small birds, such as larks. To prevent the higher ranks feeling deprived if they went out to dinner, the host could serve the number of dishes and food appropriate to the highest-ranking guest. Additionally, weddings were exempt from the rules. Both courses would offer a pottage plus a selection of meats, custards, tarts, fritters and fruit. The first course tended to offer boiled meats, and the second, roasted or baked meats. For formal feasts, each course was heralded by the entrance of the  subtlety . This was an extraordinary decorative art form, the creation of wonderful representations of castles, cathedrals, hunting scenes or similar, made of marzipan and spun sugar for the most important feasts, and of wax for lesser occasions. In 1527, Cardinal Wolsey served a superlative feast for the French embassy, including subtleties of castles, of the church and spire of St Paul s, of  beasts, birds, fowls of diverse kinds, personages  some fighting  some leaping  some dancing , and a whole chess set of sugar paste, which the French delighted in so much it was boxed up and sent home with them. At court, following the two main courses was a third, consisting of spiced wine, known as hippocras; sweetmeats, comfits of all kinds, and wafers. Wafers, forbidden to all but the highest ranks, were thin, crisp biscuits made by pressing flavoured batter between hot irons. This course, eaten standing, was known as the  void , variously taken as meaning that the table had been cleared, or  voided , or that the course was eaten in a smaller room, thus  voiding  the hall. Supper, eaten at around 4 or 5pm outside court circles, was a much simpler affair. Meanwhile at court there were again two courses, each made up of numerous dishes. If this sounds like a huge amount of food, it is worth remembering that the lives of even the elite required far greater calorie intake than is necessary today: houses were extremely cold, with no carpets or curtains, and the only source of heat was a fire. Travel was on foot or horseback for most of the time, both of which require substantial amounts of energy. Hunting, hawking, dancing and archery are also energetic pastimes. Elizabeth I was famous for standing for hours, and walking long distances at a brisk pace with her ladies trailing behind her, complaining bitterly. Social customs In the medieval period, dining, like everything else, was a communal affair. Henry VII and Elizabeth of York frequently dined in public in the Great Hall, surrounded by the court. However, Henry VIII preferred to dine in his Presence Chamber   a half public, half private space   and frequently took supper in his private rooms with a few friends and his current wife. Elizabeth I followed this example, and, unless she was entertaining foreign dignitaries or was on progress, usually dined alone. At dinner in the Great Hall, whether in one of the royal palaces or the castle of a nobleman, the highest-ranking people sat at the top table, raised on a dais, with other tables arranged at right angles. A strict order of hierarchy was adhered to, with the higher-ranking people sitting at the table to the right hand of the top table, on both sides, moving down to the lowest ranking present at the furthest end of the table to the left of the top table. To make sure everyone was seated correctly, books of etiquette gave elaborate orders of precedence, even including instructions for the seating of the pope s foster-parents   woe betide the hostess whose steward got it wrong! Dining furniture consisted of trestles, which were stored when not in use. The highest-ranking person had a chair, but everyone else sat on benches. The table was covered with a cloth, and it was considered very poor manners to spill. The cost of clothes and the difficulty of laundering also added to the need to eat carefully. Food was shared in a  mess : a portion of each dish. At the top table, there was a mess between two (except the king and queen, who each had their own), but the lower ranks shared between four   two on either side of the table. Following her proxy marriage to James IV of Scotland, Margaret, daughter of Henry VII, shared a mess with her mother, Elizabeth of York, to demonstrate her new rank as a fellow queen. The highest-ranking person helped himself first. As eating was communal, it was important to follow the strict rules of etiquette: these were elaborate, yet practical, as they prevented anyone touching food that would be eaten by someone else. Everyone brought his own knife and spoon to the meal   forks being considered a fancy, foreign notion. The requirement for a personal spoon is behind the custom of giving one as a christening gift. The place setting was a trencher   made of silver, or even gold, for the king, then of lesser value material through to the standard ash, or, for the poorest, bread; together with a cup, a loaf of bread of appropriate quality (fine white for the lord, and coarse brown for lesser mortals). Among the upper classes a linen napkin was provided, which was draped over the left shoulder. Salt, being costly, was usually only seen on the top table. For soft foods, the diner would spoon some of the serving onto his trencher, being careful not to leave his spoon in the dish. Before taking a helping of anything else, he would wipe his spoon clean with bread. He would eat the food by dipping his bread into it, rather than spooning it up, so none of his saliva could enter the communal bowl. For meat, he would grasp the piece he wanted with the thumb and two fingers of his left hand, then sever it from the joint, using his knife in his right hand, again ensuring his fingers touched only his own portion. The food was lifted to the mouth in the thumb and fingers. Dinner in larger households was in relays. Once the master, family and guests had dined, the servants ate what was left. At court, after the king and queen and courtiers had finished, the senior servants would take their places, followed by the junior servants, before the tables were dismantled and stored for the next meal. If any food were left, it was given to the poor. Ad Melita Thomas is the editor of Tudor Times. To find out more, visit www.tudortimes.co.uk",

        "title": "Richard III: latest DNA study  doesn t prove bones belong to former king",
        "content": "Michael Hicks, the recently retired head of history at the University of Winchester, told History Extra the new genealogical research  does not carry us any further forward . Ad The University of Leicester today announced that its latest analysis of all available evidence  confirms identity of King Richard III to the point of 99.999 per cent at its most conservative . The researchers collected DNA from living relatives of Richard III and analysed several genetic markers, including the complete mitochondrial genomes, inherited through the maternal line, and Y-chromosomal markers, inherited through the paternal line, from both the skeletal remains and the living relatives. The mitochondrial genome shows a genetic match between the skeleton and the maternal line relatives. However, Hicks said in response to the findings:  My line has always been that the bones may be Richard III s, but they cannot yet be proven to be. That is still the case, and is not altered [by this research].  The latest announcement is positive in that the bones are now linked to these two descendants of Richard III s sister Anne. We did not know that, but we had rather presumed this was so.  However, I don t think this research carries us any further forward. It tells us that the two modern relatives share the same mitochondrial DNA as the bones, not that the bones belong to Richard III.  Mitochondrial DNA is traced through the maternal line, and does not change over time. Richard III shared mitochondrial DNA with anyone in the direct female line from his sisters, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, great-great-grandmother etc. His mother had at least four sisters, leaving female descendants, Richard s great-grandmother, and others before her, currently unidentifiable.  Hicks told BBC History Magazine earlier this year that because mitochondrial DNA is traced through the maternal line, and does not change over time,  the DNA match from the Leicester skeleton could equally be the result of the bones being those of someone descended in the female line from Richard s mother, Cecily Neville, including her two daughters. \"It could also be those traceable from the other daughters of Cecily s mother, Joan Beaufort, any daughters of her grandmother Katherine Swynford, and so on.  Today, the historian added:  I m never convinced by DNA statistics: 99.999 per cent still leaves the possibility that two consecutive examples are the same.  There are two further problems with this data that cast doubt on its validity: the first is that the Y chromosome of the male line of the Plantagenets, represented by the Duke of Beaufort, should match with Richard III. There seems to be an assumption here that a break in the direct line male line must be in the Duke of Beaufort s family rather than in Richard s. Why not vice-versa?  If it doesn t match, it suggests the identification of Richard is wrong (and actually this has massive implications for the legitimacy of all English monarchs since Henry VII).  To clarify: one of the matches the researchers were seeking was between the Y chromosome from the bones and the Y chromosome of the male line of the Plantagenets, which today is represented by the Somerset family, including the Duke of Beaufort, who is descended via the bastard Charles Somerset from the Beaufort issue of John of Gaunt and thus Edward III. They did the test with various Somersets, which did not match the bones.  Leicester seems to say that the DNA from the bones are right, and that the Somerset line must have been broken by an illegitimacy   I thought the reverse as likely.  The article itself [published in the journal Nature Communications] allows for the possibility that the paternity break might be in either the descent of the bones or the Beauforts, but clearly prefers the former. It is perfectly possible to match in the female line   there must be dozens of Richard s contemporaries who do that   but not in the male line. Such persons, of course, are not Richard III.  The second problem is that we know what Richard looked like from the numerous portraits   black hair and brown eyes. I have previously criticised the reconstruction bust because, although the facial features may be scientific reconstructions from the skull, the colouring cannot be, and must have come from the portraits.  The suggestion that Richard was fair haired and blue eyed in his youth suggests the DNA of the modern descendants does not match the evidence of the best known portraits. Again, the assumption seems to be that the bones are Richard s, therefore the portrait that best fits the DNA results should be selected.  Leicester s latest findings were today published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications. Dr Turi King from the University of Leicester Department of Genetics, who led the research team, said:  Even with our highly conservative analysis, the evidence is overwhelming that these are indeed the remains of King Richard III, thereby closing an over 500 year old missing person s case.  In the video below, Professor Kevin Sch rer says: \"The fact that we have a break means just that   we have a break   it doesn't mean that the skeleton isn't Richard, because what we have is the very strong evidence triangulated with two living day relatives, with the mitochondrial DNA, so that in itself is very strong, compelling evidence that the skeleton is Richard III. \"The break, however, does raise other questions   more of a historical nature than 'is this skeleton Richard?'... this asks questions about the Plantagenets, and indeed the claims to the throne of both the houses of York and Lancaster.\"",

        "title": "How did Tutankhamun die?",
        "content": "In 1922, Howard Carter and his team made what would become perhaps the greatest archaeological discovery of all time. It was the intact tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty: Tutankhamun. The  boy-king  has since become one of the most famous figures from the ancient world and his face   more particularly his golden death mask   provides us with one of the most iconic images from anywhere, and at any time. Ad The Valley of the Kings was the burial place of the pharaohs throughout the great era we now call the New Kingdom (1550 1069 BC), and its use helps to define the period. Fast-forward 3,000 years, and the valley was the site of a series of spectacular discoveries in the 19th and early 20th centuries AD. A map made by Napoleon s scientific expedition in the early 1800s recorded the position of 16 tombs. By the time of the First World War, that number had risen to 61. The great American lawyer and patron of work in the valley, Theodore Davis, was responsible for many of the more recent of these discoveries, but in 1914, after a couple of disappointing seasons, he declared the valley to be  exhausted . Carter, however, thought otherwise, believing there still to be tombs left undiscovered, including that of Tutankhamun. Under the patronage of the 5th Earl of Carnarvon he began excavations in the valley in 1917. After a few unproductive seasons, and with Carnarvon s patience very nearly exhausted, he made the greatest discovery of them all. Tutankhamun: Life, Death & Legacy Introducing a brand-new podcast series exploring the life and legacy of the boy pharaoh Tutankhamun Listen to all episodes now Although he does not appear in any contemporary king-lists, scholars were aware of Tutankhamun prior to Carter s masterstroke, and that he had reigned at least into a ninth year. He was believed, correctly, to have been a king of the Amarna period (when the pharaohs  residence was sited in the city of Amarna). He was also noted for his role in reintroducing the worship of the god Amun, following the reign of his predecessor and probable father, Akhenaten, who had abandoned traditional Egyptian polytheism and introduced worship centred on the god Aten. This much is revealed by the fact that Tut changed his name at some point from Tutankhaten to Tutankhamun. A scattering of decorated blocks bearing Tutankhamun s inscriptions showed that he had been a builder, but otherwise he remained shrouded in mystery. Although the contents of his tomb were astonishing, they did not lead to any great leaps forward in what we know about the king or his times. This led Carter to lament that  of what he was and what he did we are still sadly to seek . The one element of the discovery that had the potential to tell us most about the life and death of the king was his mummified body. Tutankhamun s remains have been studied at first-hand on four occasions. First, on 11 November 1925, the body was examined by Carter and a team of forensic experts led by Douglas Derry, an anatomist at the Government School of Medicine in Cairo. In 1968 a team from Liverpool University, headed by Ronald Harrison, produced a series of x-ray images of the mummy, which enabled Egyptologists to carry out a more detailed study than had previously been possible. Then, in 1978, Dr James Harris conducted a closer examination of the skull and teeth, with the help of new x-ray technology. Finally, in 2005, a team led by Dr Zahi Hawass performed a CT scan of the mummy and, in doing so, generated the most detailed images of the body yet. Studies have established that Tutankhamun died between the ages of 17 and 19 Collectively, these studies have established that Tutankhamun died between the ages of 17 and 19, more or less as Carter and Derry had concluded, and was between 1.6 and 1.7 metres (5ft 2in and 5ft 6in) tall. Beyond this, however, very little is certain. There has been a great deal of speculation about the various medical conditions that may have afflicted Tutankhamun during his lifetime, and to what extent these contributed to his death. Possibilities suggested over the years include general physical weakness, perhaps caused by in-breeding within the royal family (which almost certainly did occur); pectus carinatum, or pigeon chest; and even  Tutankhamun syndrome , with symptoms such as breast development, sagging abdominal wall and flat feet. Secondary evidence, such as the presence of walking sticks in the tomb, and Tutankhamun s representation in the art of the times, has sparked further speculation. The debate has also been influenced by depictions of Akhenaten, who was often shown as being a grotesque, almost deformed figure. Yet, no one knows whether this was an attempt to capture the likeness of a king genuinely suffering from some kind of illness or a mere artistic convention. Foremost among the theories on Tutankhamun s death   at least in terms of the amount of attention it has gathered   is the idea that he may have been the victim of foul play. During the 1968 investigation, Harrison observed a small piece of bone inside, and apparently detached from, the skull. This led him to suggest that the king may have suffered a blow to the head, and others to conclude that this was evidence that the boy-king had been murdered. In light of further scrutiny of Harrison s x-rays and the 2005 CT scan data, most experts now agree that the detached bone was the result of a postmortem, and nothing whatsoever to do with the king s demise. Yet this still hasn t prevented the theory taking hold that he was murdered. Dr Hawass s investigations in 2005 led to a new theory gaining traction. The CT scans revealed that the king had suffered a fracture to the left femur. Perhaps more important was the observation that an amount of embalming fluid had entered the break. This suggested that the wound that caused it was still open at the time of death, and also that there were no signs that it had started to heal. On this basis, the fracture probably occurred in the last few days of the king s life. While this alone could not have killed the king, Hawass s team has suggested that the wound may have become infected, and that it was this that finally finished Tutankhamun off. Yet, even this has failed to persuade everyone. In a recent book on the subject, Hawass notes that his theory was not shared by every member of the team. At this point, it s worth emphasising just how unusual Tutankhamun s mummy is. It displays a series of highly unusual features, particularly around the torso, where a number of the ribs and a section of the left pelvis are completely missing. The embalming incision through which certain internal organs would have been removed   as was standard   is in the wrong place and considerably larger than normal; much of the soft tissue inside the chest cavity was removed and replaced with rolls of linen; and the arms were crossed in an unusually low position. Finally, the heart, which would not normally have been removed and which was crucial for the survival of the individual into the afterlife, was missing. It was clear that if these anomalies were the result of some kind of injury, they might well provide the clues as to the cause of death. But one question we have to answer is to what extent these injuries might have been caused by Carter and his team when they removed the mummy from its nest of coffins. Carter s notes on the process, which are freely accessible online thanks to the magnificent efforts of our colleagues at the Griffith Institute in Oxford, are full of references to the difficulties in separating each of Tutankhamun s three coffins, first of all from the sarcophagus and subsequently from one another. (The two smaller coffins sat snugly inside the largest one in a  Russian doll  arrangement.) The mummy itself was a very tight fit for the innermost coffin, and was stuck fast to the inside by a layer of embalming oil, which had been poured over the king s body. The team tried various methods to loosen it, and even left it out in the sun in the vain hope that the heat would help to melt the oils. Derry s autopsy had, in the end, to be carried out while the mummy was still in the coffin and the death mask still in place. Tutankhamun s body was adorned with jewels and other precious paraphernalia, much of which the team had difficulty in removing. At the time the body was reinterred in the tomb, having finally been unwrapped and lain on a sand bed, the king was still wearing a skull-cap and a beaded necklace. By the time of Harrison s examination in 1968, both were missing. Harrison s x-rays showed clearly the damage to the thorax and missing ribs, but this was something that Derry had not observed. This has led some to suggest that at some point the mummy was illicitly disturbed in order that the skull cap and necklace could be stolen, and that the robbers removed a section of the human remains, including the missing ribs, in order to free the booty. However, it is perfectly possible that Derry was unaware that the ribs were missing given he did not have the benefit of x-rays. What s more, there is evidence that they were removed in ancient times: while some of the ribs were broken, others were cut smoothly, and the linen packing beneath them was undisturbed. Egyptologist W Benson Harer argues that the direction of the cuts suggest they could only have been made prior to the body being packed, and also that the bones must have been fresh when this took place, as older bone cannot be cut so cleanly. Harer also suggests that the king s torso was damaged in a massive accident, which forced the embalmers to remove the ribs, heart and perhaps other parts of the soft tissue to give the body a superficially normal appearance in preparation for mummification. This is persuasive. But what kind of accident could have brought this about? While filming a 2013 Channel 4 documentary examining the death and burial of Tutankhamun, we ascertained that the damage to the mummy seemed to be concentrated around the left-hand side of the torso, from the clavicle downwards, as far as the pelvis: a tall, blunt object, it seemed, had struck the king with great force. No weaponry we knew of could have caused the necessary injury. However, we felt that another theory was worth investigating again: the possibility that Tutankhamun died in a chariot accident, and that, more specifically, the fatal impact was caused by a chariot wheel. A team from Advanced Simtech   a company that, among other things, provides computer-generated simulations of car crashes for the UK courts   used a replica New Kingdom chariot to model the maneuverability and maximum speed that could be achieved using one of these vehicles. (Several chariots were found in Tutankhamun s tomb, and were a common feature of the iconography of kingship during the New Kingdom.) This information, and what is known of the king s height and likely weight, was then used to test a series of accident scenarios to establish whether any could have produced the injuries Tutankhamun sustained. Given the forces involved, it was not difficult to create a situation that would have led to serious injury. In almost all cases, however, the most serious injury sustained would have been to the head and neck, and as we have seen, the mummy presents no clear evidence of any such trauma. However, one scenario did appear to result in precisely the injuries we had observed in the mummy. Had the king been kneeling or crouching down and struck by the wheel of the chariot, he would undoubtedly have suffered massive injuries to his torso; and crucially   although the head would, on impact, have been thrown violently forward   it would, at the last moment, have been pulled away before striking the wheel. The victim would undoubtedly have suffered from whiplash but by this point that would hardly have mattered. A team from Cranfield University was called upon to help ascertain whether the injuries sustained in such an accident would have been enough to cause the king s death. To do this, we needed to know what the effect of a chariot wheel impacting the human rib cage at high velocity would be. The team modelled the forces involved and conducted a test using the rib cage and flesh of a pig procured from a local butcher. Unsurprisingly the test showed that the impact would puncture the ribs and that the wheel would have penetrated the soft tissue underneath by at least an inch or two, enough to cause massive internal damage. In modern times, had paramedics been on hand quickly enough, there is a chance that the victim of such an accident could survive. In New Kingdom Egypt this would not have been the case. We can only speculate as to how the king might have come to be in such a position. He may have fallen out of his own chariot and been picking himself up when another came careering into him from behind. Or could, just could, he have been killed in battle? It had been thought for a long time that Tutankhamun had never been actively engaged in war   there was no clear evidence for it. But that has now changed. Dr Raymond Johnson of the University of Chicago has spent many years studying the decorated blocks scattered throughout the temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor, which represent the remains of now-dismantled temples. Many of these appear to have come from monuments erected by Tutankhamun and, after years of painstaking work piecing together these vast jigsaw puzzles, Dr Johnson has concluded that the young king may well have been actively engaged in battle. Several scenes have emerged, apparently showing a military campaign in Nubia. Another shows Tutankhamun in a chariot leading the Egyptian forces against a Syrian-style citadel. This strengthens the possibility that Tutankhamun may have been injured in a chariot accident on the battlefield. We cannot know for certain that this is what happened, but it is as credible as any other hypothesis put forward so far, and provides an explanation for the mummy s most puzzling anomalies. We have no idea, in fact, how the vast majority of Egyptian kings died but it s perhaps worth noting also that, in most other cases, few people have cared enough to ask the question. Tutankhamun, by contrast, continues to fascinate us. In terms of his life and achievements, the king remains almost as obscure as he was before his tomb was revealed. And yet its contents, including the remains of the man himself, have, more than 3,000 years after his demise, made him one of the most famous individuals ever to have lived. Like all ancient Egyptians, Tutankhamun would have wished for that very Egyptian immortality encapsulated in the phrase  to cause his name to live . Whatever his Earthly achievements, whatever the circumstances of his life and death, he has perhaps been more successful in this than anyone else from that great civilisation.

        "content": "Through isotope analysis of his bone and tooth material, researchers have uncovered previously unknown details about Richard III s earlier life, as well as evidence of change in the king s diet in later years. Ad The cutting-edge research, undertaken by the British Geological Society, looked at chemicals from the teeth, femur and ribs. The findings show there were substantial chemical changes in the king s rib bone, which renews itself relatively quickly and therefore provides an insight into the last two to five years of the king s life. The study is the most complete to have been conducted on a medieval monarch, providing a much more detailed insight into the diet and lifestyle of Britain s last Plantagenet king. The research also offers an insight into the different kinds of environments Richard lived in during his life. The chemicals found in the teeth indicate a change of location in his early childhood, and researchers can confirm he had moved from Fotheringay Castle in eastern England by the time he was seven. And by examining the femur, which represents an average of the 15 years before death, researchers show that Richard moved back to eastern England as an adolescent or young adult, and had a diet that matched the highest aristocracy. Richard Buckley from the University of Leicester Archaeological Services, and lead archaeologist in the Richard III dig, said:  This cutting edge research has provided a unique opportunity to shed new light on the diet and environment of a major historical figure   Richard III. It is very rare indeed in archaeology to be able to identify a named individual with precise dates and a documented life.  This has enabled the stable-isotope analysis to show how his environment changed at different time in his life and , perhaps most significantly, identified marked changes in his diet when he became king in 1483.  The latest findings, which are published in Elsevier s Journal of Archaeological Science, will feature in a Channel 4 documentary on Sunday 17 August at 9pm, Richard III: The New Evidence.

        "title": "8 historical events that happened in June",
        "content": "5 June 1832: Angry Parisians man the barricades Paris, 1832. In the Tuileries garden, the young writer Victor Hugo was strolling by the river when he heard gunshots: trouble was brewing in the working-class district of Les Halles. Hugo went to investigate. For 15 minutes he hid behind a pillar and watched as the king s soldiers fired on republican rebels. At last the battle moved away, giving Hugo the chance to make his escape. It was a moment that stayed with him for the rest of his life. Some 13 years later, he began work on a novel set in Paris during those tumultuous June days: Les Mis rables. Ad Today, thanks to the success of the musical and film versions, Les Mis rables is by far Hugo s best-known work. Many people assume that it is set during the French Revolution. In fact, the insurrection at its heart was a two-day uprising against the Orleanist king Louis-Philippe, which ended in failure. The June Rebellion was triggered by the food shortages of the late 1820s, a devastating cholera epidemic and the death of the popular general Jean Lamarque, who had become a hero to the working classes of Paris. At his funeral on 5 June, republican demonstrators rallied the crowds, waving red flags and calling for  liberty or death . The mood turned ugly, and by the evening rioters had taken control of much of central and eastern Paris, throwing up the barricades that play such a key role in Hugo s novel. It was all for nothing. The army stayed loyal to Louis-Philippe, and by morning the uprising had lost momentum. At the Clo tre Saint-Merri, the last demonstrators were surrounded by the king s troops. By nightfall it was all over. 26 June 1541: Francis Pizarro meets a bloody end over dinner Francisco Pizarro died as he had lived, sword in hand. Pizarro, who had defied the odds to bring down the Incas and conquer modern-day Peru for the Spanish, was almost 70 years old. As governor of New Castile (as Peru was then named), he had spent years locked in a bitter feud with a rival conquistador, Diego de Almagro. In 1538 Pizarro had had Almagro executed. But now the latter s son   also Diego   wanted revenge. Pizarro was dining in his palace in Lima when Almagro burst in with about 20 armed supporters. Most of the old man s guests fled, but Pizarro stood his ground, reaching for his sword from where it hung on the wall. According to one account, he struck down two would-be assassins and ran a third through. While he struggled to draw out his sword, however, Almagro s men stabbed him in the throat. Lying on the palace floor, Pizarro shouted:  Jesus!  The last thing he ever did was to draw a cross on the ground with his own blood and kiss it. The most ruthless conquistador of the age was dead. Pizarro s body was buried in Lima Cathedral, but it was not until 1977 that building workers found a lead box, bearing the inscription:  Here is the head of Don Francisco Pizarro Demarkes, Don Francisco Pizarro who discovered Peru and presented it to the crown of Castile.  Forensic scientists reported that the skull was broken by numerous violent blows   perhaps a fitting end for a man steeped in violence. Francisco Pizarro fights for his life in this 16th-century engraving. The Spanish conquistador died as he had lived   with his sword in his hand. (Bridgeman) 23 June 1940: Hitler crows over Paris It was about 5.30 in the morning when Adolf Hitler s plane landed at the edge of Paris. Three large Mercedes cars were waiting to take the conqueror into town, and the Nazi dictator knew exactly where he wanted to go first   the opera. As he told his minister, Albert Speer, Charles Garnier s neo-baroque opera house was his favourite building in Paris. And now that the French capital had fallen to Germany s all-conquering army, Hitler had the chance to live out a dream. Hitler s tour of Paris on 23 June 1940   the only time he visited the city   was one of the greatest days of his life. France lay prostrate at his feet, the shame of 1918 finally avenged. As he toured the city, posing for pictures by the Eiffel Tower, he discussed plans for a victory parade. Yet he concluded that it was a bad idea:  I am not in the mood for a victory parade. We aren t at the end yet.  Adolf Hitler takes in the sights of Paris in what would be the Nazi leader s only trip to the French capital.  Three hours in Paris  made him happy when he was at the height of his triumphs,  recalled Albert Speer. (AKG Images) To Speer, the Nazis  chief architect, Hitler waxed lyrical about the beauties of the French capital. But he was determined that Germany could do better.  Berlin,  he said later,  must be more beautiful. When we are finished in Berlin, Paris will be only a shadow.  Hitler s visit was astonishingly brief, and by nine in the morning he was already heading back to Germany.  It was the dream of my life to be permitted to see Paris,  he told Speer as they drove back to the airfield.  I cannot say how happy I am to have that dream fulfilled today.  Speer himself was struck by his master s mood.  For a moment,  he wrote later,  I felt something like pity for him: three hours in Paris, the one and only time he was to see it, made him happy when he stood at the height of his triumphs.  26 June AD 363: A Persian spear fells Rome's last pagan emperor In the spring of 363, the Roman emperor Julian invaded Persia. Having ruled Rome for less than two years, he felt that he needed to prove himself to the troops on the empire s eastern frontier. And what better way than by taking on their age-old enemies? On 5 March, around 60,000 Roman troops marched out of Antioch (near modern-day Antakya in Turkey), led by the emperor himself. At first everything went smoothly, and by mid-May Julian had crossed the Tigris and was outside the Persian capital, Ctesiphon. But then things began to go wrong. Harassed almost daily by Persian attacks, Julian ordered his army to retreat north, and at a minor engagement on 26 June, the worst happened. Julian had thrown himself into the fray, wrote Ammianus Marcellinus, a historian on the emperor s military staff,  when suddenly a cavalry spear, grazing the skin of his arm, pierced his side and fixed itself in the bottom of his liver . The wound did not at first seem serious; Julian s personal doctor washed it with wine, then tried to stitch up the organs. But the bleeding continued, and it became obvious that the emperor was failing. As he lay dying, wrote Ammianus, Julian  entered into an intricate discussion with the philosophers Maximus and Priscus on the sublime nature of the soul . This seems a bit unlikely. It was inevitable that the last non-Christian emperor would get short shrift from Christian writers, so Ammianus, a fellow pagan, was probably gilding the lily.  At last,  the historian went on,  the swelling of his veins began to choke his breath and, having drank some cold water, which he had asked for, he expired quietly about midnight, in the 31st year of his age.  16 June 1883: 183 children crushed to death in concert tragedy The poster for Sunderland s Victoria Hall seemed wonderfully enticing.  On Saturday Afternoon at 3 o clock,  it said,  the Fays from the Tynemouth Aquarium Will Give a Grand Day Performance for Children   The Greatest Treat for Children Ever Given.  There would, it added, be prizes,  a handsome Present, Books, Toys, &c . When Mr and Mrs Fay took the stage on 16 June 1883, an estimated 2,000 children were packed into the concert hall. The interior of the Victoria Hall in Sunderland, as depicted in a 19th-century illustration. The tragedy that befell the hall in 1883 touched the hearts of people across Britain, including Queen Victoria. (AKG Images) What followed was a tragedy of heartbreaking proportions. At the end of the show, an announcer declared that children with specially numbered tickets would get a prize on the way out. Meanwhile, performers began handing out treats to children in the front row. Many of the 1,100 children in the gallery rushed towards the stairs, worried they were going to miss out. At the bottom, however, they found a narrow door, bolted to allow only one child through at a time. As more children stampeded down the stairs, a crush began to develop. Parents rushed to help, but could not get near the door. Children started falling, bodies piling up near the door. By now it was obvious that a terrible disaster was under way. In all, 183 children died that day, some as young as three. In the aftermath, legislation provided for better emergency exits, with doors opening outwards, not inwards. Queen Victoria sent a heartfelt letter of condolence quoting the words of Jesus:  Suffer little children to come unto me... for such is the Kingdom of God.  18 June 1178: Monks witness an extraordinary lunar event On 18 June 1178, Gervase of Canterbury heard an extraordinary story. Gervase, who had been ordained by Thomas Becket, spent much of his time compiling a detailed chronicle of English history. But nothing could have prepared him for the account reported to him that night by five fellow monks. Some time after sunset, the monks had noticed something extraordinary in the sky.  Now,  Gervase wrote,  there was a bright new moon  its horns were tilted toward the east; and suddenly the upper horn split in two. From the midpoint of the division a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out, over a considerable distance, fire, hot coals, and sparks. Meanwhile the body of the moon which was below writhed, as it were, in anxiety, and to put it in the words of those who reported it to me and saw it with their own eyes, the moon throbbed like a wounded snake.  This extraordinary sight, he noted,  was repeated a dozen times or more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random and then returning to normal. Then after these transformations the moon from horn to horn, that is along its whole length, took on a blackish appearance. Today, many lunar experts believe the monks had been watching the formation of the moon s enormous Giordano Bruno crater, named after an Italian philosopher. It was probably created by the impact of an asteroid or comet, which would explain the burst of molten matter seen by the monks   though they, of course, had no way of understanding what it was they had witnessed. 11 June 323 BC: Alexander the Great dies after drinking binge Alexander of Macedon, master of the world from the shores of the Adriatic to the mountains of Afghanistan, spent the early summer of 323 BC in Babylon. Only a year before, his troops had persuaded him to turn back from a planned invasion of India. But already he was planning new conquests, hoping to strike at the heart of Arabia. On top of that, the 32-year-old king was pressing forward with his plans to integrate Persians and Macedonians, even urging his officers to take Persian wives. And then, some time around the beginning of June, disaster struck. Accounts of Alexander s death differ widely. The most popular, told by the historian Plutarch, holds that he was taken ill after a drinking session with his friend Medius of Larissa. In the next few days, Alexander developed a fever. Although he managed to put in an appearance before his worried troops, his condition worsened until he could no longer speak. At last, some time in the night between 10 and 11 June, he died. Mourners lament the death of Alexander the Great in this 14th-century copy of a fifth-century Armenian manuscript. Did he fall prey to typhoid, malaria or poison? (Alamy) Since so many Macedonian rulers fell victim to assassination, speculation has long surrounded Alexander s death. Many historians have suggested that he may have been poisoned by rivals within the Macedonian elite or by officers outraged by his Persian affectations. The true explanation may be more prosaic. In the festering heat of summer in Babylon, the hard-drinking Alexander may well have succumbed to typhoid or malaria. His death had a shattering impact. Within weeks the Macedonian empire was already falling apart, as his officers began to carve out their own rival dominions. Even Alexander s sarcophagus, hijacked and taken to Alexandria, became a weapon in the civil war.  I foresee great contests,  he is supposed to have said,  at my funeral games.  He was right. 4 June 1989: Hundreds die in Tiananmen Square By the beginning of June 1989, Tiananmen Square, in the centre of Beijing, was packed with demonstrators. After weeks of mounting protests, with students and dissidents at the forefront, the Chinese communist government had declared martial law and sent some 250,000 troops to the capital   but still the crowds refused to disperse. On 2 June party leaders, including the country s effective leader, Deng Xiaoping, agreed that it was time to crack down. Tiananmen Square, they agreed, must be cleared, so that  the riot can be halted and order restored to the capital . The following evening, 3 June, troops and tanks thundered into the centre of Beijing, as state television warned residents to stay in their homes. By about 10 o clock, reports were emerging of bloodshed at major intersections on the roads into the city. Inside Tiananmen Square, some 70,000 people stood and waited. Then, just after midnight, the first armoured vehicle appeared from the west. Some students threw stones and bricks, while others tried to prevent them; it was vital, they said, that their protest remained non-violent. What followed remains the single most controversial moment in China s recent history. In the early hours of 4 June, the army cleared the square by force. Government officials initially claimed the action resulted in no deaths   later revised to about 200; other estimates suggest that as many as 1,000 people lost their lives. Either way, the result was the same: the protesters had been defeated. One image, taken the next day, captured the terrible drama: a photograph of a lone man, holding two shopping bags, standing in front of a column of tanks. Who he was, and what he was doing, remains uncertain. At the time, there were rumours that he was arrested and dragged before a firing squad. We may well never know.

        "title": "Elizabeth I s war with England s Catholics",
        "content": "In 1828, builders removing a lintel over a doorway at Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire were surprised to see an old, beautifully bound book come down with the rubble. They decided to investigate and knocked through a thick partition wall, exposing a recess, about 5 feet long and 15 inches wide. Inside, wrapped up in a large sheet, was an enormous bundle of papers and books that had once belonged to Sir Thomas Tresham, a Catholic gentleman in the reign of Elizabeth I. Ad There have been other discoveries in other counties: a secret room chanced upon by a boy exploring a derelict wing of Harvington Hall, near Kidderminster, in 1894; a small wax disc bearing the imprint of a cross and a lamb (an Agnus Dei), found in a box nailed to a joist by an electrician working in the attic of Lyford Grange, Berkshire, in 1959; and a  pedlar s chest  containing vestments, a chalice and a portable altar, bricked in at Samlesbury Hall, Lancashire. Each bears testimony to the resourcefulness and courage with which Catholic men and women tried to keep their faith in Protestant England. Under Elizabeth I, Catholics grew adept at concealment. Their lifeblood   the Mass   was banned. Anyone who heard it risked a fine and prison. Hence the need for secret Mass-kits and altar-stones small enough to slip into the pocket. Their priests   essential agents of sacramental grace   were outlawed. Reconciling anyone to Rome (and, indeed, being reconciled) was made treason. After 1585, any priest ordained abroad since 1559, and found on English soil, was automatically deemed a traitor and his lay host a felon, both punishable by death. Hence the need for priest-holes, like the one at Harvington Hall, or at Hindlip, where a feeding tube was embedded in the masonry. Read more | A perilous game of hide and seek: the history of priest holes and hunters Even personal devotional items like rosary beads or the Agnus Dei found at Lyford were regarded with suspicion, since a statute of 1571 had ruled that the receipt of such  superstitious  items, blessed by the pope or his priests, would lead to forfeiture of lands and goods. It is impossible to know how many Catholics there were in Elizabethan England, for few were willing to be categorised and counted. John Bossy (defining a Catholic as one who habitually, though not necessarily regularly, used the services of a priest) estimated some 40,000 in 1603, less than one per cent of the population. This was not a homogenous group, rather a wide and wavering spectrum of experience. Many were branded  church papists : they attended official services according to law, but some conformed only occasionally or partially. William Flamstead read his book during the sermon  in contempt of the word preached , while for two decades of attendance Sir Richard Shireburn blocked his ears with wool. Parishioners might refuse Protestant communion or they might hide the bread up their sleeve to dispose of later. Mrs Kath Lacy from the East Riding of Yorkshire trod it  under her foot . Other wives avoided church altogether and, since their husbands owned the property, they often escaped prosecution.  Such here have a common saying,  groused one Northamptonshire official in 1599,  the unbelieving husband shall be saved by the believing wife.  At the disobedient end of the spectrum were those individuals (8,590 recorded in 1603) who staunchly adhered to the Roman church s insistence that compliance was an insult to the faith. They were known as recusants (from the Latin recusare: to refuse) and they paid a high price for their  obstinacy . In 1559 the fine for missing church was 12 pence. In 1581 it was raised to a crippling 20 pounds. In 1587 enforcement became much stricter with the introduction of cumulative monthly fines and the forfeiture of two-thirds of a defaulting recusant s estate.Lord Vaux of Harrowden was reduced to pawning his parliamentary robes; poorer folk did not have that luxury. What recusants publicly requested   freedom of worship and the right to abstain from official church services   may not sound unreasonable, but this was the age of Inquisition, of conquistadors, religious wars and, in the case of Elizabeth s half-sister Mary I, human bonfires. Elizabeth was a divine-right queen with a sworn duty to maintain the one true faith but, unlike Mary, she had conformed during her predecessor s reign. She did not like  to make windows into men s hearts and secret thoughts  noted the oft-misquoted Francis Bacon, but she expected outward obedience, in church and state. Illegitimate pretender On 25 February 1570, Pope Pius V issued a bull of excommunication against Elizabeth I. In late support of the 1569 northern rebellion (led by the Catholic earls of Northumberland and Westmorland and crushed with ruthless efficiency   450 executions under martial law is the conservative estimate), the bull declared Elizabeth an illegitimate pretender and bound her subjects to disobey her, upon pain of anathema (a formal curse by the pope). A later resolution from Pius s successor, Gregory XIII, allowing for provisional obedience  under present circumstances , did not alter the fundamental message. It was impossible, wrote the Privy Council clerk, Robert Beale,  that they should love her, whose religion founded in the pope s authority maketh her birth and title unlawful . There was, indeed, some rancour towards the queen. In 1591, the recusant gentleman Swithin Wells retorted to a jibe about papists having been begotten by bulls with the words:  If we have bulls to our fathers, thou hast a cow to thy mother.  He swiftly apologised and the circumstances were exceptional: Wells was just about to swing for the crime of priest-harbouring. But even a self-fashioned loyalist like Sir Thomas Tresham privately entertained hostile views on the  bastardised  Elizabeth. Conflicted loyalties caused considerable anguish, as evinced by the desperately sad letter that the 24-year-old convert Robert Markham wrote to his parents in 1594.  Every hour presents a hell unto me  In the night, I cannot sleep or take any rest, so monstrous is the horror of my conscience.  He pledged never to fight against Elizabeth, nor to have any truck with conspiracy.  I am,  he declared,  and will be as good a subject to her Majesty as any in England.  But there had to be a caveat:  My conscience only reserve I to myself, whereupon dependeth my salvation.  Markham chose exile, like many others, some of whom became radicalised by the experience. The Catholics who stayed at home used various methods to sustain their faith, from spiritual reading, prayer and meditation to the preservation of rosaries and relics. They were advised to internalise their devotions. For instance, certain spots in the garden could be linked to different saints, so that walks would become,  as it were, short pilgrimages . But there was no substitute for the sacraments and, although some erstwhile Marian priests continued to minister in secret, it was only when William Allen s seminary boys started coming off the boats in 1574 that Catholic hopes   and government fears   were revived. The first English missionaries came from Douai in Flanders, where William Allen, the former principal of St Mary Hall, Oxford, had founded a college in 1568. In June 1580, they were joined in England by the Jesuits, members of a dynamic religious order founded in the furnace of the Reformation.  We travelled only for souls,  insisted Edmund Campion at his execution at Tyburn on 1 December 1581,  we touched neither state nor policy.  These were indeed the instructions that this Jesuit and his co-missioner, Robert Persons, had carried from Rome. But they were also armed with faculties to print books anonymously, they insisted upon absolute recusancy and they challenged the state to a public debate. Campion s  brag  chilled his adversaries:  Touching our Society, be it known unto you that we have made a league   all the Jesuits in the world, whose succession and multitude must overreach all the practices of England   cheerfully to carry the cross that you shall lay upon us and never to despair your recovery while we have a man left to enjoy your Tyburn, or to be racked with your torments, or to be consumed with your prisons. The expense is reckoned, the enterprise is begun; it is of God, it cannot be withstood. So the faith was planted, so it must be restored.  Campion was one of about 130 priests executed for religious treason in Elizabeth s reign. A further 60 of their lay supporters were also put to death. Torture was used more than in any other English reign. Margaret Ward, destined for the gallows for organising the escape of a priest, protested that  the queen herself, if she had the bowels of a woman, would have done as much if she had known the ill-treatment he underwent . But it was the heart and stomach of a king that were required for England s defence. Assassination attempts With no named successor, and a Catholic heir presumptive   Mary, Queen of Scots   waiting, wings clipped but ready to soar, Elizabeth I was vulnerable to conspiracy. The security of the realm depended entirely on her personal survival in an age that saw brother rulers taken by bullet and blade. The assassination in 1584 of William of Orange, the Dutch Protestant figurehead shot in the chest by a Catholic fanatic chasing the bounty of Philip II of Spain, was particularly alarming. The following year, parliament passed a statute licensing the revenge killing of assassins, or witting beneficiaries of assassins, in the event of a successful attempt on the queen s life. The threat from Spain, the papacy, the French house of Guise and the agents of Mary, Queen of Scots was very real and seemingly unceasing. From the sanctuary of exile, William Allen agitated for an invasion of England and frequently exaggerated the extent of home support. Only fear made Catholics obey the queen, he assured the pope in 1585,  which fear will be removed when they see the force from without . The priests, he added, would direct the consciences and actions of Catholics  when the time comes . In reality, there were very few Elizabethans willing to perpetrate what would now be called an act of terror. But there was a vast grey area that encompassed all kinds of suspicious activity   communication with the queen s enemies, the handling of tracts critical of the regime, the non-disclosure of sensitive information, the sheltering and funding of priests who turned out to be subversive. Even the quiescent majority was feared for what it might do if there was ever a confrontation between Elizabeth I and the pope. Catholic attempts on the queen s life Elizabeth s advisors foiled a series of assassination plots Spain plans an invasion, 1571 Named after the Florentine merchant who acted as the go-between for the Duke of Norfolk, Mary Stuart, Philip II and the pope, the Ridolfi plot was a plan for a Spanish invasion of England and the substitution of Elizabeth with Mary. Roberto Ridolfi was known to the English government and met with Elizabeth before heading for Rome. The plot was foiled upon the arrest of a courier at Dover. Norfolk was executed, Mary survived and Ridolfi later emerged as a papal senator. He clearly relished intrigue. Throckmorton s sorry end, 1583 Francis Throckmorton was the linkman for a plot that might be seen as part of a continuum of intrigues sponsored by the powers of Catholic Europe in the 1580s. The aim, as with the Ridolfi plot, was the overthrow of Elizabeth and the restoration of Catholicism in England. Mary Stuart s kinsman, the Duke of Guise, was set to invade at Arundel, but the plan was aborted upon Throckmorton s arrest in November 1583. Throckmorton was  somewhat pinched  (ie tortured) and executed the following July. The lone extremist blows his cover, 1583 Not every attempt on Elizabeth s life strained the sinews of Europe s whisperers and watchers. John Somerville, a distant kinsman (by marriage) of William Shakespeare, seems only to have had a  frantic humour  and a pistol in his pocket when he set off from his home in Warwickshire to kill the queen. He failed because he broadcast his intentions en route, but, as events elsewhere proved (see page 54), it only took one extremist, bent on martyrdom and blind to worldly consequence, to effect an assassination. Walsingham ensnares Mary Stuart, 1586 The plot that brought down Mary Stuart was, from the outset, a conspiracy to assassinate Elizabeth. Anthony Babington was not its chief architect, though it was his letter of 6 July 1586 that floated to Mary the plan for  the dispatch of the usurper . The plot was uncovered   and arguably fomented   using an agent provocateur, intercepts (via the bung-hole of a beer keg) and forgery. Whatever the ethics of the sting, the plot was real. Priests were involved and Mary, executed on 8 February 1587, was complicit. Jesuits prepare to strike   or do they? 1594 Elizabeth s last decade saw court rivalry seep into intelligence work and the result was an occasional   and occasionally deliberate   blurring of perception and reality. Immediately after the Earl of Essex s exposure of a dubious poison plot, the queen s adviser William Cecil went one up with a Jesuit conspiracy involving several Irish soldiers, whose confessions seemed remarkably fortuitous, if somewhat muddled. Two of the assassins-designate were known to Cecil. One he had not deemed a significant threat; the other was an informant and possible plant. When asked the  bloody questions , framed to extract ultimate allegiances, Catholics proved as adept as their queen at the  answer answerless . Spies and agent provocateurs were thrown into the field, moles were placed in embassies and recusant houses were searched for priests and  popish trash . The queen s agents were sometimes overzealous, sometimes downright immoral, in their pursuit of national security.  There is less danger in fearing too much than too little,  advised the queen s spymaster, Francis Walsingham. In 1588, when the Spanish Armada beat menacingly towards the English Channel, the  most obstinate and noted  recusants were rounded up and imprisoned. Sir Thomas Tresham begged for a chance to prove his  true English heart  and fight for his queen. He vigorously disputed the claim that  while we lived, her Majesty should not be in security, nor the realm freed from invasion . Nevertheless, the Spaniards sailing aboard the Rosario were told to expect support from at least a third of England s population. Elizabeth s Privy Council was  certain  that an invasion would  never  have been attempted,  but upon hope  of internal assistance. It may have been a false hope, built on a house of cards by  migr s desperate to see the old faith restored at home, but for as long as it was held, and acted upon, by backers powerful enough to do damage, Tresham and the rest, whether  faithfullest true English subjects  or not, were indeed a security risk. England s victory in 1588 was celebrated as the triumph of Christ over Antichrist, the true church over the false, freedom over tyranny. Elizabeth I was hailed as Gloriana, the Virgin Queen who  brought up, even under her wing, a nation that was almost begotten and born under her, that never shouted any other Ave than for her name . There was no place for rosaries in this predestined, Protestant version of English history. Even Philip II, usually so sure of his status as the special one, was momentarily confounded by the mysteries of God s will. He soon rallied, however, and there were more failed armadas. At every whisper of invasion, the screw was turned on those  bad members  known to be recusants. In 1593, the  statute of confinement  ruled that recusants could not travel beyond five miles of their home without a licence. Observance could be patchy and enforcement slack. Anti-Catholicism was nearly always more passionate in the abstract than it was on the ground, but it still must have been alienating and psychologically draining to be spied on, searched, and branded an  unnatural subject  at every critical juncture. Tresham likened it to being  drenched in a sea of shameless slanders . Tresham outlived Queen Elizabeth by two years. His hope for a measure of toleration under James VI and I did not materialise and, having paid a total of  7,717 in recusancy penalties, he died on 11 September 1605 a disappointed man. The following month, his wife s nephew,  Robin  Catesby, tried to recruit his son, Francis, into the Gunpowder Plot. Francis Tresham was arrested on 12 November and died before he could face trial. On, or soon after 28 November 1605, the family papers were bundled up in a sheet and immured at Rushton Hall. They lay there, undisturbed, for over two centuries, until, in 1828, the builders came in.

        "content": "A search for the remains of Henry I s  lost  abbey could confirm the whereabouts of the 12th-century king s sarcophagus   and, in parallels with the recent search for Richard III, it s possible that it could be located beneath what is now a car park. Ad The Hidden Abbey Project aims to uncover the full extent of Reading Abbey, which was largely destroyed in 1539 during the dissolution of the monasteries. It has been instigated by Philippa Langley, well known for leading the search for Richard III s remains in Leicester. Langley has secured the support of Historic England   formerly known as English Heritage   and in 2016 the project team will carry out ground-penetrating radar (GPR) research of the abbey area, followed by  trial trenching  to estimate the site s archaeological potential. It is hoped that the imaging might show sarcophagus burials, possibly including that of Henry.  There is believed to be a pristine Cluniac abbey layout buried beneath the ground at Reading,  Langley told BBC History Magazine.  One of the main aims of the project is to confirm the exact positioning of the abbey church, as well as its size and structure. Sarcophagus burials tend to show up very clearly in GPR research, and potentially we might be able to see several.  What s really exciting is that we know that Henry was buried in front of the high altar, with members of his family buried in specific locations around him. The thinking in Reading, using current estimates of the size of the abbey, is that this burial spot is located beneath a school. If the abbey is larger, it could be situated underneath either what is today a playground or a car park. That option is considered less likely, but if Henry s tomb is beneath the car park, that will be very interesting.  Henry founded Reading Abbey in 1121 as a royal mausoleum, and is buried there along with his second wife, Adeliza, and great-grandson William of Poitiers. Langley is eager to stress that, while the potential to find his sarcophagus burial is exciting, the main aim of the project is to find out as much as possible about the abbey itself   and what happens next will be the decision of Historic England. A nearby playground and car park may yield new clues about the location of the king s lost sarcophagus. Credit Philippa Langley She does, however, acknowledge striking similarities between Reading s story and that of Leicester, particularly as there is speculation about the whereabouts of Henry s remains. An unreliable 19th-century story suggests that workmen   likely acting on Edward VI s instructions   targeted the abbey in the 1550s for a silver casket in which the king was supposedly buried, and that his remains were discarded in the process.  The exact location of Richard III s remains was unknown, and here too we have a story of a king s bones possibly being lost,  she says. Much like Richard, Henry was the youngest son who rose to become king. And, as with Richard, Henry s character continues to be hotly disputed: some historians believe he was a cruel and ambitious usurper, while others see him as an enlightened and educated peacemaker. The people of Reading want to tell this extraordinary story, and I want to help to get it out there.  Judith Green, emeritus professor of medieval history at the University of Edinburgh, agrees that the research will be important for the field.  It would be interesting to know how much of Henry s body was actually buried at Reading, because he died in western France after eating lampreys   jawless fish,  she says.  After his death, with the weather too poor to travel to Reading, his body was taken to Rouen where it was embalmed. His intestines, brain and eyes were buried locally and, weeks later, the rest of his body was taken back to Reading. This was the first time the body of an English king had been treated in this way.  A divisive king The youngest of William the Conqueror s four sons, Henry I reigned from 1100 to 1135. He is sometimes considered a usurper, because his elder brother Robert Curthose arguably had a more legitimate claim to the throne, but Henry had himself crowned while Robert was away on crusade. Regarded as playing a key role in stabilising Norman England, Henry increased royal revenues, established peaceful relations with Scotland through his marriage to Mathilda of Scotland, and through his Charter of Liberties   described by some historians as a forerunner of Magna Carta   bound himself to laws concerning the treatment of nobles and church officials. Ad He could, however, also be cruel. He famously cut off the noses of two of his illegitimate granddaughters and blinded them in reprisal for a similar act against a child being held hostage by one of his enemies.",

        "title": "Bad King Richard III?  He was a product of his time. I ve warmed to him  says relative Michael Ibsen",
        "content": "In 2004, as she sat down to dinner with her husband in a small town in Ontario, Canada, Michael Ibsen s mother, Joy, received the most curious of phonecalls. At the other end of the line was British historian John Ashdown-Hill, who told her she might be related to Richard III s sister. Ad Joy was informed she had been tracked down as part of a project to identify the possible remains of Margaret of York, sister of Richard III and Edward IV. Ashdown-Hill had traced an all-female line of descent from another sister, Anne of York, to the retired Canadian journalist, and wanted to know if she would consider giving a DNA sample. This was how Joy s son, Michael Ibsen, a cabinet-maker living in Paddington, came to later discover he was a descendant of Richard III. In 2012, following the death of his mother four years earlier, Michael provided a DNA sample to help the University of Leicester team with testing in the event that any remains were found at the Grey Friars church site. If researchers were to find remains, Michael s mitochondrial DNA [which is traced through the maternal line from mother to child, and does not change over time], could help to determine their identity. In Leicester on Wednesday, less than 24 hours before Richard III s reinterment, we spoke to Michael about being related to such a divisive monarch, and found out what it was like to design and make the king s coffin  Q: What has this experience been like for you? A: It s been an interesting journey. Because it s been spread out over such a long period of time [Michael s mother was first contacted in 2004], there have been these bursts of activity in terms of interest from the media. I ve been asked a lot by people outside [Leicester] cathedral this week  how has this changed your life?  It hasn t really changed my life at all, but it s fascinating to be part of history. It s leapt out of the pages of a book   like something out of Indiana Jones, in a way! It s a great privilege to be involved in something like this   it s fascinating. But the intensity of this week has taken me by surprise. On Sunday [when Richard III s coffin was taken from the University of Leicester on an all-day procession, attended by tens of thousands of people], I found myself sat in front of this wall of media, half a metre from a coffin that I had made that contained the remains of Richard III. I just sat there thinking  how on earth did I come to be here? What a strange sequence of events . During the procession, a number of roads were closed so my brother and sister and I just had to get out and walk like everyone else. It was great because no one noticed us. People were following the cortege, moving towards the cathedral, and although my brother and sister and I are not particularly emotional people, we found ourselves caught up in this strange atmosphere of wonder. The whole thing has been such a strange series of coincidences and things coming together, one after another   the science, the archaeology. It s extraordinary. Richard III's coffin in Leicester Cathedral, the day before his reinterment Q: When did you first learn that you were related to Richard III? A: Initially in 2004 my mother didn t tell anyone other than my brother about John Ashdown-Hill s phone call. My brother specialises in privacy issues associated with medical information, so he spent some time looking into it before my mother provided a DNA sample. It wasn t until a few months later, when we were all together as a family, that she announced that she was descended from Anne of York and related to Richard III. Of course, we as offspring, were similarly related. You have to remember that at that point we didn t know anything about the possible excavations to search for Richard III   he was just a figure in the distant past. And we knew that possibly millions of other people might be related to him in the same way. It wasn t until the prospect of the dig became a reality, and the business of the mitochondrial DNA connection being a valid aspect of the story, that our ears pricked up and we became a lot more interested. The Leicester team asked me to be present on the first day of the dig, but I went home afterwards thinking  good luck to them , doubting that they would find anything. I had no idea at the time that they had unearthed Richard already [Richard III s remains were discovered six hours, 33 minutes and 13 seconds in to the dig, at just after 3pm on Saturday 25 August 2012]. They were very good at keeping that quiet! Following the public announcement of the discovery of remains in October 2012, it all went from there. Q: Did you know much about Richard III before all this? A: I knew what probably everyone else knew: that he was a king of England with a bad reputation, largely because of the princes in the Tower. In my twenties I read The Daughter of Time by Josephine Tey [1951], which, of course, is about a modern detective, Alan Grant, trying to solve the mystery of the princes in the Tower. The book stimulated an interest in the period for me, and I went to see for myself the portrait of Richard III that features in it, which is housed at the National Portrait Gallery [in the novel, Grant becomes engrossed in the portrait]. I used to go once a year just to have a look at the painting, for no particular reason. I now think  how odd that for 20 or so years I ve been going to look at this portrait, and then suddenly Richard becomes a presence in my life . Q: What was it like to design and make Richard III s coffin? A: The team asked me more than a year ago whether I would consider doing it. It was all under the radar at first, so I couldn t talk to anyone about it. It was an interesting process   I wanted to first look into the history and find out what Richard s coffin would have looked like, if he had had one. So I got in touch with an expert in burial customs and he very helpfully found out for me that at the time it was highly unusual for people to have had a coffin   certainly a wooden coffin. So it seemed to me that we had more of an open brief historically in terms of what we could do with the coffin. I had at that point already designed something that really looked more like a piece of furniture [than a coffin], so I ripped up the design and came up with something much simpler. I wanted people to be able to identify with it in some basic way. I thought, first of all,  if Richard III had had a coffin it would probably have been made with English oak , which I understand was used for high status funerals. Oak is embedded in the British psyche in some curious way. The inside of the coffin is made with yew, which was used to make longbows and has a sort of mystical sense to it   it s found in churchyards, and was associated with funerals for centuries, I gather. I wanted people to see these materials used very simply but sourced from the best possible woodlands and of the best quality. I was very fortunate because I was in touch with a sawmill that had contacts with the Duchy of Cornwall, so we were able to source the oak from one of the ancient woodlands that belonged to the Duchy of Cornwall in Herefordshire [the Duchy's Harewood End Estate]. This was a wonderful link, because the Duke of Cornwall was also the Prince of Wales, and guess who the Prince of Wales was during Richard s reign? It was Richard s young son [who was given the title before he died as a child, probably of tuberculosis]. Therefore, Richard s son, as the Duke of Cornwall, would have inherited the Duchy of Cornwall estates when he came of age. So you have this wonderful connection   Richard being buried in timber sourced from the Duchy of Cornwall woodlands. It honours Richard, I hope. Richard III s coffin was taken from the University of Leicester on an all-day procession on Sunday. (DARREN STAPLES/WPA Rota/Press Association Images) Q: You earlier described Richard as a king with  a bad reputation . Does it bother you that you are related to such a controversial king? A: Obviously it would be nice to be related to a more benign monarch, as it were! But I sometimes say to people  who would you rather be related to: Henry VIII or Richard III?  I mean, Henry VIII didn t exactly have a great reputation either! But I think one of the great things about this whole episode is that it s forcing people to rethink what s been written about Richard III, and about his reign and his life. My own reading is that Richard was very much a product of his time. How do you look at medieval life through 21st-century eyes? What we would find utterly unacceptable was probably just part of everyday life for many people back then. And vice versa   medieval people looking at our society would certainly have questions: what place does the church have in people s lives now compared to back then, for example? Over the past year-and-a-half I ve warmed to Richard III in a way I perhaps hadn t before. Q: How do you feel about seeing this experience come to an end, now that Richard III is being reinterred? A: Everything will quieten down and I ll go back to my day-to-day life, which is fine, but I ll have the memory of it. I ll still be able to pop up to Leicester to see the many friends that I ve made at the university, the council, and the cathedral. And above all I like to think I can come and sit in a corner of the cathedral and look at the tomb and think  there, under the floor, is the coffin I made containing Richard III .

        "title": "What has the discovery of Richard III's remains taught us?",
        "content": "The discovery of Richard III s remains beneath a Leicester car park in 2012 is one of the biggest historical stories of the past decade. Carried out by the Looking for Richard Project and archaeologists from the University of Leicester, the dig and subsequent research sparked debate about what new details the bones could reveal about the man, his life and legacy   and whether these bones were even the king s. Here, historians and experts share their views on the implications of the investigation, and why laying the body to rest may not be the end of the saga. Ad Dan Jones:  This discovery shows what 21st-century science has to offer historians  The wealth of information harvested from Richard s bones and grave is amazing, and shows just how much 21st- century science has to offer historians. I don t just mean the DNA work that identified the remains as the king s. Careful analysis of the skeleton diagnosed Richard s spinal deformity as idiopathic scoliosis, and told us much about the wounds he suffered at the battle of Bosworth in 1485. We learned that the king probably had blue eyes, and was a blond-haired child. Soil analysis told us he had roundworm in his gut. Dental examination suggests he ground his teeth. Isotope analysis of his ribs revealed that his diet got richer in later life. It s a great interdisciplinary case study   and it offers a tantalising glimpse of what we could learn if we opened other monarchs  tombs. The 18th- and 19th-century vogue for peering into ancient royal graves is long gone. Yet how much more we could find out today! Paradoxically, at a time when we could know so much about the dead, we have grown incredibly prissy about disturbing them. Shame. Dan Jones is the author of The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses and the Rise of the Tudors (Faber and Faber, 2014) Philippa Langley:  We were able to disprove myths that had become truths  The Looking For Richard Project began where the study of our past always begins: with open minds and questions. Everyone in Leicester told us that the king s body had been dug up and thrown into the river Soar; we proved that the age-old story was false, dreamed up to suit a reputation that people had been led to believe. We questioned that reputation, too, by commissioning a psychological analysis of the king by two leading academics, Mark Lansdale and Julian Boon, which is available to read online. By questioning, we were able to uncover the real Richard and disprove many of the myths that surrounded him   myths that had, over time, become  truths . Our years of work brought extraordinary results, demonstrating what can be achieved when preconceptions are set aside. This year we commemorate finding Richard III; who knows what still waits to be discovered? It s my prediction that the study of late medieval England will never be the same again. Philippa Langley led the search for Richard III through the Looking For Richard Project, and co-authored The King s Grave: The Search for Richard III (2013), and Finding Richard III: The Official Account (2014) Mike Pitts:  A distant medieval monarch has been revealed as one of us  There was great excitement when archaeologists announced that a king s remains had been found in Leicester. Many experts, however, were sceptical: what new would we learn? The historian and broadcaster Mary Beard, for instance, wondered on Twitter whether the discovery had  any HISTORICAL significance?  To counter such doubts, we might note the positive, practical outcomes. The Richard III Society, Channel 4, the University of Leicester and the city of Leicester itself, to name but a few of those closely involved, have all benefited. The university, for example, estimated that immediate press coverage was worth  2m to it. Such things matter. But we have, in fact, also gained new insights into Richard III and contemporary historical documents. And I think that we have understood something greater still. The tawdry details of Richard s grave, and the immediacy of bones, wounds and dirt, have touched people in ways beyond the reach of history or Shakespeare. Archaeology has made a historical cypher real, and humanised a fictional monster. A distant medieval monarch has been revealed as one of us. Mike Pitts is the author of Digging for Richard III: How Archaeology Found the King (Thames and Hudson, 2014) Michael Hicks:  This quest funded a massive research effort. Yet it failed  This quest generated worldwide knowledge of Richard III, of modern science and of Leicester University, funded a massive multi-disciplinary research effort and potentially taught much about Richard and his age. Yet it failed   perhaps because these bones were not Richard s*, but those of a non-Plantagenet slain between 1455 and 1530; certainly because the issue was prejudged. Researchers sought only to confirm the remains as Richard s. Suspect radiocarbon dating, discrepancies in the evidence found in the wounds and grave, and contrary Y chromosome results   all of these were brushed aside. Much remains unknown   about Richard s maternal ancestors; mortality in the Wars of the Roses; where that conflict s slain were buried; the identities of the other internees at the Leicester friary; and paternity breaks among late medieval English aristocrats. This cannot be the end of the research. * Michael Hicks queried the identification of the remains in the April 2014 issue of BBC History Magazine Michael Hicks is the former head of history at the University of Winchester Phil Stone:  Richard III will be buried with dignity and honour  After Bosworth, Richard III was taken to Leicester, exposed and then buried in the Grey Friars with much haste and little honour. It is not known where he wished to be buried   his will has not survived   but there has been much (and sometimes very passionate) debate about where his remains should go. Standard archaeological practice is to rebury remains close to where they were found, reflected in the exhumation licence upheld in the High Court. Richard III will be buried in Leicester Cathedral, very close to the Grey Friars. All of the suggested alternatives had their drawbacks. The family mausoleum at Fotheringhay is too small, and it is my understanding that the authorities would not give permission to use St George s Chapel, Windsor or Westminster Abbey. Besides, there is no room in the latter for another burial, especially that of a king. York Minster was also suggested, since Richard III had ordered the building of a chantry there   yet that does not mean that he intended it to be the location of his burial (and, in any case, burials in the minster were halted by law some 170 years ago). Despite demands to do otherwise, the Richard III Society has maintained impartiality throughout the entirety of the burial debate. Our stance was that we would work with whichever religious house was chosen in order to ensure that Richard III could be buried with dignity, solemnity and honour, giving him what he was denied in 1485. I m very pleased to say that this is what is to be done. Phil Stone is chairman of the Richard III Society Francis Pryor:  The project was a great achievement for archaeology  The archaeological excavation and the historical reconstruction were enormously successful. They provided splendid examples of close teamwork and showed why archaeology is still the best general training for life after university that any student could hope to acquire. The Richard III project combined so many useful skills: hands-on practical experience, advanced computing and surveying, but also  softer  aspects such as interpretation, communication, PR and outreach. The project showed well how modern archaeology can bridge the divide between the worlds of art and science better than any other academic subject. All in all, it was a huge achievement and a great advertisement for the expert research being carried out by institutions such as the University of Leicester. Francis Pryor is the author of Home: A Time Traveller s Tales from Britain s Prehistory (Allen Lane, 2014) Dr Turi King:  We will be able to learn even more in coming years  he identification of Richard III s remains was based on strands of evidence drawn from experts from the fields of history, archaeology, osteology, forensics, engineering, medicine, genealogy and genetics. The genetic analysis has thrown up some particularly interesting results, showing that there isn t a match with living male-line relatives. This is not particularly surprising given the known possibility of a false paternity (in other words, the biological father is not the recorded father) somewhere in the 19 links in the genealogical chain   though where the break occurred is still not known. We now know that Richard almost certainly had blue eyes and probably light-coloured hair, at least in childhood, allowing us to show which of the two earliest portraits of Richard most closely matches the genetically predicted results (the  arched-frame portrait  in the Society of Antiquaries of London). As we continue to learn more about which gene or genes may be involved in particular traits, the current whole-genome analysis will allow us to use this knowledge to learn even more about Richard in the coming years. Dr Turi King is lecturer in genetics and archaeology at the University of Leicester Chris Skidmore:  This evidence needs to be the beginning, not the final word  I will never forget the moment when I found out that Richard s remains had been unearthed beneath a Leicester car park. Sitting at my desk in the sweltering August heat back in 2012, I had nearly finished the first draft of my book on Bosworth when, with BBC News playing in the background, I caught a sight of the red  breaking news  banner flashing across the screen. Since then, there seems to have been barely a day when Richard III has been out of the news. The discovery has revealed much about the final wounds sustained by Richard during his final moments on the battlefield, in what seems nothing less than a staged execution rather than death by fighting. Scientific tests on the remains have taught us more about Richard: perhaps most importantly, we now know that Thomas More was right, and that Richard did have a curved spine, though hardly of  hunchback  proportions. Yet all of this new evidence needs to be the start, not the last word, in a reassessment of Richard s life. And to do this, the evidence will no longer be found in the ground but in the countless pages of undisturbed documentary evidence lying under our noses in the archives. Richard is finally to be laid to rest   yet the search for new evidence must continue. I m confident that the controversies surrounding one of England s most famous monarchs will remain alive for years to come.

        "content": "Speaking exclusively to History Extra, Hicks said that at one time or another, the last Plantagenet king envisaged being buried at at least five different locations. Ad Hicks, who is head of history at the University of Winchester, said:  Death was ever-present in the Middle Ages, and people prepared for it at much younger ages than they do today.  Determining what happened to their possessions was a factor, but it was more important to ensure salvation and to mitigate sufferings in purgatory after death.  Richard III died at the age of 32. He drafted wills   none of which now survive   and planned his death on several occasions. Each will would have succeeded the previous one.  Richard died a traitor, with all his possessions seized by the crown. He died intestate [as though without making a formal will]; therefore we do not know for sure where he wanted to be buried. But I believe there are a number of possible places.  The result of a judicial review over where the remains of Richard III should be buried is expected this month. The judicial review will examine the justice secretary s decision to authorise the exhumation and reinterment of the monarch s remains in Leicester. It has been brought by a group of Richard III s distant relatives, the Plantagenet Alliance Limited, who are campaigning to see the former king reburied in York. Here, Hicks explores five sites Richard may have wished to have been buried: Fotheringhay College Where? The mausoleum of the House of York, Northamptonshire Why? Richard was born at Fotheringhay, and I think the presumption must have once been that he would be buried at the family mausoleum at Fotheringhay College. It was founded by the Dukes of York, and contains memorials to many of the members of the House of York. There, in 1476, Richard presided as chief mourner at the reburial of his father, Richard Duke of York, and elder brother, Edmund Earl of Rutland, both slain by the Lancastrians in 1460 at the battle of Wakefield. [They were previously buried at Pontefract]. I think, until he had his own family and mausoleum, Fotheringhay was the most likely place Richard would have been buried. Richard also helped to endow St George s Chapel Windsor, which his eldest brother Edward IV planned to be his own mausoleum. Edward was indeed buried there. He allotted space within it to at least two trusted Yorkists, Lords Hastings and Ferrers: perhaps Richard planned to join them As king, Richard moved Henry VI there from Chertsey. Perhaps he expected to make this the new royal mausoleum. However, he later became dynastic, marrying Anne Neville and having at least one child, and his burial place of choice probably changed. It s also worth noting that the other three family burial places of Richard and his wife, Anne Neville, available to him   Warwick College, Tewkesbury Abbey and Bisham Priory   were located too far away from where Richard lived to be viable options. They did not fit in with his role as  lord of the north . Middleham parish church and Barnard Castle chapel Where? North Yorkshire and County Durham respectively Why? In 1478, Richard decided to found two collegiate churches of dean, canons and choristers, in the north: at Middleham parish church and the chapel in Barnard Castle. It was logical for Richard to establish his own mausoleum. Therefore, he gained permission in 1478 to start endowing these churches. Richard gave Middleham parish church substantial estates, and aimed to found and incorporate a college there for a dean and six secular priests. He assembled some building materials to extend the east end and add living accommodation, but had not got very far when he died. St Alkelda s Church at Middleham survives. Perhaps he meant Middleham to become the burial place for his family, but more probably he had such plans for the chapel in Barnard Castle   its foundation was to be much bigger and grander, for a dean and twelve priests. Nothing of it now remains. However, when Richard became king, both Middleham and Barnard were rendered out of date   neither were grand enough for a king. York Minster Where? York, North Yorkshire Why? As Duke of Gloucester, Richard made himself  Lord of the North . When Richard became king in 1483, he celebrated especially at York, where his son was invested as Prince of Wales. Richard founded a chantry at York Minster of 100 priests, to pray for the good of his soul and those of his family. One hundred priests was an unheard of quantity   the wages would have been about  1,000 a year, and the plan required a  25,000 capital investment. This was an enormous investment: about a third of the income of the English crown at the time. This was a bigger endowment than for any other medieval chapel. We know that some clergy were appointed and paid, and celebrated mass at existing chapels in the minster. Materials were assembled to extend the minster, and to establish living accommodation, but we know nothing of the plans that were dropped after Richard s death. Professor Barrie Dobson suggested that York Minster was to be Richard s sepulchre. This is unproven but, given the evidence, perfectly feasible. Westminster Abbey Where? Westminster, London Why? Richard s wife, Anne Neville, died at Westminster in March 1485, and was buried with all the honours due to a queen at Westminster Abbey by the door to Edward the Confessor s chapel. It could have been that Richard planned to join her there   it was common to be buried with your wife. But only four months later   in August 1485   Richard himself was dead. He therefore had no time to construct a splendid tomb for Anne, and perhaps for himself too. The problem with Westminster Abbey, however, was that there was little space   this was why Henry VII added his massive Lady Chapel at the east end. And while we might argue that Richard wanted to be buried at Westminster with his queen, there is some evidence that he tried to replace her before she died. And why might Richard not have wanted to be buried at Leicester? Leicester is home to the mausoleum of the House of Lancaster   Richard s enemy   so it s very unlikely he would have wanted to be buried there. But history happened, and he was killed in battle in Leicester. People who died in battle didn t have any say in where they ended up [being buried]. Prof Hicks last month raised doubts about whether the skeleton discovered in Leicester is in fact that of Richard III. Click here to read the article.

        "title": "Lambert Simnel: Richard III s heir who 'had a stronger claim to the throne than Henry VII'",
        "content": "Claiming to be Richard III s heir and the rightful king of England, this boy   supposedly Edward, Earl of Warwick, the son of Richard III s brother, George, Duke of Clarence   was crowned king of England in Dublin Cathedral, despite the Tudor government insisting that his real name was Lambert Simnel and that he was an imposter. Ad In 2015, the late author and historian John Ashdown-Hill questioned the generally accepted Tudor view that this boy was a mere pretender to the throne. In The Dublin King, Ashdown-Hill used previously unpublished information to uncover the true identity of the Yorkist heir, who he concludes had a stronger claim to the throne than Henry VII. He also debunked the belief by some that the so-called  Dublin King  himself claimed to be one of the  princes in the Tower . Here, Ashdown-Hill revealed the two conflicting life stories of Edward, 17th Earl of Warwick  Born: 25 February 1475, Warwick Castle Died: Officially beheaded for treason, Tower Hill, 28 November 1499   but his conflicting life story disputes this Family: The third of four children of George, Duke of Clarence and his wife, Isabel Neville. Edward s maternal grandfather was the famous  Kingmaker  Earl of Warwick. His father s brothers were the Yorkist kings, Edward IV and Richard III. Edward s eldest sibling, Anne, and his younger brother, Richard, both died soon after being born. His mother, Isabel Duchess of Clarence, also died soon after Richard s birth Famous for: Reputedly spending his teenage years as Henry VII s prisoner in the Tower of London, and suffering from a mental disability Life: Edward s father, George, believed his enemy Elizabeth Woodville (consort of his brother, Edward IV) was behind the poisoning of his wife and younger son. He became scared about the future of his surviving children   and himself. Fear for his children led to plans to smuggle Edward out of the country - and to contacts with Ireland. Fear for his own future prompted George s campaign against Elizabeth Woodville and her children. This resulted in George s imprisonment and execution. Thus, as his third birthday approached, Edward Earl of Warwick found himself orphaned. His uncle, Edward IV, sent for him. But King Edward IV had not seen his nephew and namesake for three years. Could the king have recognised the little boy who was handed over to him and then brought up as Earl of Warwick at the Tower of London? In 1483, following the death of Edward IV, Richard III was offered the crown on the grounds that Edward IV had been legally married to Eleanor Talbot, daughter of Lord Shrewsbury. Thus Edward IV s subsequent marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was bigamous and their children were illegitimate. Richard III assumed care of young Warwick (then aged eight). He housed him at Sheriff Hutton Castle near York, with other Yorkist princes and princesses, and began training Warwick for a future position of power and influence. In 1485 Richard III was killed at the battle of Bosworth. The usurper Henry VII had no real claim to the throne. To improve his weak position Henry decided to marry Elizabeth of York (eldest daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville). He revoked the act of Parliament which stated that Edward IV s real wife had been Eleanor Talbot, and then represented Elizabeth to the nation as the Yorkist heiress. But Henry VII was worried about Warwick. In 1470 King Henry VI had recognised George Duke of Clarence as the next Lancastrian heir to the throne after his own son. As Henry VI and his son had died in 1471, and George had died in 1478, by 1485 Warwick was the legitimate Lancastrian heir   a claim arguably unaffected by his father s execution at the hands of a Yorkist king. So Henry VII took charge of Warwick. First he was placed under the guardianship of Henry VII s own mother, and later he was consigned to the Tower of London. But curiously, at the same time an alternative  son of Clarence  was being entertained in Mechelen, at the palace of his putative aunt, Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy: Margaret s Edward Earl of Warwick had apparently been brought up in Ireland. Had George s plot to smuggle his son and heir abroad in 1476 therefore succeeded? Henry VII s prisoner, or Margaret of York s guest   which of the two Earls of Warwick was genuine? Margaret s  Warwick  returned to Ireland with an army and key Yorkist supporters, led by Warwick s cousin, the Earl of Lincoln. In Ireland they combined forces with the great Earl of Kildare   former friend and deputy of Warwick s father. On 24 May 1487, Margaret s  Warwick  was crowned  Edward VI, King of England  at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin. Henry VII s anxious government sent servants to inspect the new king. They hoped to prove the boy a fraud, but when the servants met  Edward VI  they were confused. Later, Henry VII s government announced that the boy crowned in Dublin was an impostor, named either  John [BLANK]  or  Lambert Simnel . But the government s accounts of the  pretender  were also confused. Fortunately for Henry VII, when  Edward VI  invaded England, he was defeated at the battle of Stoke   and possibly captured   although one account says he escaped! The young prisoner became a servant in Henry VII s kitchen under the name of  Lambert Simnel . Meanwhile, the official Earl of Warwick remained in the Tower. In 1499 he was condemned to death, to clear the path for the projected marriage of Henry VII s son, Arthur, Prince of Wales, to the Spanish princess, Catherine of Aragon. His body was buried at Bisham Priory. So which is the true story of Edward Earl of Warwick? If the remains of the young man executed by Henry VII in 1499 could be rediscovered on the site of Bisham Priory, DNA research (similar to my 2004 discovery which prompted the search for, and subsequent identification of, the remains of Richard III) could potentially be used to clarify the truth. The late John Ashdown-Hill was a freelance historian with a PhD in history. His book, The Dublin King: The True Story of Edward Earl of Warwick, Lambert Simnel and the 'Princes in the Tower' is published by The History Press.

        "title": "Mary I: a highly impressive queen cut off in her prime",
        "content": "Bloody Mary was a Catholic bigot, a half-Spanish tyrant who burned nearly 300 Protestant men, women and children in one of the most ferocious periods of persecution in Reformation Europe. At least that s how subsequent (Protestant) writers painted her. John Foxe s classic martyrology, Actes and Monuments (popularly known as the Book of Martyrs), first published in 1563, graphically depicted  the horrible and bloudy time of Queene Mary  and dominated accounts of Mary s reign for nearly 500 years. Ad In his First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, written on the eve of Mary s death, John Knox condemned Mary both as a woman ruler and a Catholic: she was a  horrible monster Jezebel  who  compelled [Englishmen] to bow their necks under the yoke of Satan . Traditionally viewed through the prism of her religion, Mary s five-year reign has been described as disastrous, unimaginative and ineffective, with no positive achievements. Yet Mary Tudor was England s first acknowledged queen regnant: the first woman to wear the crown of England. It was a situation that her father, Henry VIII, had gone to great and infamous lengths to avert. But Mary more than met the challenge. In unprecedented circumstances she proved courageous and politically accomplished. Her reign redefined the contours of the English monarchy and proved that queens could rule as kings. For much of her life Mary had struggled to defend her right to the throne   and even to preserve her life. After the breakdown of the marriage between her mother, Catherine of Aragon, and Henry VIII she was demoted from royal princess to bastard. She was, for a time, written out of the succession by her father and, though reinstated by the 1544 Third Act of Succession and by Henry s will, she remained illegitimate. When her nine-year-old brother Edward VI inherited the throne in 1547 and confronted Mary s Catholicism, she declared that she would rather  lay her head on a block  than forsake her faith. Her supporters urged her to flee abroad, but Mary remained in England, determined to defend her claim to the crown. Battle for the crown Following her brother s death in July 1553, Mary   against all odds   won the throne in an extraordinary coup d tat. Edward had written Mary out of the succession and instead named the Protestant Lady Jane Grey as heir to the throne. Before the king s death was made public, John Dudley, the Duke of Northumberland, had secured control of the Tower and had the royal artillery and coffers at his disposal. With London apparently secure, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen. When Mary received a tip-off that Edward s death was imminent and Northumberland planned to capture her, she fled across East Anglia. One of her supporters described this as an act of  Herculean rather than of womanly daring . At Framlingham Castle in Suffolk, Mary raised her standard and rallied the local gentry and commons to her cause. On 19 July she was proclaimed queen, and her accession was greeted joyously. The scale of her achievement is often overlooked. Mary had led the only successful revolt against central government in 16th-century England. She had eluded capture, mobilised a counter-coup and, in the moment of crisis, proved courageous, decisive and politically adept. By playing down her Catholicism and proclaiming her legitimacy, Mary secured both Catholic and Protestant support. She also ensured that the crown continued along the legal line of Tudor succession, in doing so, defending Elizabeth s position as her heir (though this wasn t made official until the final weeks of her life). Having secured the throne, Mary then had to establish herself as a female monarch. It was an unprecedented position in a deeply patriarchal society   indeed, many questioned whether a woman could wear the crown. The monarch was understood to be God s representative on Earth, a figure of defence and justice   a role premised on military might. The language, image and expectations of English monarchy and royal majesty were unequivocally male, and the rights of a queen regnant were a matter of great uncertainty. Mary s accession had changed the rules of the game, and the nature of this new feminised politics was yet to be defined, yet in many respects Mary proved more than equal to the task. Decisions over the details of the practice and power of a queen regnant became precedents for the future. In April 1554 Mary s parliament passed the Act for Regal Power, which enshrined in law that queens held power as  fully, wholly and absolutely  as their male predecessors, thereby establishing the gender-free authority of the crown. Mary s coronation saw her accepting the full regalia of a male monarch and assuming the sacral role that had hitherto been confined to kings. Previously, it had been precisely the exercise of this semi-priestly power, derived from the coronation, that   it was argued   precluded women from acceding to the throne. By continuing practices undertaken by previous kings   providing the healing touch for the  king s evil  (scrofula) and blessing rings believed to cure cramp and epilepsy   Mary showed that the office of crowned monarch was not limited by gender. Mary had stated a preference for remaining single but accepted the need to marry to fulfil her public duty to her faith and her kingdom. Everyone agreed on the need for a husband who could guide her in ruling, and produce a male heir, thereby securing the succession. Though it has traditionally been argued that Mary s marriage to Philip of Spain was unpopular, an alliance with Habsburg Spain was politically expedient. Certainly, the marriage treaty was as  favourable as possible for the interest and security and even the grandeur of England , with Mary s legal rights as queen preserved and Spanish influence kept to a minimum For some, though, this was not enough. In January 1554 Mary faced a Protestant rebellion led by Thomas Wyatt that aimed to prevent the match, but once again the queen rose to the occasion. Despite the urging of her councillors she refused to leave London; then, in a remarkable speech at the Guildhall, she attacked Wyatt as a wicked traitor, defended her religion and choice of husband, and called on Londoners to stand firm in support. Mary stressed her defiance, courage and commitment not by claiming to have the qualities of a man but, rather, to have these qualities as a woman. Mary s rousing rhetoric so mobilised the people of London that when Thomas Wyatt approached the Tower he found Ludgate barred against him. The rebels were compelled to lay down their arms and sue for mercy. Mary was manifestly an effective public speaker well before her sister Elizabeth garnered the plaudits. Mary s reputation has been almost entirely defined by religion and summed up by the infamous epithet  Bloody Mary . Elizabethan Protestants, who were the first to write the history of Mary s reign, characterised the regime as violently repressive, spiritually moribund and resoundingly unsuccessful. Yet in many ways Mary s programme to convert hearts and minds to Roman Catholicism was innovative and energetic. Led by Cardinal Reginald Pole, the programme of recatholicisation encouraged preaching and used the printing press to produce homilies and catechisms, and to foster a parochial revival of Catholicism. Even the burnings   the accepted punishment for heresy at the time   were, it has been argued, broadly effective. Laymen were fully and enthusiastically involved in the work of detecting heretics, and by 1558 the numbers being burned were falling. The Marian church was proving successful in its mission   but then Mary died prematurely, after just five years of rule and with no Catholic heir. Forgotten victory Traditional assessments of Mary s queenship have focused heavily on the apparent military failures of her reign, as epitomised by the loss of Calais in the Anglo-French war of 1557 59. Such a failure contrasts with Elizabeth s victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588. While Elizabeth I is popularly remembered as a triumphant warrior queen, Mary is pilloried as achieving only national military humiliation. Certainly, the loss of Calais has cast a long shadow over Mary s reputation. Yet assessments of Mary s military prowess should be rethought. Before the loss of Calais, she experienced successes. In August 1557, English and Spanish forces captured St-Quentin, an action in which some 3,000 French troops were killed and 7,000 captured, including their commander Anne de Montmorency, the constable of France. The news was greeted in England with widespread celebrations. London chroniclers heralded the success of  the king, our master    Mary s husband was now accepted. The political community was motivated for the national war effort in King Philip s service. But, weeks later, the English experienced the humiliating defeat that would stamp a decisive imprint on Mary s reign. As the last remnant of the English claim to France, Calais had a symbolic value that was out of proportion to its economic and military importance. Despite the brevity of her reign, Mary extended royal authority in the localities, managed her parliament, rebuilt the navy, reorganised the militia and laid the foundations for reform of the coinage and the restructuring of the economy. New markets for exports were developed in Guinea, the Baltic and Russia, with the latter resulting in the formation of the Muscovy Company in 1558. The government s overhaul of the book of rates in the same year also increased the crown s revenues from customs. Statutes were passed that regulated the proper manufacture of particular wares and provided for more efficient and systematic production measures. Five hospitals were re-endowed by Mary, including the Savoy Hospital in London. Mary proved to be a conscientious and hardworking queen who was determined to be closely involved in government business and policymaking. She would, as the Venetian ambassador recorded, rise  at daybreak when, after saying her prayers and hearing mass in private , she would  transact business incessantly until after midnight . Mary ruled with the full measure of royal majesty and achieved much of what she set out to do. She won her rightful throne, married her Spanish prince and returned the country to Roman Catholicism. The Spanish marriage was a match with the most powerful ruling house in Europe, and the highly favourable marriage treaty ultimately won the support of the English government. She had defeated rebels and preserved the Tudor monarchy. Her Catholicism was influenced by her humanist education and showed many signs of broad acceptance before she died. She was an intelligent, politically adept and resolute monarch   very much her own woman. Redefining the monarchy Once seen as weak willed and lacking in leadership qualities, Mary is now heralded as courageous and warlike, educated for rule and politically determined. Her early death   in the midst of disastrous harvest failures and a flu epidemic, and soon after the loss of Calais   ensured Mary s reputation was fatally sealed. If she had lived longer, her initiatives in religion and finance would have come to fruition; if she had borne a child, a Catholic future for England would have been assured. Nevertheless, by securing the throne, Mary ensured that the crown continued along the legal line of Tudor succession. As the first queen regnant of England she redefined royal ritual and law, thereby establishing that a female ruler, married or unmarried, would enjoy identical power and authority to male monarchs. Mary was the Tudor trailblazer, a political pioneer whose reign redefined the English monarchy. Her successor had the advantage of being the second woman to rule. Though she would never acknowledge it, Elizabeth built on the foundations laid by her sister, and received from her an invaluable political education. After Mary s death, the coronation robes of England s first queen were hastily refurbished   with a new bodice and sleeves   to fit its second. This outfit was just one of many things Elizabeth borrowed from her predecessor.

        "title": "Joan of Kent: a perfect princess?",
        "content": "The marriage of Edward, Prince of Wales, on 10 October 1361 in the chapel at Windsor was reported by all the contemporary chroniclers, as befitted his importance as heir to the throne. The prince was 31, tall and handsome, the hero of Cr cy and Poitiers; he was a gifted, successful and popular soldier and commander. Posthumously known as the Black Prince, his biographer, the Chandos Herald, tells us that Edward was renowned throughout Europe as the epitome of a chivalric knight. Ad His bride, described by Jean Froissart as  the most beautiful woman in all the realm of England , wore a red dress with cloth of gold decorated with birds. Joan, Duchess of Cornwall, Countess of Chester and Countess of Kent, was the first member of the English royal family to bear the title Princess of Wales. The service was conducted by the archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Islip, in the presence of the prince s parents   Edward III and Queen Philippa, the rest of the royal family and the most important members of the clergy and nobility. The prince was deeply in love; in 1367 he addressed his wife as  my dearest and truest sweetheart and well beloved companion . The marriage was very successful, the couple were happy and their union blessed with two sons, Prince Edward (born 1365) and Prince Richard (the future Richard II, born 1367). Yet, despite the prince s love for his bride, she was in many ways a surprising choice, and, it has been argued, an unsuitable one. Heirs to the throne were expected to make a match that would bring political and diplomatic advantages to the crown. With these objectives in mind, the prince s father (Edward III), grandfather (Edward II), and great-grandfather (Edward I) had all married foreign princesses. Arguably, there was an even greater need for Prince Edward to do likewise. In 1340 Edward III had made a claim to the French throne, starting the lengthy conflict with France known as the Hundred Years  War. The stunning military successes culminating in the capture of the French king at Poitiers in 1356 had brought a cessation of hostilities. The ensuing treaty of Br tigny in 1360 granted the English crown much of the disputed lands in France. Edward III had needed allies to help achieve these results, and would need them again to help him keep the fruits of the treaty. A royal marriage was an obvious and usual way to cement an important alliance. Indeed, several foreign matches had been proposed for the prince over the years, but none had come to fruition. Either the proposed alliance had lost its attraction for the king, or it was thwarted by the requirement for a papal dispensation, which the pope, favouring France, refused to give. At 31, the prince was unmarried and free to marry the woman of his choice. His sweetheart (whom he called Jeanette) was his cousin Joan, the daughter of Edmund, Earl of Kent. Marriage to Joan would not bring any political or diplomatic advantage, nor would it enhance the prestige of the English crown in any way. In addition, Joan was a widow with four children. Image of Joan of Kent dating from around 1380. (Hulton Archive/Getty Images) However, Joan was not ineligible. She had royal blood; her father was Edward I s youngest son. She was also extremely wealthy, having inherited her father s estates. Although the king needed allies for his war against France, financial security for his sons evidently outweighed the alternative advantages of foreign alliances. With their father s blessing, three of Prince Edward s younger brothers had all married wealthy noblewomen. Following the treaty of Br tigny, Edward III planned that his heir would take over the lands held in France as the newly created principality of Aquitaine, and rule in his name without financial help from the English crown. Locally raised taxes could not be guaranteed to cover the costs. The prince s resources would be stretched, making Joan s wealth a significant attraction. But if eligible by virtue of her birth and wealth, Joan s marital history was a cause of concern. In 1340, aged 12 and under the guardianship of the king and queen, Joan had secretly married Thomas Holand, a humble household knight. A year later Joan s widowed mother and uncle arranged her marriage to William Montague, heir to the Earl of Salisbury, a close friend of the king. A reluctant Joan was forced into a bigamous marriage. For the next eight years Holand and Montague contested their respective rights to Joan. In November 1349 the pope pronounced in favour of Thomas Holand, the deciding factor being Joan s evidence supporting him. Thomas Holand became one of Edward III s most trusted commanders in France, and was created Earl of Kent shortly before he died after a short illness in December 1360. His marriage to Joan was a success, with four children born over 10 years, and Joan was almost the only noblewoman of her generation to accompany her husband as he fulfilled his military duties in France. But their secret marriage and the wrangle over Joan s marital status had a lasting effect on her reputation. In 1399, 14 years after her death, the chronicler Adam of Usk described Joan as a mother  given to slippery ways   to say nothing of many other things I have heard . With this marital history, Joan could hardly be regarded as an ideal choice for the heir to the throne. Especially as in 1361 William Montague was still very much alive (albeit married to someone else). Jean Froissart suggested that the marriage did not have royal approval, and even the archbishop of Canterbury expressed his reservations to the prince. However, far from disapproving of the match, Edward III went to extraordinary lengths to secure his heir s marriage. The king and his son were well aware that Joan s marital history could cause problems, particularly for the succession. Avoidance of this depended on ensuring the legal validity of the royal marriage. A papal dispensation was required. After the prince initially petitioned the pope without success, the king effectively blackmailed him by claiming that the prince was already secretly married to Joan. Rather than offend the English crown by refusing, Innocent VI agreed to the request. He issued a comprehensive bull that reaffirmed the validity of the original Holand marriage, provided dispensation for the prince s marriage, and confirmed the legitimacy of any offspring of the royal marriage. Mindful that a new pope might overturn his predecessor s decision, a further confirmatory dispensation was obtained from Innocent VI s successor, Urban V. In gratitude the prince donated rather more to the church than the papal dispensation required, endowing Canterbury Cathedral handsomely. With such effort expended on legitimising the marriage, what was expected of the new Princess of Wales? Joan would of course be expected to provide the prince with an heir, but in addition, how she behaved and was regarded by her peers would be crucial. Any stigma that attached to her would reflect on her husband, and on the crown. Worse, it might instigate a challenge to the royal marriage that the king had gone to such lengths to validate. Joan more than justified the efforts made to ensure she was the prince s legal spouse. Her behaviour as Princess of Wales was exemplary. After their marriage the prince set up court in Aquitaine, with Joan at his side. Contemporary accounts describe Joan as a loving and faithful wife and within six years she had given birth to two sons. In 1367 the prince fought his last major campaign in Spain, leaving his wife to preside over their court. Although victorious at the battle of N jera, the prince returned with a serious illness from which he never recovered. After the tragic early death of their eldest son, Prince Edward, the couple returned to England in 1371. The prince s poor health forced him to rely on his wife to represent him, and her role became more public. Joan resolutely kept out of politics but built up close and harmonious relationships with the prince s family, especially her powerful brother-in-law John of Gaunt, and with many of the most powerful nobles. Despite their marital debacle, William Montague remained a close friend. As it became clear that the prince was unlikely to survive his father, with Edward III also in failing health, the likelihood was that Joan s son Richard would succeed as a minor. The prince died in 1376, when Richard was nine. Joan s devotion to the prince and her discreet conduct as his wife had won her respect and trust, and there was no suggestion that Richard should be removed from her care. Joan s son, King Richard II. Portrait by an unknown artist, 1390. (DeAgostini/Getty Images) Prince Richard, aged 10, succeeded his grandfather as king in July 1377. Only twice before had a minor succeeded to the throne. Joan was the highest ranked woman at court, and with the king in her charge was in a position of considerable power and influence. Her reputation, and her cordial relationship with Richard s uncles, especially John of Gaunt, had helped ensure a smooth succession. Joan continued to be circumspect in her behaviour; she made no attempt to use her authority to direct events or to take a prominent role, nor did she take advantage of her position to benefit herself or anyone closely connected to her, even her two Holand sons. Supporting and protecting Richard became her priority; she ensured that his household was made up of his father s loyal retainers and she fostered family unity between Richard, his uncles, and her Holand children. Difficulties for Richard, in particular with John of Gaunt, were resolved by Joan s skilful advocacy and mediatory skills. In 1381 Richard s personal safety was seriously threatened in the violent unrest known as the Peasants  Revolt. In London, he became trapped in the Tower. Joan was in Canterbury, on her annual pilgrimage to the Black Prince s tomb. As soon as she heard of the disturbances in London, she made her way back to join Richard. Her popularity saved her from harm when she was accosted twice by groups of rebels. She made no attempt to intervene personally, simply providing Richard with the support of her presence. Richard s effective handling of the crisis showed Joan that he no longer needed her to protect him. After arranging his marriage to Anne of Bohemia in 1382 she quietly retired from court to Wallingford Castle. Yet, when she heard of the serious row between Richard and his half-brother John Holand in July 1385, Joan immediately attempted to intervene. Her death in August 1385 was attributed by the chronicler Walsingham to her broken heart at failing to reconcile the two. The Black Prince's tomb in Canterbury Cathedral, to which Joan made an annual pilgrimage. (RDImages/Epics/Getty) Joan was Princess of Wales for 24 years, and one of the most important and influential women of her age. If her reputation was dubious when she married the prince, it was almost beyond reproach when she died, loved and respected, mourned by many outside her immediate family and friends. Joan s personality was a substantial contributory factor to her success as Princess of Wales. As a child she had shown independence and courage in choosing to marry and stay with Thomas Holand. As an adult she showed that she was gentle, warm and loving   a natural peacemaker with an innate ability to get on well with people. The Chandos Herald summed up her contemporary reputation with his description of her as beautiful, pleasant and wise. His description has proved remarkably enduring, and it is by her posthumously bestowed sobriquet of the  Fair Maid of Kent  that Joan is best known. As Princess of Wales, Joan set a standard of behaviour for others to admire and emulate. She was, in many ways, the perfect princess.

        "content": "Ad 1703: Building begins at Buckingham Palace The palace was originally built in 1703 as Buckingham House, a London home for the 3rd Earl of Mulgrave, John Sheffield. It became a royal residence when King George III purchased it in 1761 as a comfortable family home for his wife, Queen Charlotte. Fourteen of George and Charlotte s 15 children were born there. Buckingham House underwent a palatial transformation in the 1820s, when King George IV employed architect John Nash to give it a royal renovation. Queen Victoria was the first monarch to adopt Buckingham Palace as her official residence, moving there in 1837, within a year of becoming queen. She oversaw the last major construction work at the palace, adding the front wing in the 1840s to give her large family extra space. In 1883 electricity was installed in the ballroom, the largest room in the palace. Over the following four years electricity was installed throughout the palace, which now uses more than 40,000 lightbulbs. Buckingham House, 1746. Built in 1703, the house forms the architectural core of the present-day Buckingham Palace.

Queen Victoria made the first recorded royal appearance on the balcony in 1851, when she greeted the public during celebrations for the opening of the Great Exhibition, a groundbreaking showcase of international manufacturing, masterminded by Prince Albert. Appearances on the balcony are now a popular part of royal events. In 2002 Queen Elizabeth II waved to crowds from the balcony as more than a million people flocked to Buckingham Palace to celebrate her Golden Jubilee. More than 200 million viewers around the world watched the evening s  Party at the Palace  concert on television. At their wedding in 2011, Prince William and Kate Middleton also appeared on the famous balcony. The newlyweds shared a kiss, much to the delight of the crowds.

Following the wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on 10 February 1840, their second child [and eldest son], Edward was born at the palace on 9 November 1841. Known to his family as  Bertie , Edward spent much of his childhood at the palace with his eight siblings. In 1902 Edward underwent major surgery at Buckingham Palace. Close to death from appendicitis, he was successfully operated on in a room overlooking the garden. Later that year [following his recovery] he was crowned at Westminster Abbey after nearly 60 years as heir to the throne. After years of excessive cigar and cigarette consumption, in 1910 Edward contracted a severe case of bronchitis. He died at Buckingham Palace on 6 May 1910 following a series of heart attacks, and was succeeded by his son King George V. Following a royal birth or death, a notice was attached to the railings of Buckingham Palace to alert members of the public. Even today, this traditional custom is upheld.

Led by Emmeline Pankhurst, the women began processing towards the palace from Grosvenor Gardens, declaring their intention to deliver a petition to the king. The protest attracted sensationalist and unsympathetic press coverage. The Daily Mirror carried the headline  Mrs Pankhurst arrested at the gates of Buckingham Palace in trying to present a petition to the King , surrounded by photographs of clashes between the protestors and police. It described  distressing scenes  in which a  body of militant suffragettes  led by Pankhurst  endeavoured to carry out their impossible scheme , evading police and making it to the gates of the palace. The Telegraph, meanwhile, described a  serious fracas between the wild women and the police, in which the militants delivered a brief but furious attack on the constables . When she reached the palace gates, Emmeline Pankhurst was arrested. The Telegraph suggested she  was able to offer little or no resistance, but shouting out that she had got to the palace gates, she was carried bodily by a chief inspector to a private motor which the police had in waiting . Following her arrest, Pankhurst was taken to Holloway Prison. Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst is arrested outside Buckingham Palace in May 1914.

Her younger sister Princess Margaret, who was seven years old, also signed up as a Brownie. The Girl Guide Association had been formed in 1910 by Agnes Baden Powell, as an alternative girl s organisation to scouting. As it was believed that the princesses should live as normal lives as possible, they were enrolled to join the popular organisation by their aunt, Princess Mary. The 1st Buckingham Palace Company was then formed, which included some 20 Guides and 14 Brownies, made up of children of royal household members and Buckingham Palace employees. A summerhouse in the palace garden became the Guides  headquarters, with the princesses reportedly cooking on campfires, pitching tents and earning badges like any other Guides. Following the outbreak of the Second World War the summerhouse headquarters was closed down due to the bomb threat and moved to the more rural setting of Windsor Castle. In 1952 Queen Elizabeth and her mother became joint patrons of the Girl Guides. Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II, right) and her younger sister Princess Margaret dressed as guides in 1943.

(Photo by Topical Press Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) 1940s: The palace is bombed The royal family remained at Buckingham Palace throughout the Second World War, despite Foreign Office advice to leave Britain. Queen Elizabeth [later the Queen Mother] declared:  The children will not leave unless I do. I shall not leave unless their father does, and the king will not leave the country in any circumstances, whatever . However, the decision to remain in Britain placed the royal family in significant danger   the palace received nine direct bomb hits during the course of the war and on 8 March 1941 PC Steve Robertson, a policeman on duty at the Palace, was killed by flying debris when a bomb hit. In a letter to her mother-in-law, Queen Mary, the queen recalled one particularly difficult night of bombing at the palace in 1940, when the palace chapel was destroyed. In it she recounts how she was  battling  to remove an eyelash from the king's eye when they heard the  unmistakable whirr-whirr of a German plane  and then the  scream of a bomb . She recalled how  it all happened so quickly that we had only time to look foolishly at each other when the scream hurtled past us and exploded with a tremendous crash in the quadrangle . Despite the palace bombings, the royal family remained defiant.  I am glad we have been bombed , Queen Elizabeth declared in September 1940,  Now we can look the East End in the eye .

Winston Churchill appeared with the king, queen and the two royal princesses on the palace s balcony before huge crowds. Throughout the course of the day the royal family made a total of eight appearances on the balcony to wave to those celebrating below. During their father s final balcony appearance of the day the princesses Margaret and Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) secretly joined the cheering crowd below. Elizabeth later recalled:  We stood outside and shouted,  We want the king  I think it was one of the most memorable nights of my life . Ad King George VI also delivered a radio address to his nation, played on loud speakers in Trafalgar Square. He praised Britons  resilience and honoured those who had lost their lives.  Let us remember those who will not come back  he declared,  let us remember the men in all the services, and the women in all the services, who have laid down their lives. We have come to the end of our tribulation and they are not with us at the moment of our rejoicing .",

        "title": "Not such a prude after all: the secrets of Henry VIII s love life",
        "content": "When it comes to Henry VIII s love life, the biographical focus usually falls on Henry s wives and is dominated by his quest for a son. This is no surprise given its dynastic importance and the comparative paucity of material surviving on Henry s mistresses. Indeed, Henry is often compared to his lusty and syphilitic contemporary, Francis I of France, whose antics leave the English king in the shade. Henry certainly had no official mistress in the French style, although he did offer this title to Anne Boleyn, who refused it. There is also the question of Henry s health, as when considering his personal life images of his obesity and injuries can easily eclipse those of his handsome youth. It may be, though, that tradition has him all wrong. Ad Henry wasn t so much a prude as a very private man. While Francis paraded his mistresses in public, Henry preferred to keep his extramarital liaisons known only to a small circle of loyal intimates: his chief minister, his gentlemen of the chamber and his closest friends, many of whom went to the block for treason in the 1530s, contributing to the silence over the king s private affairs. Henry valued secrecy and discretion when it came to his personal relationships and although he was at the centre of a busy court, he had the means to achieve this. Henry s success in this regard becomes clearer when we consider the two mistresses that are known to have shared his bed, and the processes of history by which they were recorded. Elizabeth (or  Bessie ) Blount s name is remembered today because she was an unmarried mother who bore a surviving son, which the king chose to acknowledge. Usually kings favoured affairs with married women, whose pregnancies could be officially attributed to their husbands, even if the court gossips suspected otherwise. Bessie was quickly married off and her subsequent children, born soon after her son Henry FitzRoy, were given the surname of her pliant husband. Had Bessie s marriage taken place sooner, or her child been female or not survived, we would not know about her relations with Henry VIII. Likewise, our information about Henry s affair with Mary Boleyn derives from Henry s reluctant admission of affinity when he desired to marry her younger sister, Anne. Without these chance survivals, these accidents of history, the image we have of Henry today would be as a shining example of marital fidelity, and we know that was not the case. There is also a wealth of circumstantial evidence to suggest that Henry had a number of affairs or casual encounters. These are more than mere court rumours: cumulatively they offer a convincing picture. In 1513, when Henry stayed in Lille before the siege of Tournai, he stayed up all night dancing with a mysterious  Madame the Bastard,  barefoot and in his shirtsleeves. After returning to England, he received a letter from a maid of honour by the name of Etiennette de la Baume, in the Lille household of Margaret of Savoy. She asked for his assistance for her forthcoming marriage, reminding Henry of a promise he had made her  when we parted  and that he had called her his page. Another letter, dating from 1514, implicated the king in a flirtation being enjoyed by his friend Charles Brandon with two ladies of the English court, to whom Brandon had sent  tokens ; during his friend s absence abroad, Henry was to act as go-between and pass on his warm words. There was also Jane Popincourt, a maid of Henry s sister Mary, who was refused entry to France in 1514 by King Louis XII on account of her immorality. This, coupled with Henry s choice of her as a dance partner the following spring and his generous gift of  100 to allow her to leave, have led to speculation that Jane had shared his bed. Perhaps most interesting of all is the entry in the Privy Papers for 1537, when a William Webbe claimed Henry had stolen away his mistress and enjoyed her favours in  avowtry  (aka advowtry)   that is, adultery. The names of various other women have been proposed as mistresses of Henry, or as the mothers of his reputed illegitimate children Thomas Stukley, John Perrot and Ethelreda Malte, but these were never acknowledged by Henry and there is no evidence to connect him with them.

(The Print Collector/Getty Images) While the church advocated regular but moderate sex within marriage   for mutual comfort and procreation   Tudor medicine stated the importance of sex for health. Without it, fluids and vapours were thought to build up in the body and cause fits, fever and illness. Aristocratic wives were expected to be models of chastity in order to produce heirs but their husbands might seek sexual satisfaction elsewhere, typically with women of the lower classes. Couples were supposed to refrain from sleeping together during part, if not all, of the wife s pregnancies, and it was during Catherine of Aragon s first confinement that Henry s court was rocked by a scandal that implicated him with one of his wife s waiting women, Anne Hastings. Hastings may have been involved with both Henry and his closest friend, William Compton, with whom she certainly had an affair in later years. The Spanish ambassador Luis Caroz believed it was the king who had turned the newlywed s head, writing in 1510 that Anne was  much liked by the king, who went after her . Anne s sister was concerned enough about her behaviour to interfere, which resulted in her banishment from court for  tale-bearing  and  insidiously spying out every unwatched moment . This was what brought the matter to Catherine s attention, and the royal couple had their first serious argument as a result. Despite living at the heart of a busy court, Henry did not lack opportunities for romance. He drew on the discretion of friends such as William Compton, whose house in Thames Street provided a convenient location for liaisons, accessible by barge, and Thomas Wolsey, who oversaw the arrangements for Bessie Blount s lying-in, acted as godfather to her son. Although there might be prying eyes at court, when Henry visited the homes of his friends in the town or country, or stopped at a hunting lodge with a small retinue, leaving his wife at court, there was a greater degree of privacy to facilitate meeting women. Wherever he travelled, Henry took his own personal lock to guarantee secrecy. And yet, even under the scrutiny of his courtiers, Henry found the perfect vehicle for flirtation. His love of masques and dancing gave him a degree of licence for intimacy; under the guise of planning entertainments, he might  borrow  maids of honour in order to rehearse elaborate pageants that required dancing, costumes and song. Writers Juan Luis Vives in the 1520s and John Heywood in the 1530s both drew the connection between dancing and sex, with the lines of contemporary plays full of bawdy and suggestive lyrics. Characters in Heywood s 1533 The Play of the Weather joke about  meddling  with each other, about literal and metaphoric dirty linen, dallying  with your simper de cocker  and kissing a woman s behind. The arrangements of Henry s household would have facilitated affairs too. The Eltham Ordinances, published in January 1526, help us understand how. When it came to sleeping with his wife, the king followed a ritual involving a large amount of staff, including an elaborate procession through the corridors that needed to be cleared and guarded, followed by a ceremony of disrobing. This visible display provided a foil for the occasions when Henry desired privacy, at night amid the chambers  reserved secret, at the pleasure of his grace, without [the] repair of any great multitude . Henry s grooms were charged to remain  humble, reverent, secret and lowly  about all tasks, with two sleeping on pallets outside his door and Sir Henry Norris charged with preventing all other gentlemen from entering. With Norris s assistance, it would not have been difficult for Henry to admit whomever he pleased. Whatever secrets he may have known, Norris took to the grave a decade later, when he became one of the scapegoats in Anne Boleyn s fall. When it comes to Henry s relationship with Anne, a further mystery arises. Traditionally, the story has been told that it was Anne s refusal that maintained Henry s interest, and that for the seven years before their secret marriage Anne kept herself aloof, denying Henry consummation. Catherine had gone through the menopause in around 1525 and Anne did not conceive until the end of 1532: Catherine s menopause coincided with Henry s thirties, at a time when he was keen to father a son. Is it really realistic that the king was celibate throughout this time? And if not, who exactly was he sleeping with? Did he continue to share a bed with Catherine, intermittently, up to the day in July 1531 when Henry rode away from her at Windsor and she was never to see him again? Perhaps Anne permitted Henry some liberties with her person after she had agreed to his proposal in around 1527. In one letter Henry refers to kissing her breasts or  pretty duckies,  and they may have enjoyed a certain degree of intimacy, stopping short of full penetration. The fact that Anne did not fall pregnant until December 1532 suggests they were restrained, or else practised some form of contraception. Early condoms were available, known as the  Venus Glove  and manufactured by glovers. They were expensive, but Henry could have afforded them. Yet Anne s allure lay in her promise and her desire not to be discarded as her sister had been. Nor did Henry wish to risk the arrival of a child before he was in a position to be able to marry her. It is far more in keeping with the mores of the time that Henry resorted to the occasional casual encounter, discreetly arranged by his gentlemen, and considered to be an essential bodily function, just as eating or sleeping. The needs of the king s body must be met. A depiction of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn s first meeting, from 1835. (Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) In later years, Henry s ulcerous leg and increasing girth rendered him less able to play the nimble lover. Yet this really only applies to the final decade of his life. The young Henry was accustomed to having his own way and with the facilities and staff to ensure his own pleasure. The notion of a prudish, restrained king may be more the result of a paucity of evidence rather than a true reflection of Henry s character. Although he was not quite, as Francis I was described,  of such slight morals that he slips readily into the gardens of other and drinks from the water of many fountains , the surviving shreds of evidence suggest Henry VIII enjoyed a full and active love life. This also provides an important reflection upon the nature of evidence and its survival. As late as 1817, when John Lingard cited the letter in which Henry admitted to having slept with Mary Boleyn, his fellow rejected the claims as a deliberate slur upon the reputation of her sister, Anne. When it comes to the sexual secrets of such a secretive Tudor monarch, it is imperative to consider the holes in the evidence as much as the evidence itself. Here was a man who married five out of his six wives in private, in a departure from the example set by his parents. Henry didn t want the details of his love life to be made public: five centuries later, he has largely succeeded.

        "title": "5 festive facts from BBC Two s QI",
        "content": "Featuring 180 questions   both new and previously included in the BBC television programme's popular 'General Ignorance' round   the book explores historical topics from the Vikings to the Vietnam War. Ad Here we bring you five festive facts taken from the book  1) Prince Albert didn t bring the first Christmas tree to Britain The first Christmas tree in England went up in December 1800, when Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, gave a children s party. One of the grown-up guests remarked,  After the company had walked round and admired the tree, each child obtained a portion of the sweets it bore, together with a toy, and then all returned home quite delighted.  Christmas trees soon became wildly fashionable in high society, but it took 40 years (helped by the popular press) for them to catch on across the country. By then Queen Victoria s husband, Prince Albert, was busy importing them, which is why they are so often associated with him. The royal Christmas tree is admired by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and their children, in this December 1848 illustration. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Prince Albert and Queen Charlotte were both born in Germany, where families had been bringing evergreen trees indoors and putting candles on them since the sixteenth century. According to legend, the first person to do this was Martin Luther (1483 1546), better known for his role in the Protestant Reformation. One evening, it s said, he looked up at the night sky, saw the stars twinkling between a tree s branches, and decided to recreate the effect in his home. Luther was a controversial figure. He was also said to eat a spoonful of his own faeces every day. The Christmas tree story may be romantic fiction, but the German tradition of decorating trees indoors did begin in Luther s lifetime. Artificial Christmas trees became popular in Britain after the death of Queen Victoria, when large ostentatious trees suddenly seemed inappropriate. The first ones were made from goose feathers that were dyed green. These were also imported from Germany, where they had become fashionable as a way of conserving the country s fir tree population. But artificial Christmas trees only took off in the 1930s with mass production by the Addis Brush Company. Founded by William Addis, inventor of the toothbrush, they used the same machinery to make bristly branches that they used to make toilet brushes. Today artificial Christmas trees are seen as an environmentally conscious alternative to the real thing. Unfortunately, an independent study released in 2009 showed that, to be greener than buying a fresh-cut tree each year, you would have to reuse your plastic tree for more than 20 years. 2)  Jingle Bells  wasn t originally written as a Christmas song  Jingle Bells  is the only Christmas song that doesn t mention Christmas, Jesus or the Nativity. That s because it was written to celebrate Thanksgiving. Originally entitled  The One-Horse Open Sleigh ,  Jingle Bells  was the work of American composer James Lord Pierpont (1822 93), uncle of the financier J. P. Morgan. Pierpont s father commissioned it for a Thanksgiving service. Pierpont led a wild life   at 14 he ran away to sea and joined a whaling ship. At 27 he left his wife and children in Boston to join the California gold rush. After re-inventing himself as a photographer, he lost all his possessions in a fire and moved to Savannah, Georgia, where he joined the Confederate army during the Civil War. Throughout this period he continued to write songs, ballads and dance tunes, including Confederate battle hymns and  minstrel  songs for performance by white people with blacked-up faces. Some of his less festive tunes include  We Conquer or Die  and  Strike for the South . The states of Massachusetts and Georgia both claim Pierpont was there when he wrote  Jingle Bells  in 1857. Wherever he was, he made very little money out of it and never lived to see his song s enormous popularity.  Jingle Bells  was the first tune played live in space. On 16 December 1965, as US astronauts Wally Schirra and Tom Stafford were preparing to re-enter the Earth s atmosphere in Gemini VI, Stafford contacted Mission Control to report a UFO.  We have an object, looks like a satellite going from north to south, probably in polar orbit . . . Looks like he might be going to re-enter soon . . . I see a command module and eight smaller modules in front. The pilot of the command module is wearing a red suit.  Before Houston could respond, Schirra began playing  Jingle Bells  on a harmonica he d smuggled aboard in his spacesuit. He was accompanied by Stafford on sleigh bells.  Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer  started life as a colouring book devised by US advertising copywriter Robert May in 1939. His reindeer was originally called  Reginald  but he changed his mind at the last minute and the book sold 2 million copies in its first Christmas alone. The song was written a decade later by May s brother-in-law Johnny Marks, who also wrote  Rockin  Around the Christmas Tree . Marks was Jewish, joining a tradition of Jewish songwriters behind classic Christmas songs, including  White Christmas  (Irving Berlin),  Let It Snow  (Sammy Cahn) and  Santa Baby  (Joan Javits).

(Photo by Transcendental Graphics/Getty Images) The story of  Winter Wonderland  (1934) is a sad one. The lyrics were inspired by watching children playing in the snow outside the sanatorium where songwriter Dick Smith was dying of tuberculosis. 3) Jesus  mum didn t call him Jesus For a start, when Jesus lived in Galilee, the letter  J  didn t exist. In Hebrew, his name was Yeshua or Yehoshua   from which we get the name Joshua. In Aramaic (the language he probably spoke at home) it was Isho or Yeshu. When the Gospels were translated from Hebrew into Greek, Yeshua became Iesous. When the Greek was rendered into Latin, it became Iesus. Joshua and Jesus were once the same name. Classical Latin had no letter J   Caesar was Iulius, not Julius. Except for a handful of borrowed foreign words, modern Italian still has no J. The letter J wasn t really in common use until the seventeenth century, at first to distinguish between words with  i  as a consonant, pronounced as  y  in  iest  (jest) and the short vowel sound  i , as in  it  or  inch . J wasn t used in English until around 1630, so Shakespeare never used it either   he wrote Romeo and Iuliet, King Iohn and, like Caesar himself, Iulius Caesar. In time, J came to be spoken in English like the Old English  dj  sound, as in  hedge , while in Spanish J still has a  Y  sound  and in French it s halfway between the two. In Hebrew Jesus  father s name was Yusuf, not Joseph, and Jesus would have been Yeshua ben Yusuf ( Joshua, son of Joseph ). It s possible neither of them were carpenters. The Hebrew word used to describe what they did is naggara (tekton in Greek). It only comes up twice in the New Testament and other possible meanings are  architect ,  stone mason  and  builder    so Jesus may have been a brickie rather than a chippie. In 2012 more than 4,000 American children were given the first name Jesus. There were also 800 Messiahs, and 29 Christs. 4) The holiday celebrated on 26 December every year is not Boxing Day Boxing Day in Britain is defined as  the first working day after Christmas , so it s not always on 26 December. For example, if Christmas Day falls on a Friday, Boxing Day is on Monday the 28th, because the Saturday and Sunday aren t working days. When Christmas falls on a Saturday, Boxing Day is on Monday the 27th (the next working day) and, to make up for Christmas Day being on a weekend, the Christmas Bank Holiday moves to Tuesday the 28th   so that, in one sense, Boxing Day sometimes comes before Christmas. But there is a holiday that always takes place on 26 December: the Feast of St Stephen. Appropriately for someone whose feast day comes the day after Christmas, St Stephen is the patron saint of headaches. He also looks after deacons, horses and coffin makers, and is the patron saint of stone workers   which is grimly ironic as he was the first Christian martyr to be stoned to death. St Stephen s Day is celebrated as an official public holiday throughout most of Europe; only Commonwealth countries celebrate Boxing Day instead. The name comes from the British tradition of giving small  Christmas boxes , containing money or treats, to workers for their service throughout the year. 5) You don t need to take down your Christmas decorations by Twelfth Night Taking down decorations on Twelfth Night (5 or 6 January) is a modern superstition. For many centuries they were kept up until Candlemas Eve, 1 February. Candlemas celebrates Mary and Joseph taking the baby Jesus to the Temple at Jerusalem and presenting him to the Lord. According to St Luke s gospel they had to sacrifice two pigeons to do so. Early Christmas decorations consisted mainly of greenery, which kept the house looking cheerful even when the weather outside was miserable. Some people clung to older, pre-Christian beliefs about these   namely that they contained woodland spirits who, if you left the decorations up, would cause mischief in your house. Careful householders took them down and burned them just to make sure. A photograph of a woman and a little girl decorating a Christmas tree, taken by Photographic Advertising Limited in about 1948. This photograph was sold for use in the Christmas 1948 issue of Mother magazine. (Photo by SSPL/Getty Images) In North America Candlemas is celebrated as Groundhog Day. Groundhogs are large rodents related to squirrels and, according to folklore, if it s cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day, spring will come early. If it s sunny, the winter weather will persist for six more weeks. Of course, the groundhog has no interest in weather forecasting: he s looking for a mate. Recent statistics, released by the USA s National Climatic Data Center, \"show no predictive skill for the groundhog\". Groundhog Day comes from an older medieval European tradition of the Candlemas Bear, where people watched for a hibernating bear as it awoke to get a similar weather prediction. The rarity of bears in France meant that this duty eventually had to be taken over by a man in a bear costume. A similar tradition in Germany is called Dachstag ( Badger Day ), and in Ireland they use a hedgehog. Until the 17th century  Christmas  lasted almost three months, from the Feast of St Martin on 11 November to Candlemas on 2 February. Although today it doesn t officially begin until Advent (the fourth Sunday before Christmas), the shops make it seem as if it s starting earlier and earlier   a process known as  Christmas Creep . This is getting faster, and it s not just retailers. Analysis of Internet searches in 2007 found people started looking for  Santa Claus ,  elf   and  presents  on 11 November. By 2013 they started on 25 August. Ad The Third QI Book of General Ignorance, published by Faber & Faber, is on sale now",

        "content": "Drawing on a wealth of evidence by contemporary observers, such as diaries, memoirs, letters, gossip and satire, Scandalous Liaisons: Charles II and His Court recounts the king s many mistresses, including Barbara Villiers and Nell Gwyn. Here, writing for HistoryExtra, Pritchard introduces you to the pleasure-seeking world of Charles II s court  Ad Most people think of Charles II as the  merry monarch , with his perky Cockney mistress, Nell Gwyn, at the centre of a court remarkable for its gaiety, extravagance, and amorous entanglements. The poet John Dryden, always agreeable to the ruling classes, described it as a  laughing, quaffing and unthinking time , but it is clear that there was widespread disapproval of this  brave new world , as is suggested by the title of poet Samuel Butler s Satire upon the Licentious Age of Charles the Second. Samuel Pepys recorded the king dancing to a popular tune of the time,  Cuckolds All A-Row , which well suggests the cheery, heartless, amoral world of the royal court. Restoration comedies provoked uneasy laughter about adultery and cuckoldry [an act of adultery committed by a married woman against her husband]. Performances such as these reflected a preoccupation of the upper classes, where young people were married off at unsuitably early ages, in pursuit of money and estates. A wealthy young heiress was considered valuable property, to be secured by any means. On several occasions, men carried off young ladies in coaches, either to marry them or extort money from their relatives. In Charles s day, steely-eyed mothers and prospective mothers-in-law were constantly on the hunt for a bride. While Charles was a young man in France, his own mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, worked hard to find him a suitable wife: aristocratic   preferably royal   with money to support him and his indigent entourage, and to finance Charles s soldiers in England. Various German princesses were wheeled out for examination   in person or through portraiture   dismissed with Charles s favourite oath,  Ods s fish! They are all dull and foggy . Just before Charles s restoration to the throne in 1660, Cardinal Mazarin s niece, Hortense Mancini, seemed a strong contender for the role of Charles s wife, but the Cardinal ultimately decided Charles was not a good investment (though some years later Hortense became one of Charles s mistresses). While this business was going on, a series of courtiers  young wives loyally laid themselves down for their (prospective) king, with a view to present or future rewards; Charles was always generous to those who did him service, even when he could not really afford it. These young women, like most of the women in Charles s life, would have been generally dismissed as  buttered buns    that is, as women who had been recently possessed by other men, and not to be taken seriously. One such woman was the young Lucy Walter, previously mistress to Algernon Sidney in London, then to Robert Sidney in Holland, probably at the court of Mary, Princess of Orange (sister of Charles). This relationship caused great anxiety to Charles s advisers, especially Edward Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon) and his mother, who feared Charles might marry a commoner with a bad reputation. Lucy bore Charles a son, later the Duke of Monmouth. Lucy also bore another child, not by Charles, and the affair fizzled out before her early death in November 1658. Lucy was replaced, very promptly, by Mrs Barbara Palmer, better known as Barbara Villiers, later Countess Castlemaine and Duchess of Cleveland   titles earned by her own efforts in the bedroom. King Charles II's mistress Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, Countess of Castlemaine, c1660s. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Charles had many mistresses in both France and England. One of his servants, Thomas Chiffinch, used to bring them up to him via the back stairs to his room. Charles also had liaisons with many actresses: Mistress Knight, Mistress Weaver; and one, Moll Davis, was given a house; a pension of  1,000 a year; and an expensive ring. Moll s rival, Nell Gwyn, once put a powerful laxative in her competitor s food when she was due to be in bed with Charles. One woman who didn't want to sleep with Charles was the beautiful young Frances Stuart: she held on to her virginity, despite all Charles's pleadings, and eventually eloped with the Duke of Richmond   much to the king's fury. Another lady put in Charles s way was the celebrated Italian beauty and sexual adventuress, Hortense Mancini. She was  imported  by Ralph Montagu, the English ambassador to France, who was hoping to supplant Barbara Villiers [with whom the king had lost interest] and further his own career. Unfortunately for Ralph, Hortense was not interested in political manoeuvring, only in gambling and sex; her affair with Charles did not last long. A philandering brother While in France with Charles in May 1660, the king s brother, James, Duke of York, enjoying the licentious atmosphere of the court there, had an affair with Anne Hyde, the daughter of the future Earl of Clarendon, the king's chancellor. Anne went through a form of marriage with him [possibly not performed by a priest, but by verbal promises only]. By the time the couple returned to England, Anne was pregnant, and despite colourful stories accusing her of promiscuity (spread by courtiers friendly to James), James had to marry her properly [by chaplain], which wrecked his chances of marrying a wealthy foreign aristocrat or princess. As for public opinion, most people likely tended to agree with the Earl of Sandwich, who told Pepys that, among his father s many sayings [his father was the previous Earl of Sandwich] was one, that  He that gets a wench with child and marries her afterward, it was as if a man should shit in his hat and clap it on his head . Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, who became the first wife of James, Duke of York, the future King James II. She was the mother of two later queens of England, Mary II and Anne. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Anne had a difficult time at court, sneered at for being a commoner and suspected of being a social climber, but she behaved with courage and dignity. James s marriage did not hinder his continual, relentless philandering, however. A distressed Anne took to comfort eating, becoming increasingly larger, while James s energetic activities in the hunting field (and bedroom) kept him thin. One of James s early affairs was with Lady Anne Carnegie, later Countess of Southesk, who, as Anne Hamilton, had been a teenage friend of Barbara Villiers, a lady who is remembered as being one of the most notorious of Charles s many mistresses. Trying to be discreet, James apparently took the precaution of visiting the lady only formally, accompanied by a third person (who would wait in an outer room). On one occasion, the person playing gooseberry was Richard Talbot, a courtier and friend of both Charles and James. While waiting, Talbot looked out of the window, and saw a man whom he recognised coming into the house. Talbot, who had been abroad, did not know that Lord Carnegie, Lady Carnegie's husband, had been made Earl of Southesk.  Welcome, Carnegie, dear old friend! Where the devil have you been? Why are you here? Are you, too, after Lady Southesk? If so, you had better go away, for I must tell you, the Duke of York is in love with her, and is even now inside, in her chamber.  The dumbfounded earl was hustled downstairs, out of his own house and into his carriage. Talbot went back, impatient to tell the couple the amusing story of the hopeful visitor. He was very surprised that his story gave them no pleasure at all, and was only annoyed that Carnegie had changed his title to Earl of Southesk without telling him. The story does not end yet. As Pepys and others at court heard, when Southesk realised his wife was sleeping with the duke, he went to an infected whore in order to get the pox. Southesk then deliberately infected his wife, who in turn transferred it to the duke. Pepys thought this  the most pernicious and foul piece of revenge that ever [he] heard of . Whether or not the story was true, the duke did contract the pox, which he in turn transferred to his other partners. Royal mistresses Many court ladies sought the prestige of becoming a royal mistress, if only for a while. One such woman was the pretty young Margaret Brooke, who indicated her willingness to James early on, but would not go further until she was safely married. At 18, she charmed 50-year-old Sir John Denham: a tall, thin, stork-like poet and gambler, who bet against the odds by marrying her. Almost immediately Margaret became James s very public mistress. This was a situation the court wits relished, and many lampoons and vulgar verses circulated, mocking the unequal marriage and cuckolding. This was too much for Sir John, who, for a while, went mad, reportedly telling the king that he was the Holy Ghost. Margaret Brooke, Lady Denham, c1660s. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Soon after this, Margaret fell seriously ill; on her deathbed she accused Sir John of poisoning her with a chocolate drink. A post-mortem analysis was performed but, not surprisingly, no traces of poison were found. The story of poisoning was, nevertheless, widely believed. Some thought Sir John was responsible, while others blamed the Duchess of York [Anne Hyde, daughter of the Earl of Clarendon]. Let us now return to Barbara Villiers, who was recognised as the pre-eminent court beauty. Passionate, demanding, insatiable (sexually and financially), and violent-tempered, she dominated Charles and court life   poor Catherine of Braganza, brought from Portugal to be Charles s queen, stood no chance against the glamour queen of the court, (not least because Barbara was notably fecund and Catherine proved barren), screwing vast sums of money from the king, while being openly unfaithful. Barbara s many lovers included actors such as Charles Hart (Nell Gwyn s first lover); Jacob Hall, a muscular gymnast and acrobat; the court ladies   cock of the walk , Harry Jermyn; and the youthful John Churchill (later Duke of Marlborough). Barbara was generous in rewarding her lovers (with Charles s money), though the swaggering boasts of one, John Ellis, were cut short when she had him castrated. Not surprisingly, Barbara was widely hated. One ballad included the verse, Next comes Castlemaine, That prerogative quean; If I had such a bitch I would spay her; She swives like a stoat, Goes to t leg and foot, Level coil with a prince and a player.  Prerogative  suggests Barbara s arrogance, while the Oxford English Dictionary derives  level coil  from the French lever le cul, or  hitch-buttock . Barbara s overbearing behaviour, her dreadful public reputation, and the sheer expense of paying her costs and gambling debts, meant that her power and influence over the king eventually declined, and as she spent less time at court, other mistresses superseded her. Some of these mistresses were deliberately put in the king s way by court politicians hoping for indirect influence, usually in vain. One such woman was Nell Gwyn, who rose from very humble beginnings to theatre stardom. She became a long-term favourite of Charles, enjoyed not only for her sexuality but her wit, entertainment value, and good nature. c1670, English stage actress Nell Gwyn, mistress of King Charles II. She bore the king at least one illegitimate son. Original Artwork: Engraving by Walter L Colls, from an engraving by Valck after a painting by Sir Peter Lely. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) More important, emotionally, to Charles was Nell s great rival, from the opposite end of the social spectrum, Louise de K roualle. Louise was brought from the French court, and openly took part in English court politics, hoping to promote French interests. Nell constantly mocked and abused her:  Squintabella  was one nickname, for the slight cast she had in one eye, as well as  the weeping willow , for her tendency to weep when thwarted or upset. Once, when Louise had been appointed Duchess of Portsmouth (as a reward for her sexual favours) she said condescendingly to Nell, who was looking particularly fine,  Nelly, you are grown rich, I believe, by your dress; why woman you are fine enough to be a queen . Nelly riposted,  You are entirely right, madam, and I am whore enough to be a duchess.  As it was, at the end, as Charles lay on his deathbed, his thoughts were likely with both women. Louise, he said, he loved and always had, and added, according to legend,  Let not poor Nelly starve . The fact was that in Charles s later years (only in middle age, as we would understand it), his sexual appetite   and, it was widely rumoured, sexual capability   declined, so that more of his leisure time was spent sailing and fishing, while his women settled for a quieter time at court (while picking up other lovers along the way). By the end of Charles s reign, there was an increasing sense of weariness and disgust at what was seen as a degenerate court. In 1683, even one of the previously most debauched libertine courtiers, Charles Sackville, wrote a lengthy satire, or diatribe   beginning: Go on, my muse, and with bold voice proclaim The vicious lives and long detested fame Of scoundrel lords, and their lewd wives  amours, Pimp statesmen, canting priests, Court bawds and whores  The picture Sackville sketched was harsh, but not without truth. Certainly the court had devoted itself to pleasure and selfishness, superficial gaiety covering corruption. A good time was had, but it was not really a good time. The intrigues and liaisons were often regarded even then as scandalous; but perhaps, at a distance of more than 300 years, they retain some value as entertainment.

        "title": "The big questions of ancient Egypt",
        "content": "What is the earliest evidence of  art  in Egypt? The oldest graphic activity ever recorded in Egypt   indeed, in the whole of north Africa   was carved into the sandstone cliffs of Qurta around 25 miles south of Edfu, between Luxor and Aswan. Recently scientifically dated at 19,000 years old by Dr Dirk Huyge, director of the Belgian Mission who has studied the site since 2005, the gallery comprises at least 185 individual images, almost three-quarters of which depict the now-extinct, powerfully built wild cattle known as aurochs, the ancestors of domestic cows. Ad Some of these huge creatures   almost 2 metres long   have  cut  marks scratched around the head and neck area. Huyge believes that these  cuts  have some kind of symbolical meaning, possibly as an attempt to ensure a successful outcome for hunting expeditions. The Qurta scenes also feature hippos, gazelle, birds, fish and strange hybrid beings, along with several stylised female figures representing the earliest Egyptian attempts at self-portraits. Huyge has dubbed the rich repertoire of scenes a veritable  Lascaux along the Nile , observing that these lifelike and vivid images are  uncannily close  in style to European cave art such as that seen at Lascaux in France, which also features aurochs and other large animals. He adds that  perhaps direct influence or cultural exchange over such a long distance is not as improbable as it seems  The Mediterranean Sea at the time of the last Ice Age was at least 100 metres lower than it is now: could it be that Palaeolithic people established an intercontinental exchange of iconographic and symbolic concepts?  Who was the real Tutankhamun? Though undeniably Egypt s most famous pharaoh, little is known about Tutankhamun. When born, probably around 1346 BC at the city of Amarna, some 180 miles south of modern Cairo, he was named Tutankhaten    Living Image of [sun god] Aten . His father was the so-called heretic pharaoh Akhenaten, while his mother may have been Kiya, one of Akhenaten s minor wives, or possibly even Akhenaten s chief wife and co-ruler Nefertiti. Tutankhaten took the throne at his father s death in c1336 BC, changing his name to the more familiar Tutankhamun when the Aten cult was terminated and worship of the state god Amun reinstated. He ruled until his death in c1327 BC, the cause of which remains a focus of debate. Studies of Tutankhamun s tomb and its contents also continue to reveal all manner of unexpected details. Not least is the possibility that at least 80 per cent of his grave goods were originally made for other members of his family, from the famous gold throne to at least one of his three golden coffins. Even the gold death mask  had originally been a Nefertiti piece , claims Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves. Why did hieroglyphs develop? The deceptively simple-looking picture writing evolved over several millennia into a sophisticated system using thousands of signs. First described as hieroglyphs ( sacred carvings ) by the Greeks, they were largely used to create the ritual texts covering the walls of temples and tombs, while a form of hieroglyphic shorthand known as  hieratic  was used by the literate elite. These were mainly the scribes and officials who administered the country for the king, even before Egypt emerged as the world s first nation state in c3100 BC. German archaeologists excavating the tombs of Egypt s earliest rulers at Abydos in the late 1980s discovered some 150 small labels of bone, ivory and wood carved with simple pictograms    proto-hieroglyphs    describing everything from bolts of linen to jars of oil, together with their quantity and place of origin. The labels, once attached to grave goods, have been dated to c3250 BC and are the earliest evidence for the way officials raised and recorded taxes in kind. They are among the most important documents in history, as the pictograms form a phonetically readable script that some claim was the earliest writing in the world   apparently predating that of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia. When were dead bodies first mummified? Mummification is so synonymous with ancient Egypt that most people assume it has been completely understood for some time. Yet recent research is rewriting much of what was previously known   from the most effective techniques used during the 14th century BC  New Kingdom  to the preservatives that were used to obtain the most lifelike results. The origins of embalming are now known to be much earlier than the Pyramid Age (from c2600 BC). Well before that time, linen was used to wrap bodies at sites such as Mostagedda (north of Luxor), some of it coated in a toffee-like substance. But only in 2014 was this substance finally identified, by archaeological chemist Dr Stephen Buckley of the University of York, as a blend of oils, fats and antibacterial pine resin. He discovered that  some of the ingredients were brought from the north-east Mediterranean. For example, the pine resin must have come from what is now south-eastern Turkey.  But such long-distance trade links were not the only big surprise. Carbon dating carried out on the Mostagedda linen by researchers at the University of Oxford revealed that the wrappings and mixtures both date to c4300 BC   some 1,700 years earlier than mummification was previously believed to have first been used in Egypt. How many pyramids are there? It is estimated that 138 pyramids survive in Egypt, varying widely in layout, size, location and purpose. The first was built in c2650 BC for King Djoser. His bench-shaped  mastaba  tomb was embellished to form a six-tiered, 60 metre-high step pyramid. Snefru (c2613 c2589 BC), the greatest of all Egypt s pyramid builders, moved 9 million tonnes of stone to build three successive pyramids as he refined his plans, and his son Khufu created the Great Pyramid of Giza. This was the standard royal tomb till superseded in c1750 BC by rock-cut tombs such as those in Luxor s Valley of the Kings. Some smaller pyramids are believed to have served as territorial markers or tax-collecting points; these were built throughout the Nile Valley as far south as Aswan in around 2600 BC. How old was the oldest known  Egyptian ? The remains of the earliest human yet found in Egypt were discovered by Belgian archaeologists in 1994 during their excavation of a Stone Age quarry at Taramsa Hill near Dendera, about 40 miles north of Luxor. They unexpectedly uncovered the shallow pit grave of a young child. Its body was carefully buried in a seated position, oriented east toward the rising sun, with its head resting back on a sand bed to face skyward. The child, who lived during the late Pleistocene, approximately 60,000 55,000 years ago, was aged between 8 and 10 when it died, though the remains were so fragile and fragmentary that it was impossible to determine whether they were male or female. Not only is this the oldest known burial from north Africa, but it also provides a vital missing link in the human story. As the anthropologists who examined the child s remains explained:  The location of this find is significant, because it s on a possible dispersion route of modern humans from Africa into Asia and Europe between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago.  Was Cleopatra an Egyptian? Cleopatra VII  the Great  was the last pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty (305 30 BC). The Macedonian king Alexander the Great had taken Egypt in 332 BC during his conquest of the Persian empire; on his death, Ptolemy I   one of Alexander s generals and rumoured half-brother   took control. His descendants   15 male pharaohs, all called Ptolemy   shared the throne with female co-rulers. Cleopatra VII ruled first with her father, then her brothers and finally her son (by Julius Caesar) Ptolemy XV, called Caesarion. Though the Ptolemies initially spoke Greek and clung to Greek culture, they gradually became influenced by Egypt s ancient traditions. In 181 BC Ptolemy V was mummified rather than cremated, and Ptolemy VIII married one of his daughters into the Egyptian nobility. Cleopatra VII was born in Egypt, as were most of her predecessors, but was the first to learn the Egyptian language and gain the support of her subjects against the growing power of Rome. Images within Egypt s temples show her as a typical Egyptian figure with traditional regalia and long hair. However, classical-style marble portrait busts show her wavy locks swept up in a Greek-style bun. One painted image even suggests red hair. Controversy about Cleopatra s ethnicity continues to rage; the identities of her mother and grandmother are unknown   they might have been members of the Egyptian aristocracy. Are any discoveries still to be made? This is perhaps the question most often asked of Egyptologists   and the answer is a resounding yes! Some of the most exciting discoveries are being made in museums. Last year museum staff in Wigan, combining their collections in new storage facilities, rediscovered antiquities covering the entire span of Egypt s ancient history, from c3500 BC to the early centuries AD, the highlight being a gilded face from an 18th-dynasty coffin. Also last year, a re-examination of ancient linen wrappings from Mostagedda stored in Bolton Museum pushed back the origins of mummification by 1,700 years. Even the British Museum still produces surprises. In 2012, computed tomography (CT) scans revealed that the naturally mummified body of a man   known to generations of schoolchildren as  Ginger , thanks to his faded red hair   had literally been stabbed in the back around 3500 BC. In Egypt itself, of course, new finds are announced almost every week. Even the Valley of the Kings has not yet been completely explored. Nor, it seems, has its most famous tomb. In 2014, high-resolution scans of the walls of Tutankhamun s burial chamber revealed the outlines of two intact sealed doorways. Some experts believe these may lead to additional unexplored chambers. So, much like the iconic golden death mask, even the tomb of Tutankhamun still conceals secrets. Joann Fletcher is honorary visiting professor at the University of York.

        "content": "Born: 27 January 1859 in the Crown Prince s Palace, Berlin, Prussia Ad Died: 4 June 1941 in Doorn, Netherlands Remembered for: Being the last German kaiser and king of Prussia, and one of the most prominent figures of the First World War. Ruled: 1888 1918 Family: Wilhelm s father was Frederick III, who was briefly the kaiser of Germany and king of Prussia (Wilhelm s grandfather, Wilhelm I, ruled between January 1871 March 1888). His mother was Victoria, the eldest daughter of British Queen Victoria. In 1881 Wilhelm married his second cousin, Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, with whom he had seven children. Augusta died in 1921, and the following year Wilhelm married Hermine Reuss of Greiz. His life: Wilhelm was born in 1859. It was a difficult birth, during which Wilhelm sustained nerve damage that left one of his arms permanently paralysed   a condition that he attempted to conceal throughout his life.  Treatments  to which Wilhelm was subjected during his childhood included electrotherapy and having a dead hare wrapped around his arm. It was thought that these may  cure  him of his condition. In 1874 he began his schooling at the Kassel Gymnasium, and in 1877 he went on to attend the University of Bonn for four terms, where he studied politics and law. To mark his 18th birthday, Wilhelm was invested with the Order of the Garter by his grandmother, Queen Victoria, of whom he was extremely fond. On 15 June 1888 Wilhelm s father died of cancer of the larynx, having ruled for just 99 days. At 29 years old, Wilhelm became emperor of Germany. During his rule, Wilhelm was determined to expand Germany s power. He set out to improve the country s economy and create a naval force that could rival that of the British Royal Navy, which was one of the leading naval fleets in the world.

(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) In 1890 Wilhelm forced the chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, to resign and he took control of Germany s foreign and domestic policies. Throughout his reign, Wilhelm encouraged the development of the arts and sciences, and was determined to improve Germany s social welfare and the standards of its schools. In 1911 he established the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, which became a prominent centre for scientific research. In 1896 Wilhelm antagonised Britain when he congratulated Paul Kruger, president of the South African Republic, on his success in defeating the British troops that had attempted to raid a South African territory. Tensions were further heightened in 1908 when Wilhelm, in an interview in The Daily Telegraph, suggested that a proportion of the German population was  anti-English . Around this time his relationship with his extended family deteriorated. He reputedly resented his uncle, King Edward VII, and his relationship with his cousin, Tsar Nicholas II, also became strained. After a Serbian rebel assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary on 28 June 1914, Wilhelm encouraged Austria-Hungary to retaliate against Serbia. But, as countries across Europe became embroiled in the First World War, German military generals excluded Wilhelm from key decisions and he became merely a figurehead for the German army. After the US joined the war in 1917, the Allied Powers (including Britain) began to make significant gains. After years of continuous fighting, by 1918 Germany was experiencing serious shortages of troops and ammunition. In 1918 rumours spread that Germany was planning to surrender to the Allies, and questions began to circulate about Wilhelm s position in power. On 9 November 1918, the German chancellor Prince Max von Baden preempted Wilhelm s abdication and proclaimed publicly that Wilhelm had surrendered his powers. Wilhelm subsequently consented and officially abdicated his throne, fleeing to the Netherlands. After the armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, officially ending the war, the Allies attempted to force the Dutch government to extradite Wilhelm, to be tried as a war criminal. The Dutch government refused, instead allowing him to remain in exile in the Netherlands. While in exile, Wilhelm wrote two memoirs: Memoirs, 1878 1918 (1922) and My Early Life (1926). With the rise of the Nazi party in Germany in the early 1930s, rumours spread that Wilhelm might be invited back to Germany to retake his throne, but these proved unfounded. He lived out the remainder of his life in the Dutch countryside. Ad On 4 June 1941 Wilhelm died of a pulmonary embolism in Doorn, aged 82.",

        "title": "Theodora: from prostitution to empress of the eastern Roman empire",
        "content": "When faced with death, the Byzantine emperor Justinian was a cowardly figure. The same could not be said of his wife, Theodora. Ad During a revolt in Constantinople in the year 532, Justinian was ready to make a run for it, but the audacious empress implored him to stay to save his reign. She arose from her throne and uttered the phrase  If you wish to save yourself, my lord, there is no difficulty  As for me, I agree with the saying that royal purple is the noblest shroud . But Theodora had not always been so majestic. Born in the hippodrome to a bear keeper and actress, she came from the lowest rung of society. Nonetheless, Theodora s involvement with politics began at a young age. Theodora s involvement with politics began at a young age Her family were members of the Green faction, supporters of the corresponding Green hippodrome team, whose followers from the working classes possessed a degree of political influence. Their rivals were the Blues, a team backed by the upper and ruling classes, who also held considerable political leverage. Her father died when she was young, so Theodora s mother quickly remarried in order to avoid destitution. She attempted to get her new husband into the vacant bear-baiting position by parading her downtrodden children in front of the Greens. However, her emotional appeal was ridiculed and laughed at. Sensing an opportunity to steal support from their rivals, the Blues gave Theodora s stepfather a job, saving the family from poverty. From this moment, Theodora s loyalty remained with the Blues, a switch that would define her destiny. Shunned by society As she grew up, Theodora took to the stage to earn money. Her childhood was spent performing circus tricks with her sister, and as she blossomed into a teenager, she moved onto more risqu  performances. Soon, Theodora was known throughout the Empire for her interpretation of Leda and the Swan, the infamous Ancient Greek myth of Zeus turning himself into a swan to sleep with a young woman. Theodora provided a colourful version of the story by scattering grain on her nether regions and encouraging geese to peck it from her. Off stage, wealthier clients would pay for her sexual services, and though it provided a source of income, it meant she was shunned by society. Wealthier clients would pay for her sexual services, and though it provided a source of income, it meant she was shunned by society. At the tender age of 16, Theodora believed she d found an escape from her former life when she journeyed with civil servant Hecebolus to his new posting in Libya. Here she lived as his mistress for four years, but he abused her and eventually threw her out onto the streets, penniless. Her determination saw her through, and she scraped together enough money to get herself and her infant daughter to Alexandria. She encountered two influential religious leaders, who identified as Monophysite Christians. These so-called  heretics  stood at loggerheads to the mainstream Orthodox Church, as they believed that Jesus never had a mortal form, and was an entirely divine being. Theodora s interactions with them moved her so much that she converted, and remained steadfastly committed to Monophysitism. Back to Constantinople Theodora s luck began to change when she befriended Macedonia, a dancer and member of the Blue faction. With her help, Theodora was able to return to Constantinople, and even land a respectable job as a wool-spinner. Macedonia also introduced Theodora to future emperor Justinian, a valuable Blue ally. He was instantly infatuated with her beauty and wit, and desired to make her his wife as soon as possible. However, Theodora s past haunted her, and an old Roman law prevented high society from marrying former actresses. Justinian took advantage of his elderly uncle the Emperor in AD 525, and changed the law to let  truly repentant  actresses wed those of high rank. They married almost immediately. Two years later, Justinian and Theodora sat as rulers of the mighty Eastern Roman Empire. Theodora proved her worth during the Nika riots of 532. A fight between the Blues and Greens at the hippodrome culminated in a violent uprising, in which the teams both attempted to overthrow the dynasty and proclaim the unwitting commander Hypatius as emperor. Theodora was ruthless. After convincing her husband to remain in the city and face the rioters, they sent loyal soldiers to the place where she grew up. The exits were sealed off, and in the massacre that ensued, 30,000 people were slaughtered. Hypatius was brought to the palace, and though Justinian was willing to spare the rioters  figurehead, Theodora wanted to make an example of him, and he was promptly executed. What were the Nika Riots? The most violent riots in the history of Constantinople, and all because of chariot racing A week of rioting in January AD 532 ended with Constantinople wrecked, tens of thousands dead, and Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I almost overthrown. The Romans took chariot racing very seriously. Chariot teams were split into colour-coded factions   Blue, Green, Red and White   with loyal groups of supporters, called demes. Violence among them was common enough at races in the Hippodrome (like football hooliganism today), but after one particularly bloody fight Justinian set an example by executing the ringleaders. Job done, except two escaped   one Blue and one Green   and sought sanctuary in a church, which inadvertently united the demes against the emperor. With tension mounting, the next race turned even uglier than normal. All factions took up the cry Nika ( Win  or  Victory ) against Justinian and poured into the streets for a full week of rioting, during which the mob declared a new emperor and the original Hagia Sophia fell victim to the flames. Order was only restored when Justinian sent in his troops to trap the demes in the Hippodrome and cut them down in the thousands. In the aftermath, the royal couple set about restoring the stability of the Byzantine world. Theodora s work as empress was characterised by an increase in women s rights and religious tolerance. She fought for laws that banned pimps, proscribed the death penalty for rape, and gave mothers custody rights over children. She also ensured religious protection for Monophysites within the palace walls, even though Justinian himself was Orthodox. Theodora died at age 48, probably of breast cancer. In her memory, Justinian continued to protect Monophysites throughout the Empire, despite his personal beliefs. The couple s mark on Constantinople is still visible today at Hagia Sophia, the breathtaking church they built together after the Nika revolts   a lavish display of their wealth and influence over the Empire.

        "content": "Recounting tales from 1,000 years of British history, Secrets of Great British Castles captures the might and majesty of Edinburgh, Cardiff, York, Lancaster, Leeds and Arundel castles and brings to life the heroic and notorious characters who once walked their corridors. Ad Here, writing for History Extra, Jones explores their hidden history  Edinburgh Castle Edinburgh Castle is one of Britain s most famous landmarks, which is why millions of people walk up the Royal Mile to visit it every year. Built on a volcanic crag above the city the castle looks out to the Firth of Forth; walking around its sprawling courtyards and rooms is a journey through nearly 1,000 years of Scottish history. Probably the most notorious event in Edinburgh Castle s history is the Black Dinner, which took place in 1440 during the minority of King James II of Scotland. The Earl of Douglas, himself little more than a boy, was invited to dine at the castle, but at a pre-arranged moment a black bull s head was carried out on a platter: it was the signal for Douglas and his brother to be wrestled from the table, dragged outside and murdered. The story has gained several layers of salacious detail in its many retellings down the years, and most recently it became, in mutated form, the Red Wedding in the fantasy television series Game of Thrones. In that version, the Starks are  well, if you ve seen Game of Thrones, you ll remember. No spoilers, as they say! There s so much history to absorb in Edinburgh that it is almost overwhelming. The castle is wound into the life of Mary, Queen of Scots, her son James VI and I and the epic, long-running inter-family feud between the Tudor and Stuart dynasties, which took place during the 16th century. It is also home to the Scottish crown jewels and a healthy array of heavy artillery including the One O Clock Gun, which sounds the time for shipping in the Firth of Forth. But perhaps my favourite building of all is a simple but beautiful chapel dedicated to St Margaret. It was built around 1130 and is reputed to be the oldest building in Scotland. Cardiff Castle Cardiff Castle is very dear to my heart, as I ve spent many happy hours drinking in the shadow of its great gates, in the Goat Major pub on High Street. It s rather different in character and scale to many of the more famous Welsh castles of Snowdonia, not least because unlike Caernarfon, Conwy, Beaumaris and its other northern cousins, Cardiff Castle has spent much of its life as a fortified home rather than simply a military garrison. The keep in the centre of the castle grounds dates to Norman times, and Cardiff had one very illustrious Norman occupant: William the Conqueror s eldest son, Robert Curthose, who was imprisoned there for more than a decade by his younger brother, Henry I of England. Curthose eventually died in prison at a grand old age, but he left behind his maudlin reflections on life in jail. One poem in Welsh is associated with Curthose:  woe to him who is not old enough to die,  it reads. The most eye-catching parts of the castle today are the rooms created by the architect William Burges on behalf of Cardiff s super-wealthy 19th-century owner, John Crichton-Stuart, the 3rd Marquess of Bute. The marquess s vast industrial wealth combined with Burges  genius for neo-gothic interior design produced a range of exotic and extraordinarily lavish rooms, lending a cod-medieval sensibility to high aristocratic living.

(Channel 5 Productions) York Castle York Castle is mostly ruined now, and locals call the keep that remains on its mound Clifford s Tower, after the family who became hereditary constables in the late 16th century. Unusually, the tower is clover-shaped and you can still climb up its slippery stone staircases to explore rooms dating to York Castle s Plantagenet-era glory days. So much of York s unique, rich and sometimes very dark history can be linked to Clifford s Tower. The castle originated with William the Conqueror, who put two fortresses by the River Ouse as he attempted to subject the Viking-influenced north to his rule. In 1190 it was the scene of a terrible pogrom, which wiped out the city s entire Jewish population at the hands of a rioting mob inflamed by the crusading fervour of the day. In the early 14th century it was used to house Templar prisoners as they awaited trial following the dissolution of the order under Edward II. When the north rose in protest at Henry VIII s dissolution of the monasteries, York castle was again at the heart of the action. Robert Aske, a lawyer who led the protests, was taken as a prisoner from London to York and hanged in chains from the castle walls. Rather later, another famous prisoner died after being imprisoned in the cells of the jail across the road from Clifford s Tower. He was Richard Turpin, an Essex horse-thief now immortalised in the legend of Dick Turpin and his wonder-horse, Black Bess. Today you can sit in Turpin s (supposed) cell. Fortunately, they let you out! The remains of York Castle. (  Kevintate/Dreamstime.com) Lancaster Castle Lancaster Castle was, until 2011, a working prison, and there were few eerier moments filming the new series than walking around the abandoned cells attached to the old medieval fortress. The Birmingham Six were held there during their notorious trial in 1975, which also took place at Lancaster Castle, in the crown court that is still in operation there. The  Birmingham Six  were six Irishmen resident in Birmingham who were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for two pub bombings in the city that killed 21 people. Their convictions were later quashed and they were released after serving nearly 17 years in jail. Having functioned as a court, a prison and a centre of royal justice, Lancaster Castle is a window into 800 years of crime and punishment. Fittingly, it was once a possession of King John, the Plantagenet king who was a keen student of the law in his own right and who was forced in 1215 to agree to Magna Carta, a document revered today as a pillar of British constitutional principles. One of the most notorious cases to have been heard at Lancaster was that of the so-called  Pendle Witches , eight women and two men from nearby villages who were accused of summoning demons and cursing their neighbours. They were almost all convicted at the court on the evidence of a disturbed nine-year old girl named Jennet Device and were taken to be strung up on nearby Gallows Hill, as were so many of Lancaster s other convicts over the centuries. Some convicts, however, were spared the noose and instead sent to the transportation hulks in the south of England, which took them on to a term of penal servitude in far-flung places like Australia. Making the new series we met the descendent of a sheep-rustler sentenced to exactly this fate   in a delicious irony, she is now a successful criminal prosecutor  down under . Lancaster Castle. (  Steve Allen/Dreamstime.com) Leeds Castle Described as  the loveliest castle in the world , Leeds Castle has hosted everything from Plantagenet banquets to G8 summits. It is in an undeniably stunning location not far from Maidstone in Kent. (Don t go to Leeds in Yorkshire: you ll be hunting a long time for their castle!) Leeds once had a close association with Eleanor of Castile, first wife of Edward I  Longshanks . Eleanor was a successful property magnate and she transformed Leeds Castle, making improvements that included erecting the central building known as the Gloriette and installing a bathhouse, the remains of which have recently been investigated by archaeologists digging in a drained section of the moat. In 1520, Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon stopped at Leeds Castle on their way to the Field of the Cloth of Gold in northern France, an event which is commemorated in a painting that is replicated in the castle today: the  Embarkation from Dover . You can also spot Catherine s personal symbol, the pomegranate, carved into the castle s fireplaces. Much of the stately splendour of Leeds today is the work of Olive, Lady Baillie, an American heiress who purchased the castle in the 1920s and renovated its interiors over many decades. The castle became the venue for parties with guests including European royalty, American films stars and leading British politicians. But Lady Baillie was a philanthropist as well as a hostess; she turned the castle into a hospital in the Second World War and left it in trust when she died so that it could be enjoyed after she was gone. Leeds Castle, Kent. (  Emanuele Leoni/ Dreamstime.com) Arundel Castle Arundel Castle is today someone s house, and I almost felt rude pitching up there this summer to nose around. It is the seat of the Duke of Norfolk, England s first peer, and it has been home to his family for centuries. The Fitzalan-Howards (earls of Arundel as well as dukes of Norfolk) have a family story that ranges from medieval war to 17th-century art collection. Arundel Castle is a superb showcase for their particular rich slice of British history. There has been a castle at Arundel since William the Conqueror gave this swathe of southern England to his friend and supporter Roger de Montgomery in 1067/68. During the 12th-century  Anarchy  (the civil war between King Stephen and his cousin Empress Matilda) there was a stand-off here that nearly ended in Matilda s capture. Royal connections have continued ever since. During the 14th century Arundel was home to Richard Fitzalan, a friend, comrade and financier to the great Edward III, who made a fortune out of funding and fighting the Hundred Years  War. Suits of armour adorning Arundel s walls still speak to those medieval glory years. Arundel Castle. (  Areinwald/Dreamstime.com) The art of Arundel castle tells the story of another great era, when the 17th-century  collector earl , Thomas Howard, toured Europe cherry-picking artefacts and sending them home to England. Many of the marble statues he collected can now be seen in Oxford s Ashmolean Museum, but Arundel Castle is fairly heaving with works by the painters he patronised, among them Anthony van Dyck and Daniel Mytens.Almost as grand as Arundel s huge buildings are its extraordinary gardens, but my favourite spot is the cricket pitch on the other side of the pretty little town. There aren t many more picturesque grounds in England, maybe even the world. Not a bad back garden, I guess.

        "title": "The search for Henry I: what you need to know",
        "content": "Over the summer, a team of researchers from the Hidden Abbey Project carried out ground-penetrating radar (GPR) research of the Reading Abbey area   the final resting place of Henry I and his wife, Adeliza. The first phase of the project aims to uncover the full extent of the abbey church, which was largely destroyed in 1539 during the dissolution of the monasteries. Initial results from the radar scan show three potential graves, possibly including that of Henry I. Ad It has already been established that Henry was buried in front of the high altar, with members of his family buried in specific locations around him. If the team can successfully locate the high altar, they will be able to determine the likely burial location of Henry I. Digging work is due to begin in the car park in the autumn, and the project s findings will feature in a planned television documentary with Darlow Smithson Productions. Henry I, the youngest of William the Conqueror s four sons, founded Reading Abbey in 1121 as a royal mausoleum, and is buried there along with his second wife, Adeliza, and great-grandson William of Poitiers. We caught up with Philippa Langley, who instigated the Hidden Abbey Project for Reading, to find out more  Q: What can you tell us about the graves that have been discovered? A: The ground-penetrating radar survey has uncovered the eastern end of the medieval abbey church beneath what is now the Ministry of Justice car park. The chancel, apse and ambulatory areas are shown in quite stunning detail. Three potential grave slots are also marked in this location. Two are positioned beside each other towards the eastern wall of the apse with the third slightly further west, with half of it seemingly under the dividing wall with the playground of the adjacent nursery school. The walls of the nave and far western extent of the abbey church are, at this stage, proving more difficult to locate, possibly due to higher soil levels in the Forbury Gardens or having been robbed. Q: Can you speculate as to who the graves might belong to? What would you say are the chances of one of them belonging to Henry I? A: It might be possible to speculate who the graves belong to when we can determine the location of the high altar. The location of the high altar is one of the Hidden Abbey Project s key research questions and will be a hugely significant discovery in terms of understanding this potentially unique Romanesque building. It is currently believed that the high altar is located in the choir of the church, which would place the grave of Henry I further west under the nursery school building. Recently, the eastern playground of the nursery has also been suggested, and either of these locations might be correct. This is because we know that Henry was buried in front of the high altar. However, if the original (Norman) high altar is located against the eastern wall of the apse, as seen for example at Tewkesbury Abbey, then one of the two graves positioned side by side in the car park could be Henry. The other might then be Constance of York (1374 1416), who was buried near Henry, and is also believed to have been placed before the altar. The positioning of the high altar against the eastern wall of Tewkesbury Abbey could be a potential pointer for Reading, as Tewkesbury is a direct contemporary, being consecrated in 1121, the same year Reading Abbey was founded. Tewkesbury was also financed by Henry I s illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester. However, until we can place a targeted trench in the Ministry of Justice car park to uncover and fully understand the east end of the Norman abbey church, and potentially locate its high altar, we have only these various hypotheses to go on. In essence, if the Hidden Abbey Project is successful in locating the high altar of the abbey, this will then give us the key not only to understanding the abbey church and potentially its wider abbey precinct, but also to determining the burial location of King Henry I of England. Whatever the authorities involved decide to do with this information, the question then remains whether Henry s grave is there or was removed by later development work and/or desecrated in the mid-16th century. Grave desecration seems unlikely at this stage given the religious times it was said to have taken place, and to have been carried out by Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, uncle of the then reigning monarch, Edward VI. If Seymour had received royal orders to desecrate a royal tomb, this would have set an extraordinary precedent. Or did Seymour simply decide in the zeal of the final destruction of the abbey s east end that greed was good? If the medieval king had been buried in a silver casket, Seymour wanted to know. At this point of course, grave desecration is all conjectural. However, what we do know is the church today takes grave desecration very seriously indeed, so determining whether this actually took place is a significant question. A GPR survey has uncovered the eastern end of the medieval abbey church beneath what is now a Ministry of Justice car park. (Credit Philippa Langley) Q: What happens next? How do we go about determining a possible connection to Henry I? Is an excavation likely to take place at some point in the future? A: Digging work is due to begin in the car park in the autumn. The Ministry of Justice had previously received permission from Historic England to dig two trenches in the car park based on a Desk Based Assessment (DBA). However, with the Hidden Abbey Project now supplying the GPR analysis and locating the entire east end of the abbey church in the car park at its southern end, the archaeologists and Historic England are now in a position to plan targeted trenches in order to answer the project s (and Reading s) many key research questions. And uncovering the east end of the abbey church will be the basis to unlocking its story. As to a possible connection to Henry, if we uncover the high altar we will then be able to extrapolate the likely location of the king s grave. And by bringing his story to life in the documentary, Henry I will no longer be our forgotten king. If Henry s grave is discovered, it will then be for Reading Council, the landowner [the Ministry of Justice or Diocese of Portsmouth] and Historic England to decide what happens next. Q: What is your reaction to the discovery? A: I m very excited for Reading. The discovery of the east end of the abbey church beneath the car park is an important moment for the town s history, giving them the opportunity to answer so many of the project s key research questions. Telling the abbey s story is going to be incredibly important for Reading, enabling it to become, what I believe it should have always been   a historic town. Q: What parallels can be drawn with the 2012/13 search for the remains of Richard III in Leicester? A: There are some interesting parallels with the search for Richard III in Leicester. Clearly we have the graves of two kings of England becoming lost over time, and two modern locations being a car park and adjacent school. And we also have stories about grave desecration. Before the Looking For Richard Project began its research, it was widely believed (and stated as fact by many leading historians as well as locally in Leicester) that Richard s remains had been removed at the time of the dissolution and thrown in the river Soar. However, what we must also take into account is that unlike Leicester, Reading Abbey is a Scheduled Ancient Monument site under the auspices of Historic England. So far, Historic England has made it clear that it is focused on the site coming off its endangered list and, at the highest level, has recognised what the Hidden Abbey Project can do for Reading. With the GPR survey results now submitted, and in fully supporting Reading by giving it the opportunity to reveal its extraordinary story in full for the first time by placing clearly defined and targeted trenches in the car park, Historic England is on the cusp of offering this Thames Valley town, and its people, an exciting new future.

        "title": "Did Eustace Chapuys really despise Anne Boleyn?",
        "content": "Considering the ambassador s many reports, which have been instrumental in shaping modern interpretations of Henry VIII and his wives, historian Lauren Mackay reevaluates what we think we know about one of the most controversial figures at the Tudor court. Ad Mackay reveals how, rather than celebrating Anne Boleyn's downfall, as is often believed, Chapuys in fact publicly declared in 1536 that she was innocent of the charges brought against her. Here, writing for HistoryExtra, Mackay considers why Chapuys  presence in Anne Boleyn s life has been given a more sinister aspect than it deserves   Full of vexation come I, with complaint . So declares Hermia s father in Shakespeare s A Midsummer Night s Dream. It is the cry of the historian too when certain historical figures are, in our view, consistently misrepresented. Our passions are ignited and we make ready to defend. History has certainly judged the players in Henry VIII s court, particularly its queens, which it enjoyed to excess. Like a good piece of theatre, every character engages our interest, and like any masterly drama, there are victims and villains. Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII s second wife, may claim both titles as she continues to provoke debate as to her role in the compelling drama that witnessed her glorious rise and her calamitous fall. So too does Eustace Chapuys, whose chronicles over 15 years as Charles V s imperial ambassador give us much of the colour and detail of the period. Anne Boleyn was the woman Henry just had to have. His determination would wreak discord in his kingdom and for her he would forsake a wife and a daughter, resulting in much heartache and, for some, death. In the royal courts of Europe Anne was branded a concubine or whore, and was  the scandal of Christendom,  according to Catherine of Aragon. But the supremely confident and obsessed Henry would wed Anne and make her his queen   all she had to do was to fulfill her end of the bargain: bear Henry a son. Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of King Henry VIII, who branded Anne Boleyn  the scandal of Christendom,  c1509. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Anne ultimately failed, and within three years of marriage Henry would sign her death warrant. Almost 500 years later we are still trying to untangle events and understand who engineered her fall. Historians keenly debate the political machinations and the many conspiracy theories pointing to who would most benefit from Anne s downfall. Certainly Henry was the greatest beneficiary. The swaggering, supremely brash monarch, who had spent so many years hotly pursuing his new love interest, is therefore a prime suspect. But in his defence, some historians plead temporary insanity   after all, Henry had been unconscious for more than two hours as a result of a head injury he sustained during a jousting accident in January 1536. Based on today s scientific evidence of concussion, this may have contributed to a swing in his character from devoted husband to a jealous, suspicious and dangerously erratic monarch. Or perhaps the answer was much more mundane. His love and forbearance for his second wife (and her tantrums) had waned over the seven years Anne had been his mistress and queen and Henry wanted out. If Henry was  over  Anne, then perhaps it was his chief schemer and chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, who could turn Anne s vulnerable position to his and Henry s advantage. A man obsessed Cromwell s involvement in Anne s downfall became an obsession for one man, imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys, but not for the reasons we might expect. Chapuys only actually met Anne once [in April 1535], but Anne fascinated the ambassador, whose reports have given us some of the most enduring and emotional scenes of her remarkable yet short reign. But Chapuys  presence in Anne s life has been given a more sinister aspect than it deserves. If we are to believe popular 18th-century historians, Chapuys was a gossip who loathed Anne and worked tirelessly to destroy her and even celebrated her death. If you believe such gossip, then this play would have its villain. But this wasn t the case. Countless letters and reports flew around and across Europe between ambassadors and monarchs, detailing Anne s very public affair with Henry. Chapuys was perhaps the most prolific of these writers. He reported to his employer, Charles V, as well as his confidantes, Mary of Hungary, governess of the Lowlands, and other diplomatic colleagues, sometimes two or three times a day. It may be surprising to learn, however, that some of the most vitriolic reports about Anne s appearance and scandalous behaviour were not written by Chapuys, but by French, Venetian and Spanish embassies. Judging from these reports, Anne was a favourite target of rumour-mongering and was generally most harshly judged by the English people and throughout Europe. But perhaps it is an anonymous, unsigned report found among imperial documents and erroneously attributed to Chapuys (who always signed his letters) that has done the most damage. Referring to Anne s coronation in 1533, the writer said:  The crown became her very ill, and a wart disfigured her very much. She wore a violet velvet mantle, with a high ruff (goulgiel) of gold thread and pearls, which concealed a swelling she has, resembling gotre (sic) . It is a harsh report to be sure, but they were not Chapuys  words. Portrait of Charles V of Spain, 1605. Found in the collection of Museo del Prado, Madrid. Artist Pantoja de la Cruz, Ju n. (Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Other historians keen to devalue Chapuys  reports claim that he was so displeased by Anne s coronation that he sulked in his lodgings, refusing to be a witness to the events. On the contrary, Chapuys  reports are brimming with details of such an historic event, clearly placing him in the middle of the four days of festivities. His only criticisms of the coronation were his observation that Londoners took little joy in the event, but he seems to have revelled in the fabulous spectacle on the Thames that teemed with a pageant of colourfully decorated vessels, as he was lavishly entertained at a banquet held on the German ambassador s barge at the very heart of celebrations.  The Concubine  One of the most prevalent fictions, and certainly one that has most tarnished Chapuys  reputation, concerns his references to Anne in his despatches. It has become an accepted fact that throughout his embassy, Chapuys  titles of choice for Anne were  la Putain  and  the Concubine . Another term,  the Lady , has also been interpreted as disparaging, although Chapuys regularly uses this for other women at court also. All this adds to the drama, but it is much overstated. Chapuys arrived at court in 1529, but he first refers to Anne as  the concubine  in one heated letter in 1533, and then not again until 1535, through to her execution. Most of his letters refer to her as  the Lady  or  Lady Anne ,  the new Marchioness  and so on. He certainly never called her queen. It is true that Chapuys did occasionally refer to Anne s daughter, Elizabeth, as  the little bastard , but more often it was simply  the king s daughter , or  other daughter . Why, then, is the view that Chapuys only used pejorative terms for Anne and Elizabeth so entrenched? The answer is likely a case of mistaken identity. While Chapuys abstained from insults (for the most part), Pedro Ortiz, Catherine of Aragon s proctor in Rome and one of her passionate defenders, wrote quite vitriolic reports about Anne to Chapuys and Charles. In most of his letters Ortiz referred to Anne as  the concubine , and did so as early as 1531 [Catherine and Henry divorced in 1533 and Henry married Anne that same year]. The pejorative descriptions of Anne belong more to Ortiz but have become attached to Chapuys; in my view the two characters have become confused. Charles V (nephew to Queen Catherine) also referred to Anne in a disparaging manner, and many of his imperial ambassadors were guided by his choice of words. The fiction that Chapuys was blinded by his hatred of Anne has allowed historians to dismiss him as gossipy and overly dramatic. Yet by reporting every detail, however immaterial, Chapuys was simply doing his duty. Far from believing all information passed to him, especially when it related to a perceived rift between Henry and Anne, Chapuys often cautioned that the intelligence might be questionable. It is important to remember that although Chapuys only actually met Anne once, he more than anyone managed to capture in his writing Anne s character: her moods, insecurities and increasing impatience, but also her moments of triumph. And by Easter 1536, Anne no doubt felt triumphant. Her rival, Catherine of Aragon, had died in January, signifying that Anne Boleyn was at last the undisputed queen. The irony was that she was now more vulnerable than ever: Henry s affection had waned and he was hotly pursuing Anne s lady-in-waiting, Jane Seymour. Politically Anne was a liability. Catherine had at least brought the Holy Roman Empire to the table, through her nephew Charles V. Anne had sought a French alliance through her connection with Francis I and his court, but France was an unreliable ally. By 1535/36 Thomas Cromwell may have begun to reconsider Anne s use. Such vulnerability would lead to an unprecedented event on 18 April 1535, just after Easter, when Anne and Eustace Chapuys came face-to-face for the first time. The event was certainly significant, but it has been long been misunderstood. So what really occurred between queen and ambassador? Jane Seymour, who by 1536 was being pursued by Henry VIII. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) An unrecognised queen Charles had not yet acknowledged Anne, and thus Chapuys, Charles s representative at the Tudor court, could not acknowledge her either. Yet according to his Easter report Chapuys seems to have been anticipating a meeting. He seemed resigned to the fact that with the prospect of peace in the air he would at some point have to acknowledge Anne as Henry s wife and queen. But there was more to it than that. Anne had also refused to officially acknowledge Charles or his ambassador, but was now aware of the necessity of an imperial alliance. She would have to acknowledge Charles, and that meant acknowledging Chapuys. Peace was at the forefront of Chapuys  mind when he approached Henry after Easter with letters from Charles to Henry. Both Chapuys and Thomas Cromwell had been working together for several months to engineer a rapprochement between both monarchs in a bid to heal the rift caused by Henry s divorce. With Catherine of Aragon gone, Charles was willing to acknowledge Anne, accept the marriage at long last and work towards peace. But nothing was set in stone. Before mass, Cromwell privately asked if Chapuys would consider meeting Anne, but Chapuys could make no such move before any treaty had been signed. He reported that  Before the King went out to mass Cromwell came to me on his part to ask if I would not go and visit and kiss the Concubine. I thought  such a visit would not be advisable, and I begged Cromwell to excuse it, and dissuade the said visit.  Throughout his embassy Chapuys remained on good terms with the Boleyn men. Several of his reports to Charles mention private dinners with Thomas and George, Anne s father and brother, and he thought nothing of meeting with George on this particular morning before Mass. He did, however, note that George seemed overly enthusiastic, making a show of speaking with the ambassador for the benefit of the court. This rather ostentatious display of friendship put Chapuys on his guard as George accompanied him to Mass. He reported that  I was conducted to the Chapel by Lord Rochefort, the concubine s brother, and when the offering came a great many people flocked round the King, out of curiosity, and wishing no doubt to know what sort of a mien the concubine and I should put on.  The entire court seems to have been eagerly waiting. What occurred is considered to be one of the most dramatic and significant events of Anne s last months. If we believe that Chapuys is the villain of the piece, this event can be construed as Anne s last triumph over Charles, making Chapuys look foolish. This would certainly make for a good story. But what Chapuys actually recounts to Charles differs significantly from the more popular version, namely that Chapuys was manipulated and  tricked  into acknowledging Anne. In his original report, Chapuys makes it quite clear that George stood beside him and he, Chapuys, did not object to being moved to where the royal couple would pass. Henry and Anne descended from the royal chapel and made their way to the altar. Chapuys wrote:  I must say that she was affable enough on the occasion for on my being placed behind the door by which she entered the chapel, she turned round to return the reverence which I made her when she passed.  Popular history tells us that Anne stopped in front of Chapuys, who was then forced to bow, to the delight of both Henry and Anne. But we must bear in mind that Chapuys says he was already bowing as the royal couple passed; it was Anne who turned and acknowledged Chapuys  show of respect. Chapuys was demonstrating that he was willing to make this small accession, and Anne was formally acknowledging and paying respect to Charles V, through his ambassador. This was momentous for both sides. We tend to focus on the significance of the event for Anne, but we must acknowledge that this was equally significant for Charles. It has been suggested that the king and Cromwell had engineered the event to send a signal to Charles that Henry could not be manipulated into a rapprochement, yet this is highly unlikely, as Charles was already willing to accept Anne as part of an alliance. Anne was in a weak position and it was a shrewd political move to acknowledge Charles through the ambassador. Her actions after mass are even more intriguing. Chapuys dined with George and Thomas Boleyn, along with other councilors, but Anne also expressed a desire to dine with Chapuys. Anne then attempted to ingratiate herself further with Charles by publicly abusing the French ambassador (which Chapuys himself often did in private), who was sure to report the incident. Anne had switched tactics, but it would not save her. Heartfelt admiration Chapuys  final description of Anne is testimony to the sort of woman she was. Beyond the divorce drama, the jealous squabbles and the treatment of Catherine and Henry's daughter Mary, Anne was, in Chapuys  eyes, innocent of the charges brought against her. His words are heartfelt in their admiration:  No one ever shewed more courage or greater readiness to meet death than she did, having, as the report goes, begged and solicited those under whose keeping she was to hasten the execution. When orders came from the King to have it [the execution] delayed until to-day, she seemed sorry, and begged and entreated the governor of the Tower for God s sake, to go to the King, and beg of him that, since she was well disposed and prepared for death, she should be despatched immediately .

(Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images) Since her execution almost 500 years ago, Anne s story continues to resonate with us, as it did with Chapuys. Whatever he felt about Anne s position he nevertheless admired her intelligence and political acumen. Anne s allies abandoned her during her trial, and the court, which had once admired and served the queen, stayed silent. But Chapuys could not. In fact, he was one of the very few who publicly declared that she was innocent and a victim of a political coup. Anne s execution haunted the ambassador. As he wrote to Charles:  The executioner s sword and her own death were virtually to separate and divorce man and wife. However, if such was their intention it strikes me that it would have been a far more decent and honest excuse to allege that she had been married to another man still alive . Chapuys also wrote,  May God permit that this may be his [Henry s] last folly.  We know it would not be. Regardless of Chapuys  personal feelings towards Anne, his admiration and respect for one of the most alluring women of Henry s court, when all others voiced their condemnation, is a fascinating element of the ambassador s life. His relationship with her, gleaned from his countless reports, gives the impression of two individuals who endured a complex relationship, despite having only ever once come face-to-face. Chapuys  reports and despatches have often been twisted to suit some dramatic purpose. Those who questioned the ambassador s character and integrity as a source might be influenced by Anne s idolisation as the aggrieved queen. We continue to focus on potential culprits behind Anne s downfall but, centuries later, the truth remains tantalisingly out of reach.

        "title": "A brief history of Offa s Dyke",
        "content": "Now, a new book written by two archaeologists who have been studying the Dyke for the past 15 years explores the specifically Mercian and English context for its creation. In Offa s Dyke: Landscape & Hegemony in Eighth-Century Britain, Keith Ray and Ian Bapty explore how the Dyke may have been built and what it achieved, and consider what can be learned from it. Ad Here, writing for History Extra, Keith Ray explores the history of Offa s Dyke  What makes a simple earth ditch-and-bank dug along the frontier between Wales and England 1,200 years ago potentially fascinating to any historically-minded person living in Britain in the 21st-century? For one thing, its length: the earthwork itself covers a distance of more than 80 miles (129km) and it ranges across a former frontier that spanned 115 miles (185km)   the latter extending from the shores of the Dee estuary in the north to Severn Estuary near Chepstow in the south. As such, this  great work , built at the command of Offa of Mercia, one of the most remarkable kings to have ruled much of Anglo-Saxon England, is Britain s (and arguably Europe s) longest ancient earthwork. Another remarkable thing about Offa s Dyke is the way in which so much of it has survived: a long-distance trail, the Offa s Dyke Path, follows much of its course, especially in the historic counties of Gloucestershire, Radnorshire, Shropshire and Montgomeryshire. It is, however, the context of Offa s Dyke s building that provides most relevance to life today, because there are some remarkable similarities between events in the world of late eighth-century England and today s Europe: warfare at the peripheries of the continent, mass-migration and, above all, Britain s relationship with Europe were matters of considerable concern as the expansionary Kingdom of Mercia was trying to dominate all the other kingdoms and peoples of England (and especially the remaining powers of Northumbria, East Anglia, Kent and Wessex) during the reigns of Offa (757 796) and Coenwulf (796 821). At the same time, this  Mercian regime  was trying to annexe territories of the Britons of Wales and was seeking to rival the continental empire of Charlemagne, the charismatic leader of the Kingdom of the Franks, crowned by the Pope (in 800) as Holy Roman Emperor. Silver penny of Offa, King of Mercia. 8th century. (Fitzwilliam Museum, University of Cambridge/Bridgeman Images) The supremacy of Mercia within late eighth and early ninth-century-England was reinforced by many means, including (alongside military muscle),strategic marriage-alliances, control over the Church, assassination, new forms of taxation and new duties of military service. Among those duties was one to perform  bridge-work and fortress-work , and this was probably the mechanism whereby a large work force was assembled to do the necessary aligning, quarrying, ditch-digging, soil and turf and stone mounding. This was carried out across a terrain replete with high moorland, steep-sided valleys, river-crossings and hilltops along what has become the borderland between England and Wales. So why was the Dyke built? Firstly, it served as a deterrent: it demonstrated the might of Mercian mobilisation   any kingdom with the resources to create such a massive work could surely crush any would-be invaders. Secondly, the Dyke bolstered Mercia s standing as a European power. This monumental act of building also boasted clear resonances back to the works of Roman emperors. Both Offa and Coenwulf seemingly used the Dyke as a base for carrying out military expeditions right across Wales, and the way in which the Dyke traverses the landscape resonates closely with Roman frontier works   Hadrian s Wall in particular. Offa and Coenwulf did not see themselves as  kings of the English , however, as some past Anglo-Saxon historians have suggested. They saw themselves, rather, as  emperors of Mercia . The manifest destiny of the latter kingdom was, in their world-view, to absorb all the English into Mercia (and that is possibly why the Mercians sought to build no such  barrier  between themselves and either Northumbria or Wessex, the compliance of both of which kingdoms in Mercian dominion was achieved in part through marriages of their kings with two of Offa s daughters). But how much do we really know about Offa s Dyke? There are lots of reasons to attribute the building of the Dyke to King Offa, including a direct reference to the then 100-year-old structure by King Alfred of Wessex s biographer, Asser (in a passage of his Life of King Alfred). However, the details of its construction are much more difficult to establish, as several archaeologists have discovered. It is still uncertain whether the Dyke was built in one go or whether its course linked up a series of pre-existing barriers built across ridge-top routes and river-valley trackways. It is also hard to date the Dyke accurately, due to the difficulty in finding material incorporated within or under it that belongs exactly to the period of its construction. The Dyke clearly post-dates Roman period settlements, because these have been found sealed beneath it. However, turf incorporated within its bank may also pre-date it by some time, and the activities of burrowing animals over the centuries may have introduced material that considerably post-dates its creation. At a recent excavation at Plas Offa near Chirk, for example, one radiocarbon date from turf redeposited within its bank suggested a possible origin as early as the fifth century AD, while a few metres away another sample from the base of the bank indicated a possible ninth-century date. Considerable investment of resources would be required to produce more precise dating. What is clear from even a limited re-study of the form of the Offa s Dyke earthwork and its positioning within the landscape is that it was a more complex construction than has previously been suggested. It builders deployed, for instance, careful scarping of natural slopes incorporated within it at several places, and careful adjustment of individual short lengths or segments along its course, to make it look bigger than it actually was. In this way the Dyke was designed to impress: not only by its huge span, but also in how it was to be seen from the west, dominating the landscape. Besides being built to impress, the Dyke was also designed to exclude the Welsh from their former lands and was probably used as a means to raise revenue by customs control and to monitor what was going on in the area immediately to its west. Indeed, the Dyke was positioned to overlook approaches from that direction   surveillance was as important then as it is today. Offa's Dyke on Llanfair Hill north of Knighton, Powys. (Photo by David Jones/PA) The landscape the Dyke crossed was part of an evolving frontier that needs to be seen in the context of the development of  march-lands  dividing off emergent states of the period from the surrounding peoples. This was exactly what the Franks were doing in continental Europe with the creation of the frontiers of the emergent  Carolingian Empire , replete with customs-points. The location of particularly complex stretches of the Dyke may correspond to notably sensitive  political places  along the frontier where centres of Welsh power, such as may have existed on the later sites of Powis and Montgomery castles, may have been confronted by the earthwork. This frontier, of which the Dyke formed the key   but not the only   component, may also have been made to work by creating  hybrid  groups along its length. As such, mechanisms for creating and sustaining a Mercian version of what in medieval times became part of the  Welsh marches  probably also included the formation of new frontier administrative units in which Welsh and English communities lived side-by-side under Mercian control. In c895 AD Bishop Asser, with the benefit of hindsight and in the setting of Alfred s newly-ascendant West Saxon kingdom in the late ninth-century, saw Offa s Dyke fundamentally as a vainglorious exercise by an unscrupulous and ruthless king. While this was no doubt true (within 50 years of Coenwulf s death the Danes had sliced Mercia in two and had all but crushed Wessex in military victories), we can alternatively see the Dyke as a measure of how  Mercian Britain  could envisage a future relationship with Europe on as near-equal terms as has ever been achieved since then. By laying down the origins of conscripted armies; economic power through trade and a regulated currency; a court culture in which queens as well as kings held sway; and the first formal  diplomatic missions  (such as the one in 789 that failed to successfully negotiate an alliance between the dominant power of Europe   Francia   and Mercia), Offa s kingdom provided a first glimpse of the role a newly-assertive Britain could play in a wider international setting. And it involved the attempt to forge a  new relationship  with Europe that is arguably just as elusive today as it was all those centuries ago.

        "content": "Royal status brings with it privilege and power   but also danger, particularly the risk of assassination by those craving that power. From the Norman conquest to Charles s execution in 1649, many British men, women and children of royal blood died in extraordinary circumstances. Deaths early in that period were often shrouded in mystery, but by the 17th century circumstances had changed to an extraordinary extent   for the first time an executioner severed the head of a king of England: Charles I, condemned by his own people  Ad William II meets his fate in the forest On 2 August 1100 King William II, third son of William the Conqueror, was hunting in the New Forest. The chronicler William of Malmesbury reported that after dinner the king, nicknamed  Rufus , went into the forest  attended by few persons , notably a gentleman named Walter Tirel. While most of the king s party  employed in the chase, were dispersed as chance directed,  Tirel remained with the king. As the sun began to set, William spotted a stag and  drawing his bow and letting fly an arrow, slightly wounded  it. In his excitement the king began to run towards the injured target, and at that point Tirel,  conceiving a noble exploit  in that the king s attention was occupied elsewhere,  pierced his breast with a fatal arrow . William fell to the ground and Tirel, seeing that the king was dead, immediately  leaped swiftly upon his horse, and escaped by spurring him to his utmost speed . Upon discovering William s body, the rest of his party fled and, in an attempt to protect their own interests, readied themselves to declare their allegiance to the next king. It was left to a few countrymen to convey the dead king s corpse to Winchester Cathedral by cart,  the blood dripping from it all the way . Was William s death an accident, or was it murder? An accident was possible, but there were many who believed otherwise. William s younger brother immediately assumed the throne and swiftly had himself crowned Henry I. Henry had much to gain from his brother s death, and Tirel may have been in his employ. William had, however, been an unpopular king, and his death was  lamented by few .

(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The Lionheart and eyeless Art Almost 100 years later, Henry I s great-grandson, Richard the Lionheart, also met a violent end at the point of an arrow, but in very different circumstances. Richard had spent the majority of his 10-year reign fighting abroad on crusade; he was a brave solider who inspired loyalty in his men. In 1199, while he was besieging the Ch teau de Ch lus-Chabrol, a crossbow bolt struck him in the shoulder. Though the shot did not kill him, it penetrated deep into his body. Though removal of the bolt by a surgeon was a painful ordeal, Richard survived   but before long the wound became infected and gangrene set in. It became clear that the king s days were numbered, and on 6 April, 11 days after he was shot,  the man devoted to martial deeds, breathed his last.  Richard was succeeded by his younger brother, John. However, though John was accepted as king of England he had a rival for his French lands: Arthur of Brittany, son of John s brother, Geoffrey, who had died over a decade earlier. In 1202, John s forces captured Arthur at Mirebeau, where the latter had been attempting to besiege the castle in which his grandmother (John s mother), Eleanor of Aquitaine, was sheltering. Arthur was taken to Falaise, where   it was later claimed   John gave orders for his 16-year-old nephew to be  deprived of his eyes and genitals , but the jailer refused to obey such a cruel command. Shortly afterwards, the boy was moved to Rouen where, on the evening of 3 April 1203, it seems that John himself,  drunk with wine and possessed of the Devil , killed Arthur personally. The young boy s lifeless body was reputedly weighed down with a heavy stone and thrown into the river Seine. In the two centuries after the murder of Arthur of Brittany, both Edward II and Richard II were deposed. The latter was almost certainly starved to death in Pontefract Castle, but controversy still surrounds the end of Edward II   he may have been murdered in Berkeley Castle, but several modern historians are of the opinion that he escaped abroad. Richard I, aka  Richard the Lionheart , depicted plunging his fist into a lion's throat, c1180. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The bloody Wars of the Roses In the middle of the 15th century, the Wars of the Roses broke out, causing a profusion of bloodshed that did not exclude royal or noble families. After a struggle that saw the Lancastrian King Henry VI deposed in favour of the Yorkist Edward IV, and a brief period of restoration for Henry VI (commonly referred to as the readeption), on 4 May 1471 the armies of Lancaster and York met at Tewkesbury, where Edward IV won  a famous victory . It was a fierce battle during which around 2,000 Lancastrians were slain, and the battlefield is still referred to as  Bloody Meadow.  For Henry s son and heir, the 18-year-old Prince Edward of Lancaster, Tewkesbury had been his first experience of war, and one that he would not survive. Reports of the precise manner of the prince s death vary: most sources state that the he was killed in the field, whereas the Yorkist author of the Arrivall of Edward IV, who claimed to be a servant of Edward IV s and a witness to many of the events about which he wrote, asserts that Edward  was taken fleeing to the townwards, and slain in the field . Later Tudor historians, however, implied that the prince had been murdered  by the avenging hands of certain persons,  on the orders of Edward IV. Whatever the circumstances, the Lancastrian heir had been removed; now all that remained was for his father to be eliminated. While the battle of Tewkesbury raged, Henry VI was a prisoner in the Tower of London. Following his victory, Edward IV travelled to London in triumph, arriving on 21 May. That same evening, Henry VI was reportedly praying in his oratory within the Wakefield Tower when he  was put to death . Though the author of the Arrivall stated that Henry died of  pure displeasure and melancholy  as a result of being told of the death of his son, there is little doubt that he died violently. The examination of his skull in 1911 revealed that to one piece  there was still attached some of the hair, which was brown in colour, save in one place, where it was much darker and apparently matted with blood,  consistent with a blow to the head. Many believed that Henry had been murdered at the hands of the king s brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, but though Richard may have been present, the order undoubtedly came from Edward IV. Henry VI , c1450. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The slaughter also extended to Edward s own family. The relationship Edward shared with his younger brother George, Duke of Clarence, was tumultuous, to say the least. After several estrangements and reconciliations, in 1477 Clarence finally went too far. Convinced that his brother was conspiring against him, Edward had Clarence arrested; at the beginning of February 1478, he was tried and condemned to death. On 18 February Clarence was executed within the confines of the Tower of London. According to several contemporary sources, at his own request the duke was drowned after being  plunged into a jar of sweet wine  in the Bowyer Tower. Clarence s daughter, Margaret Pole, was later painted wearing a bracelet with a barrel charm, which appears to support this story. The duke s death orphaned both Margaret and her younger brother Edward, Earl of Warwick. Like their father, both would meet violent ends. The princes in the Tower Edward IV died unexpectedly on 9 April 1483, leaving as successor his 12-year-old son, also Edward, at that time staying at Ludlow Castle. After his father s death, the young Prince Edward set out for London but was intercepted en route by his uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who lodged Edward and his brother Prince Richard in the Tower of London. Having been declared illegitimate, on 26 June Edward was deposed in favour of his uncle, who took the throne as Richard III. Rumours about the fate of the  princes in the Tower  soon began to circulate. Many believe that they were murdered  lying in their beds  on the orders of Richard III, and the skeletons of two youths discovered in the Tower in 1674 seems to support this theory. Some, however, insist that the boys did not die in the Tower but managed to escape. Though their ultimate fate is still obscure, one thing is certain: after the coronation of Richard III on 6 July, neither boy was seen alive again.

From the Connoisseur VOL XXVII, 1910. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Richard III did not hold his throne for long. In 1485 his army was confronted by the forces of the Lancastrian Henry Tudor at Bosworth in Leicestershire. Richard fought bravely in his attempt to defend his crown, but was  pierced with many mortal wounds , and became the last king of England to be killed on the battlefield. Thanks to the discovery of his skeleton in Leicester, we now know that a blow to the head killed Richard, and that his body was subjected to a number of  humiliation  wounds after his death. Richard s successor, Henry VII, ordered the execution of the Duke of Clarence s son, the Earl of Warwick, beheaded In 1499 for conspiring with the pretender Perkin Warbeck to overthrow the king. Warwick s sister, Margaret Pole, was executed in 1541 by command of Henry VIII on charges of treason. In her late sixties and condemned on evidence that was almost certainly falsified, Margaret s death shocked her contemporaries, one of whom observed that her execution was conducted by  a wretched and blundering youth  who  literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner  so that she bled to death. Henry VIII s wives Henry VIII also notoriously executed two of his wives. Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were both condemned on charges of adultery, treason, and, in Anne s case, incest with her own brother. Anne was almost certainly innocent of the crimes of which she was accused; nevertheless, on the morning of 19 May 1536 she became the first queen of England to be executed. Although her death within the confines of the Tower of London was intended to be a private affair, conducted away from the eyes of curious Londoners, around 1,000 people watched as her head was struck from her body with one strike of a French executioner s sword. In 1554 Lady Jane Grey also met her fate at the headsman s axe. So, too, did Mary, Queen of Scots, executed in February 1587 on the orders of Elizabeth I. The first queen regnant to be beheaded, Mary was decapitated at Fotheringhay Castle in a bloody scene: it took three strokes of the axe to remove her head.

(Photo by Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images) Mary s grandson was to suffer a similar ignominious end the following century. Having been defeated in the Civil War, in January 1649 Charles I became the first English monarch to be tried and condemned for treason   there was no precedent for the lawful killing of a king. On the date of his execution, 30 January, Charles stepped out of Banqueting House in Whitehall on to a public scaffold. His head was removed amid a great groan from the crowd, and it was observed that many of those who attended dipped their handkerchiefs in the late king s blood as a memento. Charles s death signalled the abolition of the monarchy, and the establishment of a republic in England. In a public display of contempt for the monarchy, he became the only king of England to be murdered by his subjects. It was a far cry from the dark and mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of William  Rufus  and those other ill-fated royals who came before. Nicola Tallis is a British historian and author.

        "title": "The real history behind Victoria series two",
        "content": "Series one of ITV's Victoria introduced a new TV audience to the early years of the monarch's reign, tracing her remarkable story from a teenage royal sleeping in the same bedroom as her mother to one of the most powerful women in the world. While much of the first series focused on the growing relationship between the queen and her beloved Albert, series two sees the diminutive monarch become a mother, having to balance a new maternal role with her position at the head of a vast empire. As a new series begins, HistoryExtra spoke to series writer Daisy Goodwin about what the 1840s held in store for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert  Ad Q: This series takes us into a new decade, the 1840s. Where do we pick up the story in season two and what did these next few years hold for Victoria and Albert? A: We pick up a few weeks after the birth of the Princess Royal, and Victoria is going through  confinement . In those days, aristocratic women stayed in bed after the birth of their baby and had up to six weeks of bed rest. I discovered that, during this time, the queen was taken everywhere in a Bath chair [a wheeled carriage for one person]. I thought that Victoria might get a bit bored by all that; she s only 21. I imagined that she would spring  back to life , only to discover (as some people might when coming back from maternity leave) that life has gone on without her. I think all of that comes as a bit of a shock to her. Victoria has a lot of children in the 1840s. She s pregnant pretty much all the time, so that s a challenge for her and for Prince Albert. It s also an incredibly important political period; it was called the  hungry forties . We see the birth of the Chartist movement [which campaigned for the rights of working people]. It was a time of incredible political unrest, which was seen in the reform of the Corn Laws [regulations which governed the import and export of grain], which were as seismic then as Brexit is now. There s a disastrous Irish famine after the potato crop failed in successive years. There s also threat of a war with France. As this is all going on, Victoria and Albert are trying to negotiate their lives as parents and as a couple, and they have a very volatile marriage. They re devoted to each other, but there s a power struggle, and I think it s a power struggle that a lot of people will recognise. It s a time of personal and political ferment. Series two sees Victoria and Albert adjusting to their new roles as parents in the turbulent 1840s. (  Mammoth Screen for ITV) Q: A key theme in the new series is how Victoria struggled with motherhood. Can you tell how this was viewed at the time and what s your interpretation of this in 2017? A: In 2017, I think we rather sentimentalise motherhood; we have far fewer children, so we want to capture every moment. We almost fetishise it. What s interesting about Victoria is that she is a reluctant mother; she s got no access to contraception so she has no choice. I think she s not happy about the  invasion  of her body by pregnancy. She called it the  shadow side of her marriage . She loves her children and she s clearly very attached to them, but she doesn t coo over babies. At one point, she says:  all babies look like frogs to me.  In many ways, she s still a child who didn t get enough love herself, and perhaps that affects the way she views her own children. After the birth of her second child,  Bertie  (the Prince of Wales who would become Edward VII), she almost certainly had what we would now call postnatal depression. This obviously wasn t recognised at the time, as back then women were considered to be odd creatures prone to many  strange emotions . It was very difficult for her to deal with the feelings she had after the birth of Bertie. She didn t write in her diary for a while and I think that was very unlike her. Having suffered from postnatal depression myself, I know that she would have been affected by something you can t really deal with or understand. For Queen Victoria, this must have been very difficult indeed, to be a queen and also to be in the grip of this mental illness. She came through it and she had nine children, but it must have taken a terrific toll on her both physically and mentally. Yet she battled on, which I think is pretty impressive. Queen Victoria had nine babies over 17 years, a tremendous physical feat. (  Mammoth Screen for ITV) Q: How might we see Victoria s relationship with Albert changing now that they re parents? Has some of the romance that we saw in series one worn off? A: There was a very strong bond between them. In this series, we see how their relationship evolved and matured, though it was still based on terrific attraction. However, underpinning it all was this slightly difficult question for them of who s the more powerful figure in the relationship. He was the husband and the  master , while she was the wife and the queen. As a 19th-century couple, it was very difficult for them to negotiate who s really in charge. She tried very hard to make him think that he was the boss, though ultimately, she was the one with the money and the power. We know that she very much enjoyed her sex life, though the fact that she enjoyed it so much meant that she was always pregnant! Q: You ve shared how you draw heavily on Victoria s own diaries when shaping the series. Can you tell us a little bit about the diaries and the details you uncovered in them? A: She was a prolific diarist: she wrote almost every day, writing 62 million words! Most of the diaries we have today were censored by her daughter Beatrice for publication, but there s one section that seems to have been passed by. In this section, Victoria writes very candidly about the trials and tribulations of being a mother, about how she loathes her own mother, and she s very frank about her sex life with Albert. Not explicit things, but she writes about evenings being the  best night of her life , or  last night was awful, no fun . It s pretty clear what s going on; there s a funny line I found where she describes how wonderful Albert looks in his  white, cashmere britches  with nothing on underneath! She s very frank about her admiration for the male form, which I think is rather charming. I think she always knew that these diaries would be seen. While she was writing for posterity, she also knew that her mother might read them, that her governess might read them   later she thought that Albert would be reading them, so they weren t entirely frank. I think they were slightly disingenuous in parts; there were times when she knew that they were being read and there were other moments when she was writing for herself. She probably knew that at some point they would have been read by the nation. She was certainly the first monarch to publish a bestselling book based on her journals: Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands (1868). Jenna Coleman becomes a mother in series two of 'Victoria', written by Daisy Goodwin. (  Mammoth Screen for ITV) Q: How do you go about balancing historical accuracy and making this series dramatically exciting and suitable for a TV audience? A: It s a drama, not a documentary, and I try and shape events around a dramatic structure. There are some characters I have created a dramatic story for, but Victoria and Albert s stories are pretty close. I do take liberties here and there: for instance, she doesn t have five children in four years on screen, as I felt that might get a little repetitive for viewers! However, we do see the impact of bearing all of these children. In terms of shaping the story, I get to a point where I m steeped in the history and I then I try to distil the most exciting, dramatic and truthful version that I can. Wherever possible, the drama is inspired by real events, whether they are assassination attempts, the repeal of the Corn Laws or the terrible potato famine. All the big building blocks of the series are true. I m not saying that you can watch Victoria and it s your GCSE History Victorians module done, but you d have a pretty good idea of what s going on. I hope that I ve inspired quite a lot of people to go off and find out more about the subjects. I m passionate about people becoming interested in history and pleased that it s been a by-product of this series. Q: Why do you think that this story is still so fascinating for 2017 TV audiences? A: I think people are still very interested in stories of queens; people like seeing what happens when a young woman is given power, as it s so unusual. I suppose that there is something about watching Britain at a time when it s beginning a journey to becoming a great nation. It s full of excitement and discovery. We re surrounded by monuments and reminders of the Victorian era today: the Victoria and Albert museum, our street layouts, statues, stations, railway networks, and sewers. A lot of our infrastructure is still Victorian. It s a time that still fascinates people. There was great success and ingenuity, productivity and confidence; I suppose that helps make this era all the more intriguing. Q: Victoria reigned until she was 81. Can we expect to see the series spanning that far? Ad A: People keep asking me that! It s a great story, though it depends on whether we all have the energy to keep doing it   I d be quite happy to go on, but who knows?",

Creating the Royal Flight was a most innovative action by King Edward VIII, although members of the royal family had enjoyed a passion for flying almost since the dawn of aviation. The first confirmed flight by a member of the Royal Family was when Edward, the Prince of Wales   while on a visit to Villaverta on the Italian Front on 27 September 1918   was invited to fly in the rear cockpit of a Bristol F.2B Fighter with Captain WG Barker of the RAF s Number 139 Squadron. Interestingly, the prince remained standing in the rear cockpit throughout the short flight. Shortly after the end of the First World War, Prince Albert took a flying course at Croydon and was awarded his wings on 31 July 1919. However, it was the Prince of Wales s fervent interest in aviation that led him to purchase his very own de Havilland DH.60G Gipsy Moth in September 1929 and which ultimately led to the formation of the King s Flight. Edward later took flying lessons in the aircraft and soon earned his own wings under the tutelage of one Squadron Leader Don. Later, Edward added two further de Havilland aircraft to his own private collection before the flight was moved to RAF Hendon in late 1930. Shortly after the move, the aircraft were unofficially nicknamed  The Royal Flight  by staff on the airfield, although it would be another six years before the King s Flight would be officially formed. Other Royal Air Force aircraft were allocated to  official  royal duties and the sight of members of the Royal Family travelling by air became commonplace. Over the years, the King s and Queen s Flight have operated an interesting variety of aircraft and helicopters, many of British design and manufacture. Royal visits have provided an excellent opportunity to promote British aviation. One chapter in the book is dedicated the experiences of those who flew members of the royal family during the last years of the Queen s Flight, which was finally disbanded on 31 March 1995 and merged with the RAF s Number 32 (The Royals) Squadron.

        "title": "The real history behind  The White Princess",
        "content": "Adapted from Philippa Gregory s bestselling novel of the same name, The White Princess centres on the marriage of Elizabeth of York and King Henry VII. This union between the rival houses of York and Lancaster was seen to bring peace after the Wars of the Roses, a series of conflicts between 1450 and 1500 that saw England riven by revolts, murderous coups, financial collapse and full-scale battles. Ad However, the series suggests that despite the union between the two houses, personal and political rifts continued to run deep. In the drama, rumours circulate that Elizabeth of York s long-lost brother Prince Richard, son of Edward IV and his queen Elizabeth Woodville, is alive and planning to take the throne.  Lizzie  is forced to choose between her new husband and a boy who could be her own blood and the rightful Yorkist king. The White Princess charts one of the most tumultuous times in British history from the point of view of the women waging the ongoing battle for the English throne. But who were the key players in this story? We explore the real characters behind the series  Elizabeth of York Jodie Comer as Elizabeth of York. (  Starz) The White Princess dramatises  Lizzie s  marriage to the first Tudor king Henry VII, her relationship with her mother the Dowager Queen Elizabeth, and her new mother-in-law, Margaret Beaufort. She may not have sought the limelight as much as some of her contemporaries, but Elizabeth of York was a Tudor of rare talent, writes Alison Weir. Portrayed by Jodie Comer in the series, Elizabeth of York played an important role in the Wars of the Roses and the early Tudor story. Alison Weir:  Born in 1466, Elizabeth was the eldest daughter of the Yorkist king Edward IV, sister of the princes in the Tower, and niece of Richard III, who had her and her siblings declared bastards so that he could claim the throne. The probable murder of her brothers in the Tower of London in 1483 meant that, in the eyes of many, Elizabeth was the rightful queen of England. Richard III himself contemplated marrying her, but in 1485 Henry Tudor, who claimed to be the heir to the House of Lancaster and had sworn to marry Elizabeth, came from France with an army and defeated Richard at the battle of Bosworth. Thus was founded the Tudor dynasty. Elizabeth was intelligent and beautiful. A Venetian report described her as  a very handsome woman of great ability, and in conduct very able,  beloved for her abundant  charity and humanity . The humanist scholar Erasmus described her in one word:  brilliant . That there was affection and tenderness between Henry and Elizabeth cannot be doubted.  Read more here. Margaret Beaufort Michelle Fairley as Margaret Beaufort. (  Starz) She fell pregnant at 12, was widowed by the Wars of the Roses and almost died at the hands of Richard III. But, writes Michael Jones, nothing could prevent the indomitable Margaret Beaufort from engineering the rise of her son, Henry VII, to the English throne. Described by Jones as  truly one of history s great survivors,  the mother of the first Tudor king is played by Game of Thrones' Michelle Fairley in the series, and she has spent her entire adult life setting the stage for her son to become king. Michael Jones:  Margaret s father had died shortly before her first birthday and so she was brought up by her mother, Margaret Beauchamp. Her mother instilled in her a strong sense of personal destiny and family pride. Despite her young age, Margaret was bright and remarkably self-assured. Above all, she was well aware of the opportunities beckoning her. That she would go on to take full advantage of these opportunities is beyond doubt. For, in the face of huge obstacles and sometimes mortal peril, Margaret played the 15th-century game of power-politics with bravery and determination. And, on 22 August 1485, her perseverance was rewarded when her son, Henry Tudor, defeated Richard III at the battle of Bosworth to become king. Charting Margaret s role in Henry s rise to power   and the establishment of the Tudor dynasty   reveals the skill-set of one of the great political survivors of the late Middle Ages.  Read more about Margaret Beaufort, mother of the Tudors Dowager Queen Elizabeth Essie Davis as Dowager Queen Elizabeth. (  Starz) Essie Davis plays the Dowager Queen Elizabeth in the series. Once queen of England, having been married to King Edward IV, we meet Elizabeth Woodville in her later years as the dowager queen, following the premature death of her husband and two sons. The White Princess sees Lizzie's mother plotting continuously to put the House of York back on the throne. Writing on Elizabeth Woodville s earlier years and relationship with Edward IV, late medieval and early Tudor historian Amy Licence says that at five years older than her royal husband, Elizabeth Woodville was an unlikely queen. Amy Licence:  While none could fault her personal charms, Elizabeth was considered an unacceptable choice for an English queen by most of Edward s advisors. She was a widow, a mother already, born and married into Lancastrian families, the daughter of a mere knight, a man whom Edward had formerly held in contempt. She brought no dowry or international connections, no territories or promise of diplomatic support. What she did bring was her fertility, bearing the king 10 children in addition to the two sons from her first husband, Sir John Grey. Elizabeth also brought in a model of queenship that differed vastly from that of the woman she replaced, the Lancastrian Margaret of Anjou. Elizabeth may have begun her reign as unsuitable and unpopular but in fact, she was the perfect embodiment of the beautiful, submissive, fertile queen   an archetype of medieval literature.  Read more about the marriage of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville Henry VII Jacob Collins-Levy as Henry VII. (  Starz) Played by Jacob Collins-Levy in The White Princess, we meet the dashing and handsome Henry VII as he has finally taken the crown for himself, after defeating Richard III at the bloody battle of Bosworth in 1485. The first Tudor monarch may not win many popularity contests, writes Steven Gunn, but the king set the blueprint for a dynasty that was to make England a global power. In the series, he is resentful of the duty that requires having to marry a woman who openly despises him, and is heavily influenced by his powerful mother, Margaret Beaufort. Yet while Elizabeth and Henry s marriage was a politically driven match, there s evidence that  Henry clearly grew to love, trust and respect Elizabeth . Steven Gunn:  Henry VII is the inscrutable Tudor. Less charismatic than Henry VIII or Elizabeth, less tragic than Edward or Mary, he stands no realistic chance in a Most Famous Tudor competition. But that is no reason to forget him. We should admire Henry first for his tenacity. When he was propelled from exile to the English throne in 1485 by the sudden death of Edward IV, Richard III s seizure of the crown and the bloody battle of Bosworth, six of the last nine English kings had been deposed. And the average was getting worse: each of the last four had lost the crown; one of them, the hapless Henry VI, twice. Henry was not just a survivor but a stabiliser. He was less trusting, less generous and less relaxed than many of his subjects might have liked: he is only recorded as laughing in public once.  Read more about the rule of Henry VII Richard III Richard III, image undated. (Photo by Apic/Getty Images) Although he died before the historical events depicted in The White Princess, Richard III still casts a significant shadow over the drama. In her original story, Gregory builds on the speculation that the king was the lover of Elizabeth of York before her marriage to Henry VII, and also suspected of murdering the two sons of the dowager queen. As such, Richard III features heavily in much of the show s action. So, who was the king and how true are the accusations against him? John Ashown Hill:  It has frequently been claimed (on the basis of reports of a letter, the original of which does not survive), that in 1485 Richard III planned to marry his niece, Elizabeth of York, eldest daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. There is no doubt that rumours to this effect were current in 1485, and we know for certain that Richard was concerned about them. That is not surprising, since his invitation to mount the throne had been based upon the conclusion that all of Edward IV s children were bastards. Obviously no logical monarch would have sought to marry a bastard niece. In fact, very clear evidence survives that proves beyond question that Richard did intend to remarry in 1485. However, his chosen bride was the Portuguese princess Joana. What s more, his diplomats in Portugal were also seeking to arrange a second marriage there   between Richard s illegitimate niece, Elizabeth, and a minor member of the Portuguese royal family!  Ad Elsewhere, Ashdown Hill also considers the charge that Richard III murdered the princes in the Tower:  There is no evidence that Edward of Westminster, Henry VI, the  princes in the Tower  or Anne Neville were murdered by anyone. Edward of Westminster was killed at the battle of Tewkesbury, and Anne Neville almost certainly died naturally. Also, if Richard III really had been a serious killer in the interests of his own ambitions, why didn t he kill Lord and Lady Stanley   and John Morton?",

        "title": "lfthryth: England s first queen",
        "content": "This article was first published in the May 2017 edition of BBC History Magazine Ad If asked to name a medieval queen of England, most would probably fasten upon Eleanor of Aquitaine, the influential wife of Henry II, made famous by Katharine Hepburn in The Lion in Winter. A few Plantagenet and Tudor enthusiasts might think of Elizabeth Woodville, the capable consort of Edward IV and grandmother to Henry VIII. One or two of the more adventurous might even fix upon Emma of Normandy, the indomitable wife of King Cnut in the early 11th century. Many would struggle to think of any at all. But very few indeed would name  lfthryth, the third wife of King Edgar (reigned 959 75) and mother of  thelred  the Unready  (r978 1013 and 1014 16). This is understandable. Beyond her outlandish name (sometimes modernised as Elfrida),  lfthryth faces a number of difficulties. For a start, our sources for her life are much scarcer than they are for her more famous successors. To this may be added the lower public profile of Anglo-Saxon history. All too often we think of the Middle Ages as starting in 1066. Before this lurks the mysterious  Dark Ages : a period filled with fascinating, semi-mythical figures such as Arthur and Merlin, but little in the way of real historical evidence. Still, it is a pity that she is not better known, for if any medieval English queen deserves to be a household name, it is  lfthryth. And for all the importance of an Eleanor or an Elizabeth, it is  lfthryth who has the honour of being the  first queen of England .  lfthryth s reign came at a decisive time in English history. The second half of the ninth century had seen the Vikings subdue the north and east of England. Only the kingdom of Wessex, south of the Thames, survived   and this only thanks to the dogged efforts of Alfred the Great (r871 99). Under Alfred s successors, the English went on the offensive, and by his grandson  thelstan s time (r924 39) most of what is now England had been brought under their control. Later kings had to fight hard to maintain these gains, but in the end they succeeded.  lfthryth herself was born in the early to mid-940s to a prominent family in the South West. Upon coming of age, she was married to  thelwold, the ealdorman of East Anglia (a royal officer, the equivalent of the later  earl ).  thelwold s family was one of the most powerful in England (his father had borne the nickname  half-king , on account of his quasi-regal standing) and in this capacity he was responsible for almost a quarter of the realm. However,  thelwold soon died under circumstances that are unclear. But rather than a setback, this proved the making of the young  lfthryth. Rival spouses In 964  lfthryth, still only in her late teens or early twenties, went on to marry King Edgar, who had himself succeeded to the throne five years earlier. Like  lfthryth, Edgar had been married before. In fact, he had two prior spouses, one of whom was still alive. Not surprisingly, there were questions as to whether this was a true marriage  till death do us part : an indissoluble union in the language of the church. Such concerns were soon put to rest, however. On the occasion of the marriage itself, Edgar granted land to his new wife   a particular honour accorded to neither of his previous consorts. In fact, this seems to have been a different kind of union from the outset. Unlike her predecessors,  lfthryth regularly appeared in government records. And, far from being there for purely decorative purposes, she seems to have influenced and guided royal policy. Before this, royal wives had been minor players. They appear only rarely in the documentary record, and when they do, they invariably bear the title  king s wife  or  king s consort  rather than  queen . Such terms emphasise the dependency of these women on their husband; queen was not yet an office in its own right. But this too was now to change. From the start,  lfthryth is styled  queen . The ruins of Corfe Castle, Dorset, England. (Alamy) The reason for this change lies in another break with tradition:  lfthryth was also the first consort of England to be crowned and consecrated. The tradition of royal consecration had developed on the continent in the early Middle Ages. At its heart lay the ritual anointing of the monarch with holy oil and investment with symbols of office (above all, the crown   hence the modern term  coronation ). The ceremony enacted and symbolised the transition from heir apparent to king, and was thought to endow the monarch with divine favour. It made him king  by the grace of God . Royal consecration had become common in England in the ninth century, but it was reserved for ruling monarchs, invariably men. That  lfthryth should be formally anointed like her husband marks an important point of departure. It indicates that, in both practical and symbolic terms, queenship was starting to become an office.  lfthryth s influence would not be owed entirely to her husband, but also to  divine grace . The partnership between  lfthryth and Edgar is visible throughout the remaining years of his reign. In the year of their marriage, they began to reform the bishopric of Winchester. This was a process that involved removing the existing clergy, who were accused of lax standards, and replacing them with monks. In future years, the two worked closely to foster similar reforms elsewhere. And when, in 973, Edgar decided to undergo a spectacular second coronation at Bath,  lfthryth was right there by his side. A succession struggle In early July 975, at the height of his powers, Edgar died at the age of no more than 32. This had not been foreseen, and a succession struggle soon erupted. This pitted  lfthryth and Edgar s son,  thelred, against Edgar s eldest son, Edward ( thelred s half-brother). Most surprising is that there was a dispute at all. Though succession rules had yet to be formalised, it was generally anticipated that the eldest son would succeed (at least in the absence of a royal brother). That some were willing to back the much younger son  thelred, who may only have been six at the time, requires some explanation. It s likely that the imposing figure of  lfthryth lay behind their decision. As queen, she had enjoyed great power and influence and was understandably hesitant to let go of this. Edward s succession posed a real threat to her. If Edward proved long-lived, there was every chance that  thelred might be cut out of the succession. Yet  lfthryth was not just power-hungry. As a consecrated queen, she may have felt that she was more legitimate than Edgar s previous wives: his only true consort. And if this were so, then  thelred was his only true offspring. It was this that seems to have been the real point of contention: was Edward a throne-worthy heir, or an illegitimate bastard? Some were clearly convinced of the latter, but in the end age trumped legitimacy and Edward was consecrated king in his father s stead. Edward s succession was a major blow to  lfthryth, and such wounds were not easily healed. Barely had Edward taken control of the realm, when he was killed at Corfe in Dorset by supporters of  thelred and  lfthryth. He had been travelling to visit the two at the time, and it is hardly surprising that suspicion has often fallen upon them. However, contemporary sources, of which there is little shortage, do not implicate them. We are probably dealing with a situation rather like that of Henry II and Thomas Becket two centuries later: one of zealous supporters seeking to do their masters a favour, and going beyond their orders. Whatever the precise circumstances, this act landed  thelred on the throne that his mother had worked so hard to secure for him. However, he was still a child (no older than 12, and perhaps only eight or nine) so there could be no question of him ruling on his own. Instead, an informal regency was established with  lfthryth and her supporters at its head. For the next six years, it was they who would rule with quiet efficiency. Only when the queen regent s chief allies,  lfhere of Mercia and Bishop  thelwold of Winchester, died in quick succession in 983 and 984, did  thelred finally take control of affairs. Initially, he distanced himself from the politics of his regents, and for the next eight or nine years  lfthryth disappears from the record entirely. She was clearly removed from court, and her policies with her. Crisis of confidence These years saw something of a youthful rebellion from the teenage  thelred, who took the opportunity to promote new favourites and attack religious houses associated with his earlier regents. Yet it was also at this juncture that the Vikings began to plague his coasts. In 991 they defeated a major English force at Maldon in Essex.  thelred suddenly suffered a crisis of confidence. As was common in the Middle Ages, the king interpreted this as a sign of divine displeasure, and set about mending his errant ways   starting with restoring his mother to favour. He welcomed  lfthryth back at court and reversed previous policies.  thelred also charged his mother with the important task of raising his children (her own grandchildren, the heirs to the throne). Reconciliation seems to have been complete. When  lfthryth died on 17 November 1001, the king was deeply moved. She was buried at Wherwell, the nunnery she had founded in Hampshire. Soon after  thelred issued an extraordinary document in favour of this centre. Like most royal enactments, the resulting text opens with a meditation on God s will. Yet unlike other documents of the era, this quotes the biblical dictum:  Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return,  then cites the fifth commandment:  Honour thy father and thy mother .  lfthryth s legacy lived on in the queens who followed her.  thelred s second wife, Emma of Normandy, cut quite the figure in future years, as did Edith, the wife of Edward the Confessor (and the sister of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England). The office of queen had been born, and had a long and bright history before it. Levi Roach is a lecturer in history at the University of Exeter and author of  thelred the Unready (Yale University Press, 2016).  lfthryth s inspiration Two women who set the template for the queen s achievements In the years before  lfthryth, the status of royal women varied significantly. The dynasty that united England in the early 10th century was that of Wessex (south of the Thames), and prevailing attitudes were drawn from there. At the time of Alfred the Great, the king s Welsh biographer, Bishop Asser, criticised the  strange  West Saxon tradition of denying royal consorts the title of queen   a custom that reportedly went back to the king Beorhtric in the early ninth century (r786 802), whose wife accidentally poisoned him! This is the stuff of legend, but whatever the real grounds, West Saxon royal women   aside from Judith, crowned queen of the West Saxons in 856   did not have a high profile. Elsewhere, matters were different. In the Midlands kingdom of Mercia, royal wives traditionally held a more active role. It is here that the most famous female figure of the 10th century is to be found:  thelfl d,  lady of the Mercians .  thelfl d was the eldest daughter of Alfred the Great. She married the Mercian nobleman  thelred, who oversaw the region on Alfred s behalf. When her husband died in 911, she took power, working with her brother, King Edward the Elder (r899 924), to conquer much of the east Midlands and East Anglia. Her political links to Wessex doubtless helped her position, but her achievement is no less impressive for this. She may have offered a model for  lfthryth, whose first husband hailed from East Anglia. Another likely inspiration was Eadgifu, wife of Edward the Elder. Little is known about Eadgifu during her husband s reign, but when her sons Edmund (r939 46) and Eadred (r946 55) ruled, she seems to have been the power behind the throne.",

        "content": "The torched city burns as thousands of imperial troops pillage Rome on 6 May 1527, as depicted by a 16th or 17th-century Italian artist. (AKG) Ad 4 May 1926: The General Strike fails to paralyse Britain To many people, the first full day of the General Strike on 4 May 1926 represented a turning point in history. After years of mounting tension between employers and unions, particularly in the coal industry, the Trades Union Congress finally ordered its members out. On that first morning, docks, factories and rail yards across the country stood empty and silent. Conservative newspapers warned that this would mark the beginning of a Bolshevik revolution. In Blackburn, one man later remembered, his family  sat in silence in the kitchen, holding their breath, waiting for the revolution to begin . Across the country, a strange sense of unreality took hold. With public transport having ground to a halt, the roads were packed.  The mill chimneys ceased to smoke and the wheels ceased to turn,  one woman in Manchester wrote afterwards.  The pavement and even the roads were crowded with pedestrians and the drivers of private cars offered lifts with surprising generosity.  Reports of fighting came from the docks, while the government deployed troops to escort food convoys. Yet the widely predicted class warfare failed to materialise, and the General Strike never evolved into a revolutionary uprising. Indeed, compared with turbulence overseas, it turned into a bit of a non-event. By the time it fizzled out nine days later, King George V   who had upbraided his Conservative ministers for their attitude to the strikers ( Try living on their wages before you judge them )   considered it a tribute to British unity.  Our dear old country can be well proud of itself,  he wrote in his diary.  It shows what a wonderful people we are.  6 May 1527: The army of the Holy Roman Emperor sacks Rome In the early 16th century, Italy was a dangerous place to live. Torn apart by endless wars between the French king, Francis I, and his bitter rival, Charles V, king of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, the peninsula had become a byword for massacres, plunder and rapine. But nothing made a greater impression on the European imagination than what happened on 6 May 1527, the day the imperial army hurled itself on Rome. The sack of Rome was never part of Charles V s plan. His troops had already beaten the French; the problem was that funds had run short   so the imperial army s commander, the Duke of Bourbon, had effectively lost control over his own men. Only by promising them loot from the capture of Rome did the duke manage to prevent a full-scale mutiny. And so it was that on 6 May, at least 20,000 imperial soldiers began their assault. Disastrously, the duke, wearing his trademark white cloak, was shot and killed almost immediately   and any semblance of discipline disappeared. What followed was an orgy of plunder and vandalism as the imperial army swept aside the feeble resistance and rampaged through the city. Inside the Vatican, the Swiss Guard made a desperate last stand as Pope Clement VII escaped to the Castel Sant Angelo. They were slaughtered where they stood, their captain cut down in full view of his watching wife. Meanwhile, imperial troops were ransacking churches, tombs and cemeteries. In all, at least 12,000 people were estimated to have been murdered.  The Germans were bad,  said one churchman.  The Italians were worse; the Spanish were the worst.  6 May 1840: The Penny Black revolutionises communications in Britain Rowland Hill had a vision. While a small boy in Kidderminster, he had watched in embarrassment as his mother scrabbled for money to pay the postman. By the 1830s, Hill, now a teacher and social reformer, was determined to push through a change that he believed would transform the Post Office into a force for progress: universal penny postage, paid in advance. By May 1840, Hill s scheme was up and running. As he explained, people would prove that they had paid by using  a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp, and covered at the back with a glutinous wash, which the bringer might, by applying a little moisture, attach to the back of the letter . He enlisted the Royal Mint s chief engraver to create a memorable image   a picture of Queen Victoria. Today we know his creation as the Penny Black. The first stamps went on sale on 1 May, and the system came into operation five days later. One schoolboy recalled that he did not  fancy making my mouth a glue pot,  while the newssheet The Town ran a saucy poem:  You must kiss our fair Queen, or her pictures, that s clear. Or the gummy medallion will never adhere. You will not kiss her hand, you will readily find But actually kiss little Vicky s behind.  The Penny Black was an instant hit. Within a week the presses were working round the clock producing 600,000 stamps a day. The stamp had become an icon, a symbol of national pride: an image of Britannia itself.

Like his father, the ill-starred John, Henry III had spent decades feuding with his barons while attempting to raise money. In particular, he found himself pitted against the ruthless Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who was determined to uphold the principles of Magna Carta and secure more power for England s magnates. Both sides had begun preparing for war in the early 1260s, but it was not until 14 May 1264 that their armies clashed in earnest. Montfort had cornered the royal army in the Sussex town of Lewes. The night before battle was joined, the barons  leader slept not a wink, preferring instead to give his time  to divine offices and prayers and exhorting his men to make sincere confessions . Montfort need not have worried. When battle commenced the following day, the royal troops  lack of discipline proved fatal. Though the king s son, the future Edward I, led a stirring cavalry charge that broke his enemy s left wing, he was unable to rally his men back to their positions. In the confusion, Montfort s men crushed the rest of the king s army. Henry himself   who was almost 50 years old   fought bravely, but to no avail. By evening, he and his son had retreated to Lewes Priory, and the following day they formally surrendered to Simon de Montfort. It was one of the most humiliating moments in Plantagenet history. 16 May 1900: Mafeking is relieved The Boer War began disastrously for Britain. The autumn of 1899 saw one defeat after another, while at Mafeking, on the border between British-held Cape Colony and the Transvaal, some 1,500 British troops were surrounded by a far larger Boer army. On 12 October the telegraph lines were cut; four days later the first Boer shells landed in the dusty little town. Yet for more than 200 days, the defenders held out. Inspired by their commander, Colonel Robert Baden-Powell, they not only laid fake landmines and mounted daring diversionary attacks, but always made time for Sunday cricket matches. In Britain, the valiant resistance of the Mafeking defenders gripped the public imagination. By May 1900, with a relief column on its way, it seemed that everybody was waiting for news of victory. And, at last, it came. Late on the evening of 16 May, the defenders heard firing to the north. At about 7.30pm, seven British cavalrymen rode into the town. As they paused, tired and dusty, a passer-by said casually:  Oh yes, I heard you were knocking about.  The main relief column arrived in Mafeking just before four o clock next morning. By then, crowds had poured into the streets, filled with unbridled joy.  One man tried to speak; then he swore; then he buried his face in his arms and sobbed,  wrote a watching reporter. But that was as nothing compared with the reaction back home: a week s worth of hysterical rejoicing ensued, complete with street parties and fireworks. The defenders of Mafeking, wrote the author FT Stevens,  carried themselves like Britons of the old breed  and because they played the game and played up well, and played to the end, and by the will of God have won, we honour them and count the country richer this day for them.  16 May 1703: Peter the Great founds his namesake city Even by the standards of Russia s colourful history, the foundation of St Petersburg makes an extraordinary story. In May 1703, the dynamic young emperor Peter the Great had cut his way through Swedish forces to the Baltic coastline. His eye was drawn to a small island at the mouth of the river Neva where Finnish fishermen had built a few wooden huts. The story goes that Peter borrowed a bayonet to cut two strips of turf, which he laid in the shape of a cross.  Here,  he proclaimed,  shall be a town.  The first stone was laid on 16 May (27 May in the Gregorian calendar.) Whether or not this story is true, Peter s ambition was astounding. The cold, marshy conditions could hardly have been less propitious, and he was still fighting the Swedes. Yet by the end of May his men had built a small log house for Peter, and by year s end they had finished a great hexagonal citadel, the Peter and Paul Fortress, which still stands today. Yet the birth of St Petersburg did not come without a horrendous cost. The Swedes launched fresh attacks each year, but the biggest problems were caused by the conditions. Draining the marshes demanded almost superhuman effort; men poured into the site from as far afield as Finland, Siberia and Ukraine. They lived in primitive, crowded, dirty hovels; many died from dysentery, scurvy or malaria. St Petersburg, men said, was a  city built on bones . But it endured. Indeed, nothing better symbolises Peter s vision than the gleaming, soaring gold spire of the Peter and Paul Cathedral. Work began on it in 1712; by the time it was completed in 1733, Peter was long dead. His city, though, lives on. This rather romantic depiction of the founding of St Petersburg was painted in 1838 by Alexei Gavrilovich Venetsianov. (Superstock) 24 May 1487: Lambert Simnel is crowned king in Dublin In the spring of 1487, Henry VII sat uneasily on his throne. It was less than two years since he had taken the crown by force at Bosworth, and he had already put down one Yorkist uprising. But then, at the end of May 1487, word reached Henry that the worst had happened. A Yorkist pretender claiming to be the young Earl of Warwick had been crowned king in Dublin, and an Irish army was on its way to England. In reality, as Henry knew perfectly well, Warwick was safely locked in the Tower of London. The imposter was a tradesman s son, 10-year-old Lambert Simnel (though this name is doubtful). He had been groomed by a Yorkist priest called Richard Symonds, who put it about that Warwick had escaped from the Tower and was now under his guidance. The priest then sailed to Ireland and presented young Simnel to the lord deputy, the Earl of Kildare, who was no fan of Henry VII. Kildare was also not a fool, and almost certainly knew that Simnel was an imposter   but the prospect of playing kingmaker was too tempting to resist. On 24 May, Simnel was paraded through the streets of Dublin. At the Priory of the Holy Trinity, later Christ Church Cathedral, he was crowned king of England with a gold circlet borrowed from a statue of the Virgin Mary. Afterwards he was carried through the streets on the back of a giant Irishman, one D Arcy of Platten. But the plot soon began to unravel. When the rebels met Henry s forces at Stoke Field in Nottinghamshire, the result was utter disaster for the Irish troops. For little Lambert Simnel, though, there was a surprisingly happy ending. Showing unexpected mercy, Henry gave him a job in his kitchens. Simnel reputedly later became a falconer, dying peacefully in his bed during the reign of Henry VIII. Lambert Simnel is depicted as the  Knight of the Golden Tulip  on a 17th-century playing card. (Bridgeman Art) 25 May 1895: Oscar Wilde is convicted Oscar Wilde s decision to launch a libel action against the Marquess of Queensberry, who had accused him of  posing somdomite [sic] , was the most unfortunate he ever made. The trial opened on 3 April 1895 and almost immediately it was obvious that Wilde was in deep trouble. When the defence announced that they had found several male prostitutes who would testify that they had had sex with Wilde, the playwright dropped the case   but, even as he left the courtroom, the authorities were drawing up a warrant for his arrest on charges of gross indecency. At Wilde s first trial, which opened on 26 April, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Three weeks later, a second trial began at the Old Bailey, prosecuted by the Liberal government s solicitor general, Sir Frank Lockwood. Wilde wrote later that Lockwood had issued an  appalling denunciation   like something out of Tacitus, like a passage in Dante, like one of Savonarola s indictments of the popes of Rome . This was an exaggeration: by the standards of the day, Lockwood s closing statement was remarkably restrained. But it is easy to understand why Wilde was so distraught. On 25 May, the foreman announced the jury s verdict: guilty. There were cries of  Shame!  from the gallery, and Wilde turned grey with horror.  It is no use for me to address you. People who can do these things must be dead to all sense of shame, and one cannot hope to produce any effect upon them. It is the worst case I have ever tried,  said Mr Justice Wills, who sentenced Wilde to two years of hard labour. It was, he added,  the severest sentence that the law allows. In my judgment it is totally inadequate for a case such as this.

        "content": "When Charles IV of France died without a son in 1328, Charles s first cousin was chosen to succeed, becoming King Philip VI. Yet Edward III of England, as the deceased king s nearest male relation, was considered by some to have the stronger claim. When Phillip VI confiscated the duchy of Aquitaine from England in 1337, Edward III responded by pressing his claim to the French throne, beginning the Hundred Years  War. The conflict saw major developments in military strategy and technology and the final French victory at Castillon in 1453 was the first major field engagement of the war to be decided by gunfire. Here, historian David Green, author of The Hundred Years War: A People's History, shares seven lesser-known facts about the series of conflicts  Ad A Hundred Years  War? The first thing anyone usually learns about the Hundred Years  War is that it did not last 100 years. Tradition dates it from 1337 to 1453, but in some ways it is more helpful to view this longest of European wars as one phase of an even longer struggle between England and France, stretching perhaps from the Norman Conquest of 1066 until the 1904 Entente Cordiale [a series of agreements signed between Great Britain and France that marked the end of hundreds of years of intermittent conflict between the two states.] Conflict with the  ancient enemy  has shaped the identities of both countries, and memories of the war remain long on both sides of the Channel. Charles de Gaulle remarked in June 1962:  Our greatest hereditary enemy was not Germany, it was England. From the Hundred Years  War to Fashoda, she hardly ceased to struggle against us  she is not naturally inclined to wish us well.  V for Victory? The legend that the origins of the  v  sign can be found in the Hundred Years  War is, sadly, just legendary. There are no contemporary sources that suggest English archers, as an insult, raised to the French the two fingers with which they drew their longbows, nor that the French dismembered captured archers   removing those same fingers and thus preventing them from ever firing a bow again. There is, however, an account of the French  mooning  a detachment of English troops during the campaign that led to the battle of Cr cy. This so enraged the English that they launched an ill-advised attack on a well-defended position and were beaten back with heavy losses. Battle of Cr cy, 26 August 1346. Hand-coloured later. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Total war? We are often told that  total war  is a sad product of the modern, industrial age. It is, however, difficult to find any section of English or French society that was not affected by the Hundred Years  War. The peasantry in both countries, for example, were central to the war effort and suffered greatly as a consequence. Indeed, its members were targeted directly: because of the connection between taxation (paid chiefly by the peasantry) and military defence, the status of  non-combatants  became very uncertain during the war. So, by attacking taxpayers, the English also attacked French military resources. Furthermore, as the war unfolded it became a consciously  national  struggle and, consequently, there were few reasons non-combatants should be immune from its effects. This policy and its brutally sophisticated implementation are clear from a letter written in 1355 by Sir John Wingfield, who served in the retinue of Edward the Black Prince (1330 76): Read more | This medieval  apocalypse  left a legacy no one saw coming It seems certain that since the war against the French king began, there has never been such destruction in a region as in this raid. For the countryside and towns which have been destroyed... produced more revenue for the king of France in aid of his war than half his kingdom  as I could prove from authentic documents found in various towns in the tax-collectors  houses. Wingfield served as  governor of the prince s business  (essentially his business manager), and he wrote in the aftermath of the so-called grande chevauch e (a raid across southern France in which an army of around 6,000 soldiers destroyed 500 settlements of various sorts   villages, castles, towns, hamlets - and may have devastated up to 18,000 square kilometres of territory). The Black Prince, however, was not content merely to orchestrate and witness the destruction, he wished to determine its exact extent, and so he brought officials such as Wingfield with him to calculate the precise cost to the French treasury. The psychological cost of this sort of raiding   the fear and insecurity it surely engendered   is more difficult to measure, but as the war drew on in France the ringing of church bells might as easily mean an impending raid as a call to prayer. Rituals at the battle of Agincourt The battle of Agincourt began at about 11am on 25 October 1415 (the feast day of Saints Crispin and Crispian). It had not been a pleasant night: heavy rain had turned the ploughed field between the two armies into something approaching a quagmire. The English and French forces had deployed in the cold before dawn, and hours had passed without either side making any move. Finally, King Henry V (r1413 22) ordered an advance. But before they moved forward, a fascinating and seemingly extraordinary act took place: each man knelt   archers and men-at-arms alike   kissed the ground, and took a little earth in his mouth. This collective and yet deeply personal ritual seems to have been sacramental; a ceremony that combined elements of the Eucharist with the burial service. It served as a blessing, a purification, and a preparation for death. Throughout the Anglo-French war, battles had enormous religious and symbolic significance. Not only was victory or defeat an indication of divine judgement, but for many it might bring one decidedly closer to divine judgement of a very personal nature. The battle of Agincourt, 25 October 1415, (1910). (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) We few, we happy few: part one While chronicle accounts allow us to reconstruct the narrative of the battle of Agincourt with some precision, the size of the opposing forces remains a matter of contention. Shakespeare would have us believe that in 1415 the English were outnumbered at least 10-to-one. Such a number was shaped by dramatic necessity and also by various contemporary and near-contemporary English sources that suggested the French army totalled between 60,000 and 160,000 men. Such numbers are patently absurd given what we know of the possibilities of military recruitment at this time; they were grossly inflated with the aim of exaggerating the scale of Henry s victory. Recent work makes it clear that the Valois army was considerably more modest in size, perhaps 20,000 30,000 troops. And, indeed, in her 2005 account of the battle, Anne Curry argues that the French army was smaller still, numbering no more than 12,000 soldiers. By comparison, Henry commanded between 6,000 and 9,000 soldiers   the anonymous author of the Gesta Henrici Quinti (The Deeds of Henry V), who witnessed the battle, suggested he led 5,000 archers and around 1,000 men-at-arms (although the numbering is not precise). The French, therefore, outnumbered the English by two to one, but probably no more. We few, we happy few: part two Some other aspects of Shakespeare s account of the battle closely accord with contemporary accounts, and there is good reason to believe them to be accurate. When Sir Walter Hungerford (1378 1449) bemoaned the lack of archers in his company, Henry is said (again by the author of the Gesta Henrici Quinti) to have reprimanded him in a speech remarkably similar to that familiar from Shakespeare:  That is a foolish way to talk , the king said,  because by God in Heaven  I would not, even if I could, have a single man more than I do. For these I have here with me are God s people  Do you not believe that the Almighty, with these His humble few, is able to overcome the opposing arrogance of the French . Guns and gunpowder The Hundred Years  War saw some major developments in military strategy and technology. Indeed, some historians have argued that these changes amount to a  military revolution . Among such developments, the evolution of gunpowder weaponry was particularly significant. That evolutionary process was, however, a slow one. At Agincourt, for example, it appears that French artillery accounted for a solitary English archer during the battle, and in 1431 Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, fired 412 cannonballs into the town of Lagny and succeeded only in killing a chicken. Nonetheless, as the war entered its final phase such weapons were becoming increasingly effective. They played important roles in a number of Joan of Arc s battles and sieges, and the  Maid  was considered particularly adept in aiming the weapons. Then, in the late 1430s, Charles VII (1422 61) took steps to put in place a professional artillery train under the command of the Bureau brothers   John, the king s Master Gunner, and his brother, Gaspard. Thereafter, the weapons available to the French grew in number and efficiency, and they proved their worth in successive sieges. Gunpowder weapons allowed the French to eject the English from Normandy and Gascony with astonishing speed. In 1437, the castle of Castelnau-de-Cern s in Gascony was  broken down... by cannon and engines, and a great part of the walls were thrown to the ground . In some cases, as at Bourg in 1451, the mere presence of guns was sufficient to bring about an immediate surrender. Around this time, gunpowder weapons also began to be used effectively as field artillery. Formigny in 1450 (a decisive victory for the French) may have been the first battle decided by gunpowder artillery. The engagement began with a cavalry assault on the English infantry and longbowmen, which was repulsed. Soon afterwards, however, the Bureau brothers arrived with two breechloading culverins on wheeled carriages. These were capable of a high rate of fire and could outdistance the English archers. Although it required the arrival of further reinforcements to decide the battle, the artillery clearly played a telling role. This was also the case at Castillon in 1453 (a decisive French victory), the final engagement of the Hundred Years  War. This was, undoubtedly, determined by artillery, and, as a consequence, the battle marks a deeply significant point in the history of European warfare.

        "title": "Why  Bad King John  was actually good",
        "content": "One might have hoped that the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta would have provided at least some oxygen to the argument that  Bad King John  was perhaps not too  Bad  after all; and   whisper it   that in some ways this traditionally most maligned of monarchs was perhaps really rather Good. Ad Instead, the anticipated tsunami of popular and learned articles collectively assert, inter alia, that King John was at once cruel and coercive, treacherous and tyrannical, pusillanimous and pitiful, lazy and lackluster. For the large part it seems that, 800 years later, opinion has broadly backed Matthew Paris, the 13th-century chronicler who alleged that John s greatest achievement was, by dying, to make yet more foul the existing foulness of Hell: John was not only Bad; he was diabolical. Popular understanding of Magna Carta has significantly stunted debate on the nature and achievement of John. Magna Carta, we are told, stands for the rule of law. Invoked by those in 17th-century England who sought to thwart the allegedly despotic tendencies of Charles I, and latterly employed by the American Revolutionaries in their making of the United States Bill of Rights in 1789, Magna Carta has become totemic of the liberties by which western societies identify themselves. Indeed, this tendency has travelled so far that Magna Carta has, according to G Hindley,  acquired an almost mystic incantatory quality . This, he claims, is partly evidenced by the fact that the government sponsored the Magna Carta 800th anniversary website, which currently asserts that Magna Carta  is the foundation stone supporting the freedoms enjoyed today by hundreds of millions of people in more than 100 countries . These are powerful words, and it follows that if John ignored Magna Carta   which he did   then it must surely be the case that he was indeed malign. The ever-growing extent to which Magna Carta is celebrated and elevated necessarily means that, in equal and opposite degree, the reputation of John is tarnished and diminished. In this context, to argue that John was anything other than  Bad  seems inappropriate and somewhat unbelievable. However, the Magna Carta that John chose to ignore did not purport to be a constitutional document adumbrating and guaranteeing liberties to all English people. The Magna Carta of 1215 (it is important to realise that there were many reissues of Magna Carta after the reign of John, each different to the one presented to John) is better understood as a set of flawed peace terms designed to heal the incipient civil war between John and an element of rebellious barons. In order to try and bind John to their terms, the barons insisted that John accept a committee of 25 of their number empowered to police and enforce Magna Carta by seizing John s castles and assets when he was judged   by them, and against criteria put forth by them   to have transgressed. No medieval monarch could have accepted for any length of time the Magna Carta of 1215, for it clearly rendered the king a phantom of a monarch. Indeed, so extreme was this impact that it is not beyond sensible contemplation that the ambition of the rebel barons was not to obtain a lasting peace, but instead absolutely to provoke John to break the newly agreed terms so that they could seize his largesse. John did indeed overturn Magna Carta, but arguably any medieval monarch would have done the same. The Magna Carta of 1215 is not the Magna Carta of popular imagination. The Barons compelling King John to ratify Magna Carta. (The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Popular representations of events at Runnymede in June 1215 would also have us believe that leading rebel barons such as Eustace de Vesci and Robert Fitzwalter were revered freedom fighters. In fact, they are better understood as tight-knuckled, low browed feudal reactionaries kicking against John s increasingly efficacious administration. A considerable body of evidence in the form of pipe rolls, charters and letters patent indicates strongly that John was highly effective   perhaps too effective   in mobilizing the resources of his kingdom and in imposing the royal will upon the population at large. This apparently incontestable evidence shows John to have been possessed of vigour and vim, constantly on the move enforcing Angevin aspirations. Ironically, the very fact that John faced rebellion in 1215 is itself indicative of the fact that his government had bite as well as bark. Moreover, even though chronicle sources allege that the whole of the baronage was united against John, this was clearly not the case   not least because there would have been no possibility of civil war if there had not been two sides, each with the wherewithal to resist the other. Indeed, by the spring of 1215, it has been estimated that of England s 197 baronies only 39 were in active opposition to the king, with perhaps the same number acting in his support. Nor is it true that John antagonized elements of the baronage because he was lacking in martial prowess, or that the king was  Softsword , as the chroniclers assert. His reluctance to commit to pitched battles was entirely conventional in an age when all leaders preferred to avoid them   John s arch-enemy, Philip Augustus, King of France (r1180 1223) shied away from a setpiece battle at least as frequently as his protagonist. We should not mistake John s military caution for cowardice. Instead, John prosecuted siege warfare with the sort of energy, determination and success that is usually only spoken of in reference to Henry II and Richard I. Thus, we see him, for example, razing the walls and castle of Le Mans in 1200, assaulting the forces besieging Mirebeau in 1202 (having covered a distance of 80 miles in 48 hours), marching upon Montauban in 1206 and pressing the siege of Rochester castle in 1215   an event that the leading authority of castles and castle warfare in this period considers was  the greatest operation in England up to that time  (RA Brown). John was also an effective strategist. His plan to relieve the siege of Chateau-Gaillard in 1203 by arranging a simultaneous assault from land and amphibious forces has been described as  a masterpiece of ingenuity by K Norgate. Even John s much-criticised twin-pronged invasion of France in 1214 (which culminated in the disastrous battle of Bouvines on 27 July 1214) achieved its basic aim of dividing the Capetian forces. John s alleged lasciviousness and acts of cruelty have been presented as further character traits that antagonised the barons and thus prevented him from delivering strong kingship. Lusting after the wives and daughters of those men he relied upon to deliver the royal command was no doubt a problem in a world where private relationships were the stuff of high politics. Yet nearly all medieval kings took mistresses. Indeed, William the Conqueror s loyalty to his wife, Matilda, was the subject of perplexed comment. If John was indeed a  smutty minded groper  (CJ Tyerman), he remained a rake rather than a rogue. His marriage to Isabella of Angouleme when she was unlikely to have been more than 15 and quite possibly as young as nine has prompted a flood of accusations that John was a 13th-century Humbert Humbert. Yet marriage at an early age was commonplace at the time   a survey of the marriage arrangements of John s contemporaries leads to the conclusion that the Angevin king had an eye for an older women! Isabella of Angouleme, queen consort of King John. (The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Further contextual analysis also diminishes the charge that John was a perverted purveyor of acts of cruelty. The evidence does not permit John to be charged definitively with killing his nephew, Arthur, but the king nevertheless had arguably legitimate reasons to undertake such an act since Arthur (a 16-year-old boy) had put himself at the head of a rebellion sponsored by Philip Augustus. Similarly, it is not proven that John starved Matilda de Braose and her son to death in Corfe Castle, but if he did so it was because of her refusal to offer her sons as hostages in order to trim the rebellious behaviour of their father. Yet hostage taking was part-and-parcel of medieval government, and as such it follows that they sometimes paid the ultimate price. Indeed, King Stephen was seen as weak for refusing to hang the son of Marshal when the latter broke the terms of an agreement with the king. If John is guilty of cruelty, then what of Richard I in 1191 when, following a dispute about the terms upon which Acre had been surrendered, he ordered the killing of 2,700 Muslim prisoners? What of Henry V, who during the battle of Agincourt in 1415 ordered the killing of several thousand French prisoners? What of John s father, Henry II who, having taken 22 hostages from the Welsh in 1165, ordered that the males among them   some of them sons of princes   be blinded and castrated, and that the females should have their noses and ears cut off? Medieval monarchs were expected to be fierce, and John fulfilled those expectations. The Barnwell annalist, Walter Of Coventry, concluded that John  was indeed a great prince but less than successful [and that] he met with both kinds of luck . John was certainly unlucky in that his reign coincided with probably the two most accomplished leaders of the Middle Ages   Philip Augustus and Pope Innocent III (r1198 1216)   and he was certainly unlucky in that the Angevin  empire  he had inherited in 1199 was increasingly ungovernable and assaulted by fissiparous tendencies. Yet, I argue, he was not  less than successful . John s achievement is that he held things together for as long as he did. Ad Graham Seel is head of history at St Paul s School in London.

        "content": "Ad The execution of Anne Boleyn On the morning of 19 May 1536, Henry VIII s second wife, Anne Boleyn, became the first English queen to be publicly executed. Charged with adultery, incest and conspiring the king s death, Anne was beheaded on a scaffold erected on Tower Green, within the walls of the Tower of London. Her death, says historian Suzannah Lipscomb,  is so familiar to us that it is hard to imagine how shocking it would have been . Anne and Henry had been married for little more than three years at the time of her death. For her, Henry had left his wife of nearly 24 years and the mother of his child (the future Mary I), and broken with the Catholic Church. By the spring of 1536, however, Henry s affection had waned and he was hotly pursuing Anne s lady-in-waiting, Jane Seymour. Along with five courtiers, including Anne s brother, George, Anne was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London in early May 1536. Mark Smeaton, William Brereton, Francis Weston and Henry Norris were tried and found guilty of adultery with the queen, and of conspiring the king s death, while Anne and her brother were found guilty of high treason. By 19 May, all six convicted had been executed. Reporting on Anne s execution in 1536, Eustace Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador to Henry s court, wrote:  No one ever shewed more courage or greater readiness to meet death than she did . Today, nearly 500 years after her execution, historians cannot agree why Anne had to die.

Constructed overnight on 12 13 August 1961 by the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the wall s official purpose was to stop western  fascists  from entering east Germany and undermining the building of a socialist state. In reality, however, it served to prevent mass defections from east to west. Berliners awoke on 13 August to find themselves cut off from family, friends, work and in some cases even their homes   it was now impossible to get from east to west. The makeshift wall was soon replaced by a 12ft-tall, 4ft-wide reinforced concrete barrier, heavily guarded and lined with booby traps. In total at least 171 people were killed trying to get over, under or around the Berlin Wall, which stood until 9 November 1989. To find out more, click here.

Of the 2,208 people aboard ship   the largest vessel in the world at the time   only 712 survived. It took just two-and-a-half hours for the huge vessel to sink, and amid freezing temperatures many people are likely to have died within minutes of entering the water. The extent of the devastation was not known until several days later   reporting on the disaster on 16 April, the Daily Mail s headline read  Titanic sunk. No lives lost . The tragedy, says Titanic expert Dr Aidan McMichael, was greeted at first  with shock and disbelief, and then immense sorrow at the scale of the loss of life.

The fire began in the early hours of Sunday 2 September 1666, at the house of Thomas Farynor (aka Farrinor), the king's baker, in Pudding Lane, near London Bridge. Helped by a strong easterly wind coupled with dry and dusty air, the fire raged for three days, by the end of which 100,000 people had been made homeless. Officially only a handful of people died in the fire but the true toll is likely to have been much higher. This Witness episode brings together the first-hand accounts of diarist Samuel Pepys and schoolboy William Taswell, who watched the fire devastate the city.

The first man in space On 12 April 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to journey into space, making a 108-minute orbital flight in his Vostok 1 spacecraft. Dressed in a bright orange spacesuit and a helmet inscribed with  CCCP  painted in red (which marked him as a Soviet citizen so that he would be recognised after parachuting to safety following ejection from the spacecraft), the 27-year-old Gagarin set off with the word  Poyekhali!  (Let s go!). Sergei Khrushchev, the son of Nikita Khrushchev, who was the Soviet premier at the time of Gagarin's flight, told BBC News in 2010:  When we look at the response of the Muscovites, where everyone was in the streets, on the roofs of buildings and in the windows, I would compare this celebration with the May 9 victory day (the end of the Second World War for the Soviet Union) .

A horror that shocked the world, the Salem witch trials have spawned hundreds of films, books, scholarly articles and plays, including Arthur Miller s acclaimed 1953 work The Crucible. The executed men and women were convicted on the spurious evidence of a group of young village girls who claimed to have been bewitched. Paranoia, fed by ongoing family feuds and attacks by Native Americans, developed into a wave of hysteria that quickly spread throughout colonial Massachusetts. Another 150 men, women and children were accused in the spring of 1692, and were only spared the gallows by confessing. To find out more, click here.

It claimed the lives of more than nine million soldiers and an unknown number of civilians, and, says the Imperial War Museum,  forever altered the world s social and political landscape . Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914 after weeks of tension following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo on 28 June. Over the coming months, as Europe descended into war, it became clear the war would not be  won by Christmas .

Panic gripped the city as police hunted for the killer and speculation was rife as to his   or her   identity. Was Jack a doctor, a Jew, a foreigner, a butcher? Was Jack in fact Jill? One theory even linked the murders to Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Victor. Yet despite interrogating dozens of suspects the police failed to convict anyone of the murders, and to this day the killer s identity remains a mystery.

The only unplundered tomb of a pharaoh yet found in the Valley of the Kings, the tomb was filled with artefacts including statues and artwork   so many, in fact, that it took 10 years to catalogue them. The 1922 discovery, says art critic Alastair Sooke, sparked a global frenzy for ancient Egypt.  A craze for Egyptian exoticism convulsed the West, infiltrating both high and low culture across the fields of music, fine art, fashion, film and furniture design.  Carter became a worldwide celebrity, touring America in 1924 to deliver lectures about his finds. This Witness episode explores Carter s detailed record of his discovery. To listen, click here.

Within the first three seconds, says expert Stephen Walker, thousands were incinerated as the temperature at the burst-point reached 60 million degrees centigrade   10,000 times hotter than the sun s surface. The attack was followed three days later by a second atomic bomb dropped on the city of Nagasaki, which killed at least 50,000 people, although according to some estimates as many as 74,000 died. Many of the survivors suffered symptoms of radiation sickness, which include vomiting, fever, fatigue, bleeding from the gums, thinning hair, diarrhoea and, in the worst cases, death.

Just two-and-a-half years earlier, in November 1658, Cromwell had been given a state funeral at Westminster. An officer in the Roundheads (parliamentary army) at the outbreak of the Civil War in the summer of 1642, Cromwell went on to become one of the conflict s key figures and played a leading role in Charles I s trial and subsequent beheading. Following the king s execution a republic was declared, known as the Commonwealth of England. How, then, did Cromwell's body come to be dug up and symbolically executed? Witness investigates....

        "title": "Henry VIII and the scourge of papal power",
        "content": "This article was first published in the August 2011 issue of BBC History Magazine Ad Henry VIII's most striking action and his lasting legacy was his break with Rome. In the 1530s he threw off papal jurisdiction, declared himself supreme head of the church on earth under Christ and denounced the usurpation of the pope and the superstitions of his church. Of course, in many ways the church in England was already monarchical, with bishops long nominated by the crown from the monarch s circle of counsellors and diplomats. But so boldly, persistently and vigorously to proclaim the royal supremacy was something new. Henry s daughter Mary reverted to papal obedience during her brief reign. Yet following Mary s death in 1558, her half-sister, Elizabeth, pursued Henry s policy of rejecting the authority of the papacy. Since then the Church of England has remained independent. And that has hugely affected English relations with, and attitudes to, the rulers and peoples of continental Europe. Nothing any other Tudor monarch did mattered as much. Henry did not just break with Rome. He saw himself as an Old Testament prophet king, called upon by God to purify the church. And in the 1530s the monasteries were dissolved and the practice of pilgrimage   journeys to the sites of shrines of saints   was brought to an end. Both measures had immense consequences. A society with men and women who, at least in principle, turn their face from the world and devote themselves exclusively to the worship of God is qualitatively different from one which has no monks and nuns. Immense consequences Henry was also much involved in the codification of what Christians should believe. Although he had broken from Rome, dissolved monasteries and effectively abolished pilgrimage, he rejected the Lutheran doctrine of justification-by-faith-alone and remained devoted to the mass. Henry also authorised the publication and the reading in church of the Bible in English translation, a measure which over time has had immense consequences. Henry s was thus a remarkably hybrid church. Probably very few agreed fully with the king; most would have preferred to remain Catholic while a minority wholeheartedly accepted the changes but wanted much more far-reaching reform. In many ways, Henry's influence proved decisive when it fell to Queen Elizabeth to determine the church of her realm. True, the liturgy would now be in English; but the ambiguities and ambivalences of liturgy and doctrine were not unlike those of the church of Henry's later years, just when Elizabeth was growing up. A Church of England that is, uniquely, no longer Catholic but not Protestant in any full sense, is very much Henry's legacy. Henry was also a warrior king. In 1513, 1523 and in the mid-1540s he launched invasions of France and continued to claim that he was rightfully king of France. Bold in ambition, cautious in practice, he was prepared to spend a fortune, not least the windfall of the dissolved monasteries  lands, on military campaigns which achieved little, both in France and in Scotland. And he left an appalling financial legacy to those who ruled the realm in the minority of his son, Edward. Henry was a passionate builder. Few monarchs have invested so much in grand palaces and hunting lodges. The hall of Hampton Court, which he largely rebuilt in the early 1530s, testifies to his ambitions. And his extraordinary collection did not merely leave its mark on contemporary architecture. The design of Nonsuch Palace, in which Henry was closely involved, had a huge influence on the great  prodigy houses  of Elizabethan England, and is reflected in the eclectic style of Wollaton, Hardwick and Kirby halls. Henry was also much interested in painting, and attracted to England Hans Holbein, one of the greatest artists of the age. Holbein s image of Henry VIII has had an immense impact: no English king is more recognisable. And then there are Henry s six wives, a real-life soap opera that writers of fiction would be hard-pressed to surpass. First, Catherine of Aragon, loyal to the end, but repudiated by Henry after he had fallen in love with Anne Boleyn; secondly, Anne, who three years after her marriage to Henry would be executed for treasonably committing adultery; thirdly, Jane Seymour, dying soon after giving birth to Edward; next, Anne of Cleves, a marriage arranged for diplomatic reasons but annulled as soon as foreign policy allowed since Henry found her physically repellent; then Catherine Howard, much too young, and also destroyed because she had committed adultery; and finally a more harmonious marriage to Katherine Parr. Too often, the popular image of Henry VIII has been of bluff king Hal, affable and pleasure-loving. Yet there was a darker side. Henry was exceptionally skilled in attracting the devoted service of remarkably capable counsellors   Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell. He was very astute at allowing his ministers to take public responsibility for unpopular policies   from taxation to the dissolution of the monasteries. In fact, no other Tudor ruler was as successful in leaving the impression that others were responsible   so much so that many have been deceived into thinking that he was a weak man manipulated by factions. Yet that he repeatedly destroyed his closest advisers, when in his eyes they had served their turn, argues that it was indeed Henry who brought them down. When facing opposition   or simply refusal openly to comply   no other Tudor ruler was quite so ruthless as Henry. Far from being a feeble monarch open to exploitation, he was an implacable king who, by the end of the 1530s, had turned into a tyrant.

        "title": "The secret intimacies of Edward IV: multiple marriages and a same-sex affair?",
        "content": "My research on the story of King Richard III began in the 1990s, and focused initially upon the allegation that he was a  usurper . That was a story which was later initiated by Henry VII, who seized Richard s throne, killed him, and then blackened his reputation. But the truth is that Richard was offered the throne by the three estates of the realm on the grounds that his elder brother, Edward IV, had committed bigamy, making Edward s children by Elizabeth Widville illegitimate. (Her maiden surname is commonly spelt  Woodville , but contemporary sources suggest that Widville or Wydville were more commonly employed in the 15th century. I therefore use  Widville .) Ad The story of Edward IV s bigamy intrigued me. As a result, my initial research focused upon the true story of Eleanor Talbot   the lady who was formally acknowledged in an act of parliament of 1484 as  married  to King Edward. Although some historians have questioned Eleanor s existence, I established clearly her identity, with the support of solid evidence. A picture emerged that supported the proposition that she had a relationship with King Edward IV. For example, the king appears to have given her land. Also he sent presents to her former father-in-law, Lord Sudeley, while Eleanor was alive   though following her death he changed tack and destroyed Lord Sudeley. It was also clear that the legality of Edward IV s subsequent marriage with Elizabeth Widville had always been questioned. The legality of Edward IV s subsequent marriage with Elizabeth Widville has always been questioned, says John Ashdown-Hill. (Photo by Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images) My research on the bigamy accusations led me to investigate all the other alleged stories about Edward IV and his private life. Once I d started, it rapidly emerged that, while most biographies of the king have traditionally claimed that he was born on 28 April 1442, most of them cite no source for that assertion. This is a problem, because some historians have used this birth date to back a claim that Edward himself was illegitimate. A political story, promoted by the French government and other opponents of Edward IV after he became king of England, hinted that his mother had a love affair with an archer. As a result, it was suggested that the archer, rather than Richard Duke of York, was Edward s biological father. Some modern historians have sought to back that claim by asserting that the Duke of York was not with his wife at the time of Edward s conception. But of course, that claim is based upon Edward IV s alleged birth date. When I sought out evidence for the date in question, I discovered that actually only one 15th-century source mentions 28 April 1442. Unfortunately, that source erroneously claims that the day in question was a Monday. What s more, another source offers a different date for Edward s birth. In short, I believe we can no longer claim to know for certain precisely when Edward was born. Who was Edward s real father? The allegations of illegitimacy have, of course, thrown Edward s relationship with his theoretical father, Richard Duke of York, into question. However, letters written by the Duke of York to King Charles VII of France   attempting (and failing) to set up a prestigious marriage for Edward with one of the daughters of the king of France   indicate that the duke considered Edward to be his son. That point is proved even more clearly by the wording that the duke used. In the surviving letters, he repeatedly refers to Edward as his son and heir. In his own writing, Edward naturally addressed the duke as his father. His letters suggest that a good relationship existed between them. Same-sex relationships When the Duke of York was killed in 1460, young Edward was still unmarried   and remained so when he became king of England. Shortly after his accession, however, Edward became involved with the beautiful Eleanor Talbot, and the most likely date for their secret marriage seems to have been Monday 8 June 1461, when the itinerary of Edward IV, as published in my latest book, reveals that Edward was in the vicinity of Eleanor s Warwickshire manor houses. Eleanor had produced no children by her first husband, Sir Thomas Boteler, and she doesn t seem to have become pregnant as a result of her relationship with the king. Edward IV therefore found himself confronted by a fruitless relationship. But about 18 months after his secret marriage with Eleanor, Edward encountered one of her first cousins, who may well have shared Eleanor s good looks, and who also, it seems, attracted the king. The cousin in question was Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. A wealth of clear contemporary evidence suggests that Edward loved Henry and that the two men slept together. This is by no means the only instance of an English king having a same-sex relationship. Earlier examples involved both Richard the Lionheart and King Edward II. Although Richard I s same-sex relationship worried his father, Henry II, the intimacy took place in France, and aroused no hostile response in England. Edward II wasn t so lucky. Likewise the relationship between Edward IV and the Duke of Somerset aroused opposition in some quarters. This led to an attack on the Duke of Somerset, which finally helped to break up his relationship with the king. Thomas More s version of history erased the name of Eleanor Talbot, says historian John Ashdown-Hill. (Photo by English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Another secret marriage? Later accounts   beginning with the version of  history  written by the Tudor grandee Sir Thomas More   suggest that, around this time, Edward IV took on a relationship with another young woman, Elizabeth Lucy. More even went as far as to claim that Edward IV was believed, in some quarters, to have secretly married Elizabeth Lucy. More offers a detailed story of how the young king s mother supposedly knew of this relationship. He also asserts that Richard III s subsequent claim to the throne was based upon the premise of Edward and Lucy s marriage. More goes on to say that the claim was false   making Richard III a usurper. While the offering of the English crown to Richard III was indeed based upon evidence that Edward IV had committed bigamy, the evidence clearly shows that the alleged first (and legal) wife of the young king was not called Elizabeth Lucy. She was, in fact, Lady Eleanor Talbot. Sadly, there s not a shred of contemporary evidence that a woman called Elizabeth Lucy ever existed   let alone that she had a relationship with Edward IV. The logical conclusion is that Thomas More s allegations were simply part of the attempt made by Henry VII and his successors to ensure that the name of Eleanor Talbot was written out of history. Henry VII had initiated this process in 1485, when he repealed unquoted the 1484 act of parliament that had acknowledged Eleanor as  married  to King Edward. On that occasion, Henry VII stated specifically that his aim was  that all thinges said and remembered in the said Bill and Acte thereof maie be for ever out of remembraunce and allso forgot . However, surviving letters written in 1533 and 1534 by Eustace Chapuys, the ambassador of Emperor Charles V at the court of Henry VIII, show that Henry VII hadn t succeeded in putting the story of Eleanor s marriage to Edward IV  out of remembraunce  on the European mainland. Therefore ongoing work was required for the sake of England s new reigning dynasty. Thomas More also asserted that the king had a love affair with a  Mistress Shore . But, as in the case of Elizabeth Lucy, not a single shred of contemporary evidence exists to show that Edward IV had anything to do with Mistress Shore. Unlike Elizabeth Lucy, however, Mistress Shore definitely did exist. Her maiden name was Elizabeth Lambert. A marriage for her was arranged by her family, and her first husband was called William Shore. Unfortunately, that marriage proved difficult, and the young wife appealed to the church for its annulment. Eventually she married again. Before that, however, she had two love affairs: one with Lord Hastings, and the other with Edward IV s step-son, the Marquis of Dorset. Curiously, a number of sources prove that her first husband, William Shore, was a supporter of Edward IV, and worked with him. However, no contemporary sources ever claim that Mistress Shore had a relationship with the king. Heaps of illegitimate children? The traditional story of Edward IV s private life asserts not only that he had mistresses, but also that he produced heaps of illegitimate children. However, that too proves to be untrue. The king is recorded as only acknowledging one illegitimate child during his reign. It was a boy, but his name is unknown. Previous historians tended to assume that the boy in question was Arthur Wayte/Plantagenet, later Lord Lisle. However, the evidence clearly shows that Arthur was only finally acknowledged as a royal  bastard  many years after the death of his alleged father. So he cannot have been the illegitimate child who was accorded formal recognition by Edward IV himself. Curiously, however, one or two girls also seem to have been recognised as illegitimate daughters of Edward IV years later, during the reign of Henry VII. One possible explanation for this is that Richard III was offered the throne on the assumption that Edward s children by Elizabeth Widville were illegitimate! John Ashdown-Hill states that Richard III, the youngest brother of Edward IV, was offered the throne by the three estates of the realm on the grounds that his elder brother, Edward IV, had committed bigamy. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) The power behind the throne For all the question marks hanging over her marriage to the king, Elizabeth Widville seems to have exercised a great deal of influence over Edward IV. Despite later stories that he had many love affairs, from 1464 until his death in 1483, Edward seems to have been rather fond of his wife. Elizabeth Widville was acknowledged as Edward s legal wife during his reign, and her children were also officially recognised as the heirs to the throne. However, their status was always questioned in some quarters. Even members of the royal family   including the king s own middle brother, George, Duke of Clarence   disputed their claims. One result was that George was imprisoned and executed   apparently on the orders of Elizabeth Widville herself. A contemporary report written by Italian diplomat Domenico Mancini certainly suggests that this was the case. Elizabeth s later conduct confirms that she took a strong role in politics. Following Edward IV s death, with the aid of members of her own family, she attempted a coup to enable herself to act as regent for her young son. But in 15th-century England, regency powers were always assigned to the senior living prince of the blood royal   not to the mother. Thus when Edward IV died, according to English custom, power belonged in the hands of his surviving brother: Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who would, of course, go on to become King Richard III  The late John Ashdown-Hill was a historian and the author of The Private Life of Edward IV (Amberley Publishing, November 2016).

        "title": "Elizabeth I s love life: was she really a  Virgin Queen ?",
        "content": "Over the years, countless books, novels, plays and films have depicted Elizabeth I s relationships with figures such as Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester; Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, and the Duke of Anjou. In the absence of conclusive proof one way or another, the question  did they or didn t they?  will always linger. Yet what is clear is that, both at home and abroad, rumours about Elizabeth s love life   real or imagined   circulated throughout her reign. Far from being the Virgin Queen, for some hostile observers Elizabeth was the  whore  of Europe. Ad Contemporary beliefs about the  insatiable  sexual appetites of women, together with Elizabeth s failure to marry, fuelled suspicions that the queen was engaged in secret sexual liaisons. Her Catholic opponents challenged her virtue, and accused her of a  filthy lust  that had  defiled her body and the country . The king of France joked that one of the great questions of the day was  whether Queen Elizabeth was a maid or no . The courts of Europe were abuzz with gossip as to the queen of England s behaviour. From the very earliest months of her reign, rumours spread of Elizabeth s relationship with Robert Dudley, her  sweet Robin  whom she had known since childhood. Within days of her accession, Elizabeth had appointed Dudley as master of the horse   a position that guaranteed almost daily contact. The Spanish ambassador reported to the king of Spain that  Lord Robert has come so much into favour that he does whatever he likes and it is even said that Her Majesty visits him in his chamber day and night . The pair s attraction to one another was widely commented upon, and their flirtatious behaviour shocked observers. When in 1560 Robert Dudley s wife, Amy Robsart, was found with her neck broken at the bottom of a staircase, speculation was rife as to the involvement of the queen and her favourite. In the years that followed, their close relationship continued, but any lingering possibility of a future marriage was cast aside. Elizabeth s councillors were determined to secure a favourable marriage for her, both as a means of consolidating England s position in Europe and to provide an heir to succeed her. While there was no lack of suitors, including Philip II of Spain; Erik XIV of Sweden and the Archdukes Ferdinand and Charles of Austria, no one managed to win the queen s favour or the unanimous support of her council. While foreign negotiations continued, Elizabeth enjoyed the attention of young male courtiers like Thomas Heneage, Christopher Hatton and Walter Raleigh, and later Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, all of whom flirted their way into the queen s favour. But Robert Dudley remained the queen s first, and probably only love. Perhaps as a reaction to Dudley s marriage to Lettice Devereux, dowager countess of Essex in the autumn of 1578, the following year Elizabeth welcomed Francois, the duke of Anjou, brother of the king of France, to the English court to present his suit for marriage. Robert Dudley, who Elizabeth called her  sweet Robin . (  Heritage Image Partnership Ltd / Alamy) It was not an ideal match. Anjou was a 20-something tiny and pockmarked Catholic who was widely rumoured to be a transvestite. Nonetheless, Elizabeth had always longed to be wooed in person by one of her illustrious suitors, and for a time she seemed to be genuine in her affections and interest in Anjou, whom she affectionately named her  frog . After a few weeks Anjou returned to France and negotiations appeared to falter in the face of public opposition to the match, but in October 1581 Anjou returned to England. Since his previous visit, he had continued to write love letters to the queen in which he expressed his desire to be  kissing and rekissing all that Your beautiful Majesty can think of , as well as to be  in bed between the sheets in your beautiful arms . Upon his arrival in London Elizabeth once again seemed enthralled and enraptured by Anjou s presence, and on 22 November, when the court was assembled at Whitehall to celebrate the Accession Day festivities, Elizabeth declared in public that she intended to marry him. She proceeded to kiss him on the mouth and give him her ring. Yet overnight, Elizabeth apparently had second thoughts and announced the next day she would not marry Anjou.

It is doubtful whether Elizabeth had really intended to go ahead with the marriage given the popular hostility to it, but when Anjou finally departed she made much of being grief-stricken at the loss of her lover  with whom she so unwillingly parted . With the failure of the French match, hopes that Elizabeth would marry came to an end, but as she grew old and increasingly isolated she continued to seek the attention of her male courtiers. Robert Devereux, the young earl of Essex and stepson of Robert Dudley, was Elizabeth s last great flirtation. Despite the age gap between them, the nature of the relationship was again speculated upon. He soon became master of the horse and moved into his stepfather s apartments at court. One of Essex s servants boasted that  even at night my lord is at cards or one game or another with her, that he cometh not to his own lodging till the birds sing in the morning.  But this was a different kind of relationship than the one Elizabeth had had with Dudley, and was more about the desire of an ageing woman to be made to feel young and attractive by a handsome young courtier. Yet Elizabeth was never so swept away by her emotions that she lost a keen sense of political realities. In 1601, after what was seen to be an attempted coup against her, she ordered Essex s execution. In 1603 Elizabeth, then almost 70, died unmarried and celebrated as England s great  Virgin Queen . Yet her death served only to continue speculation about her private life. In the years that followed, the questioning of Elizabeth s virginity was no longer confined to hostile Catholic discourse, and there was a growing sense that Elizabeth s private feelings had compromised the integrity of her rule. In life, Elizabeth and the ladies of the bedchamber had tenaciously defended the chastity of her body to protect her reputation and defend her crown. In death, it is surely the possibility that she was not chaste that continues to fascinate, and ensure Elizabeth s enduring popularity and appeal.

        "title": "Ashurbanipal 'the Great', the Lion of Assyria",
        "content": "The name Ashurbanipal can hardly be counted among the most famous when it comes to ancient leaders. Against the likes of Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra and many others, he may struggle, in the Western world at least, to get picked out of a line up. Ad Even Gareth Brereton, the curator of a British Museum exhibition about him and his often-overlooked Assyrian Empire - I am Ashurbanipal: King of the World, King of Assyria, which ran from late 2018 until early 2019 - says that he is  the greatest king you ve never heard of . In his day, Ashurbanipal was the most powerful person on Earth. As the dominant force in seventh-century-BC Mesopotamia, the crucible of civilisations, he furthered Assyria s reach beyond what had been achieved in the previous two millennia. And he used his power to build a vast library of texts from across his empire   the oldest of its kind surviving   that has bestowed a wealth of knowledge about this ancient world and its peoples. In recent years, the legacy of the Assyrian Empire has been under threat by destruction at the hands of Islamic State. With priceless items and landmarks lost, it is more pressing than ever that Ashurbanipal does not become just another forgotten king. Who was Ashubanipal? For all he did as King of Assyria, the young Ashurbanipal did not expect to take the throne. His father, Esarhaddon, appointed him crown prince in 672 BC following the death of Ashurbanipal s eldest brother. This meant skipping over the older Shamash-shum-ukin, who instead took the lesser title of King of Babylon, a major city state (and former chief power in the region) under Assyrian control. Assyrian palaces were more than residences; they were complexes from which the empire was run (Photo by   Historical Picture Archive/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) Ashurbanipal, whose name means  The god Ashur is creator of an heir , received instruction in kingship, from royal decorum and hunting to administration and training for war. He learned to fight, fire a bow, ride a horse, lead a chariot, and mastered a skill associated for centuries with being an Assyrian warrior king: lion hunting. Slaughtering lions represented a king s ability to protect his people from the dangers of the world, so hunts would be public events.  I pierced the throats of raging lions, each with a single arrow,  Ashurbanipal had written, and in stone reliefs he is seen strangling them with his bare hands. Unusually, Ashurbanipal pursued scholarly pursuits too. He could read and write   in Sumerian, Akkadian and Aramaic   and studied mathematics and the esteemed practice of oil divination. He demonstrated such intelligence and aptitude for leadership that he would assume command of the court when his father travelled. It was on the way to Egypt that Esarhaddon died, leading to Ashurbanipal becoming king in 668 BC. The succession went smoothly, thanks to a treaty imposed on Assyrian subjects compelling their allegiance, and an oath of loyalty forced on the courtiers by his grandmother, Naqi a-Zakutu. He came to the throne with the empire at its height, and continued on the expansionist path of his predecessors. The world's greatest war machine Ashurbanipal brought a swift end to an ongoing war in Egypt by defeating both the Kushites and Nubians, capturing the capital of Memphis and sacking Thebes. Egypt remained under Assyrian control for around a decade, but even when the country achieved independence again, Ashurbanipal felt no need to retaliate. As trade continued, he lost nothing. That peace allowed him to besiege the Phoenician city of Tyre, then turn his attentions to the troublemaking regions of Elam and Urartu. War and quashing rebellions were near-constant features of Ashurbanipal s reign, and while he did not lead soldiers into battle himself, preferring to stay at the capital of Nineveh, his armies conquered all. The eighth-century-BC king Tiglath-Pileser III had reformed the Assyrian army into the world s greatest war machine and, under Ashurbanipal, its infantry, cavalry, chariots and siege expertise saw the empire grow to its largest, reaching from modern-day Turkey to the Persian Gulf. What defined the military campaigns of Ashurbanipal s reign was the utter ruthlessness of both his armies and the punishments he meted out as king. Defeated peoples would be plundered, taxed and deported to the empire, where they were be put to work or inducted into the infantry. Enemy leaders were made an example of. One relief portrays a king with a dog chain through his jaw and being made to live inside a kennel, and another shows the head of an Elamite king hanging from a tree while Ashurbanipal and his wife enjoy a meal.

He followed the policy of previous kings of splitting the empire into provinces or vassal states, each with a governor, and the empire had a reliable network for communication and supplies due to miles of royal roads, like arteries pumping the lifeblood of the empire. And at the heart: Nineveh. Now near Mosul in Iraq, it had been transformed into a city of never-before-seen size and splendour, complete with the so-called  palace without rival , built by Ashurbanipal s grandfather Sennacherib. Located on the bank of the Tigris River, Nineveh boasted spectacular gardens, a permanent oasis in the desert watered by canals and monumental aqueducts. No wonder that some historians today claim Nineveh, not Babylon, as the true home of the Hanging Gardens. It was here that Ashurbanipal ruled, built a new palace and established a centre of society and culture. War and quashing rebellions were near-constant features of Ashurbanipal s reign Some 300 miles to the south on the Euphrates River sat the city of Babylon, where Ashurbanipal s  favourite brother  Shamash-shum-ukin ruled as king. He kept the peace for. 16 years, but tensions between the two brothers borne from when their father overlooked him as heir slowly mounted. Ashurbanipal managed Babylonian affairs and dictated decrees, leaving his brother as nothing more than a puppet. Resentful at his restricted powers, Shamash-shum-ukin eventually formed a coalition with several conquered peoples and rebelled in 652 BC. The resulting war ended in disaster for Shamash-shum-ukin. His allies abandoned him and the Assyrians laid siege to Babylon for two years. Those inside starved   according to one inscription, resorting to eating the  flesh of their sons and daughters    and, with defeat approaching, Shamash-shum-ukin committed suicide by setting his palace ablaze. A remorseless Ashurbanipal set about on his punishment:  The rest of those living I destroyed  and their carved up bodies I fed to dogs, to pigs, to wolves, to eagles, to birds of the heavens, to fishes of the deep.  Ashurbanipal managed Babylonian affairs, leaving his brother as a puppet In the years that followed, Ashurbanipal s wrath fell hardest on Elam. With its people divided by civil war, he saw a chance to rid himself of this defiant enemy. His armies ravaged the lands, salted the ground to prevent anything from growing, plundered palaces and temples, looted royal tombs of their bones, and killed or deported in huge numbers. Read more | He tried to conquer knowledge itself   instead this ancient Mesopotamian king resorted to rule with terror So eager was Ashurbanipal to demonstrate his power that he claimed to have killed a king and his son with his own sword, despite not being at the battle. A more consistent display of his ruthlessness came after sacking the city of Susa in 639 BC, when he had four Elamite leaders draw his chariot in the triumphal procession. He left Elam in ruins, having refused any rebuilding or new governor, and with a severely decreased population. The Assyrian Empire had never been stronger, and at no other time did Ashurbanipal better deserve his self-given moniker,  great king, mighty king, king of the world . Through such names, writings and the reliefs adorning the walls of his palace, he established his image as warrior and conqueror, but also scholar. His ability to read and write made him a rarity among Assyrian kings, so he would be represented with a stylus, as well as a sword, in his belt. Assyrian soldiers escort loot and captives from Babylon in this marble relief. (Photo by Ashmolean Museum/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Texts would be signed with his name, implying he wrote them himself, and he once declared:  All the art of writing of every kind, I made myself master of them all   The best of the scribal art, such works as none of the kings who went before me had ever learnt, remedies from the top of the head to the toenails, non-canonical selections, clever teachings, whatever pertains to the medical mastery of Ninurta and Gala, I wrote on tablets, checked and collated, and deposited within my palace for perusing and reading.  The library of Ashurbanipal Hungry for knowledge, Ashurbanipal began an undertaking the legacy of which would surpass his decades of military victories and territorial expansion   the building of his library. Sometimes called the first modern library in history, it constituted the most complete collection of the world s knowledge at the time. A zealous man, Ashurbanipal hoped the texts would help him better understand the gods, so sought out omens, incantations, prayers, rituals and proverbs. Yet that only made up a fraction of the library. Thousands of texts, mostly written in cuneiform on clay tablets, had been gathered or copied by scholars sent to every corner of the empire. More came in after being looted or when Ashurbanipal threatened conquered nations to send what writings they possessed. Housed at his palace in Nineveh with rooms devoted to a myriad subjects, the tablets covered history, law, geography, medicine, sciences, lexicography, literature, poetry, religion and magic to name a few. Government records would be kept in deeper recesses. When discovered in the mid-19th century, the library revealed its most important treasures, such as a nearly complete list of Assyrian rulers and the Epic of Gilgamesh, regarded as the first great epic work of literature. This includes the famous Flood Tablet, which bears a striking resemblance to the biblical story of the Flood. The excavation also uncovered the Enuma Elish, the Babylonian creation myth. The Library of Ashurbanipal ranks as one of history s most significant archaeological finds. Excavating an empire Relying on religious texts and biased historians from Greece and Rome, understanding of the Assyrians remained scant or suspect until the 19th century. But when French archaeologist Paul- mile Botta discovered the city of Dur-Sharrukin in 1843, others were inspired to seek out the lost empire. English adventurer Austen Henry Layard excavated Nimrud and Nineveh, uncovering a wealth of artefacts, reliefs and colossal stone statues of lamassu. He is also credited with the unearthing of Ashurbanipal s library in 1852, although that was actually the achievement of his Assyrian assistant, Hormuzd Rassam. The finds, and translations of the ancient cuneiform texts by George Smith, caused a sensation. Excavations have continued, on and off, ever since. But when Islamic State held the land near Mosul, Iraq, many priceless treasures were bulldozed, blown up and vandalised. Their cleansing of anything un-Islamic is a reminder of the need to preserve our knowledge of the Assyrian Empire, or risk it being lost forever. Ashurbanipal s library long outlived his empire. In fact, the downfall of the latter helped the precious texts survive. Within two decades of his death c627 BC, the cause of which remains unknown, the Assyrian Empire had collapsed. It had grown too big, with its resources too stretched to remain stable, and the loss of its talismanic leader sparked both civil war and rebellions by a number of vassal states. In 612 BC, Nineveh was besieged and destroyed. When the attackers razed the once-wondrous capital, the burning walls of the palace fell on top of the library, unintentionally baking the clay tablets and preserving them for posterity. Today, the British Museum houses more than 30,000 tablets and fragments of the Library of Ashurbanipal, as well as the iconic 30-tonne stone lamassu (winged bulls with the bearded heads of humans) and the finest examples of reliefs from Assyrian palace walls. And while its exhibition may not make Ashurbanipal as famous as other ancient personalities, it brings together more than 200 artefacts to tell the story of an empire and its last great king, as well as the struggles archaeologists face with saving sites under threat. The Neo-Assyrian Empire Ashurbanipal was the last great king of one of history s first empires, its roots stretching back nearly 2,000 years before his time. In the 14th century BC, the millenniumold state of Assyria, once the powerhouse in Mesopotamia, broke the dominion of the neighbouring Mitanni kingdom and launched campaigns of conquest. Assyria flourished, for a while. It lost much of its territory in the 12th century BC   the cause remains a mystery   before a line of powerful kings restored their lands and influence, establishing what is called the Neo-Assyrian Empire. They subdued enemies, including Babylon and Egypt, due to innovations in battle. They were among the first to utilise iron, and deployed superior tactics. Soldiers fought in pairs   one to fire a bow while the other held a body-sized shield   and mastered siege warfare. What s more, they were utterly ruthless. The words  destroyed ,  devastated  and  burned with fire  appeared often in the inscriptions of kings. Yet they were efficient administrators too. They built far-reaching infrastructure, such as royal roads, and cities like Ashur, Nimrud and Nineveh. Although their power collapsed in the seventh century BC, the Assyrians helped draw the blueprint for every empire that followed.

It s one of history s most, well, burning questions, and with good reason the library was one of history s most important institutions in education and culture. Despite being the pride of the ancient world, the famous Egyptian library burned multiple times, and in 48 B.C., found itself in the crosshairs of a civil war. Did Julius Caesar really burn down the Great Library of Alexandria? Or was it Islamic scholars? Or the library s patron himself? Here are all the leads historians have about the library s destruction. What was the Library of Alexandria? Despite its location in Egypt, the library was actually a bastion of ancient Greek culture. Built inside a temple known as the Mouseion, or Temple of the Muses, the museum and its reading rooms and gardens no longer exist.

        "content": "Analysis of the paintings inside the tomb suggests that two teams of artists carried out the work.The most skilled one worked on the left side of the tomb, and the other worked on the right. First, the rock walls were covered with plaster, and onto this outlines of the figures were traced with red paint and then corrected with black paint.Next came the artisans, who carved reliefs into the plaster following the painted outlines. Finally, the painters brought to life the walls and ceilings through the use of color. Over time, some layers of stucco that had been applied too thickly began to peel and fall off under their own weight. Remarkably, the damage was relatively minor and the paintings, now restored, provide a unique artistic insight into how the inhabitants of pharaonic Egypt understood death and the afterlife. (How a single battle and one young pharaoh turned Egypt into a superpower) Nefertari s journey to the afterlife The artistic conventions of the day are reflected in how the tomb was painted. Royal tombs were conceived as a microcosm, a world in themselves. The ceilings symbolized the sky, and the floor was the earth the deceased would become a part of. The burial chamber where the sarcophagus of the deceased king or queen was placed represented the kingdom of Osiris, the god of the underworld. It was believed Osiris presided over the tribunal that judged the soul, determining whether the person had been righteous enough to pass into immortality. PRIESTS One of the two sem, or funerary, priests is dressed in leopard s skin and wears a side braid, indicating his youth. The priests received the queen and were in charge of the funeral rites. S. VANNINI/ALBUM If the judgment was favorable, the deceased began their ascent to rebirth with the sun god, Re. This transition involved a challenging journey during which the soul had to demonstrate certain knowledge and make offerings to the divine beings. The phases of this passage were detailed in the Book of the Dead. Nefertari s tomb was decorated and designed to help her on this journey, guiding the queen toward a full and happy life beyond death. The underground world of Osiris Nefertari s funeral ends with the transfer of her mummy to the burial chamber. This is symbolically the domain of Osiris, the god who embodies royal figures after death while simultaneously judging whether or not they are fit to enjoy immortality. Images of Osiris decorate the four pillars that support the room: On each pillar, he appears in human form and in symbolic form as the djed symbol. The mummy of Nefertari is put inside a large pink granite sarcophagus of which the lid, although broken, has been preserved. This sarcophagus is placed in the lower area of the room, which symbolizes the primordial earth, the origin of the world, and all that is in it.",

        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK). This journey back in time starts in southern Alberta, two hours east of Calgary, where the ground cracks open to reveal a prehistoric archive dating back some 76 million years. Here, the rolling prairie collapses into wrinkled valleys carved out by ancient glaciers, banded in orange and grey layers like the pages of a medieval book and punctuated by bizarre  hoodoos    pillars of rock wearing jaunty sandstone hats. These are Canada s Badlands   so-called because early French fur traders found them inhospitable and difficult to cross. In this treeless desert, only the hardiest vegetation survives: yellow buffalo bean flowers and tiny pincushion cacti sprout between gullies, and the aroma of sagebrush hangs on the breeze. This area may have been bad for the settlers, but it s a goldmine for palaeontologists. The scientific motherlode lies in Dinosaur Provincial Park, a 29-square-mile UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the richest fossil locations on Earth. Visitors can explore a wealth of fossils while walking along the public trails of Dinosaur Provincial Park. Photograph by Bella Falk  These layers date to between 76 and 74 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous period,  reveals geologist Jessica Glombick, the park s visitor experience team leader.  People have been searching for fossils here since the early 1900s, though of course the local Indigenous people knew about them long before that.  Close to 50 dinosaur species have been found here, including Albertosaurus, a formidable predator related to Tyrannosaurus rex, and Corythosaurus, a crested herbivore whose near-complete skeleton was unearthed after a park ranger spotted a bone poking out of a cliff. These were found alongside fossils of prehistoric turtle shells and crocodile teeth, revealing a thriving, complex ecosystem. Visitors can explore public trails and museum displays, but to see these ancient monsters up close, it s best to join a guided hike into the park s protected zone, where fossils lie strewn like shattered pottery, and you may come across a hadrosaur leg bone or ankylosaur rib lying on the ground like driftwood washed up on a beach. Walking around requires concentration: there are so many fragments, it s almost impossible not to step on something. The best discoveries end up at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, two hours north in Drumheller. This small town of about 8,000 inhabitants is known as the  Dinosaur Capital of the World , a tag worn with pride. A gold dinosaur roars on the sign, there are dinosaur models on every street and the world s largest model dinosaur, an 86ft T-rex named Tyra, towers over the town centre. But these are mere warm-ups for the headline act. As one of the world s top dinosaur museums, the Royal Tyrrell houses more than 170,000 specimens covering almost the entire history of evolution, from weird, 500-million-year-old worms found in the Canadian Rockies to a woolly mammoth and sabre-toothed cat from the last Ice Age. As one of the world s top dinosaur museums, the Royal Tyrrell houses more than 170,000 specimens covering almost the entire history of evolution. Photograph by Bella Falk In the Breakthroughs gallery, visitors encounter Alberta s latest discoveries. An Ornithomimus   like a prehistoric ostrich   provides the first evidence that North American dinosaurs had beaks and feathers. In the next display, still resting in the plaster jacket in which it was lifted out of the ground, is Borealopelta, the world s best-preserved armoured dinosaur, every scale on its bony armour and even its stomach contents set in stone. The showstopping finale is the Dinosaur Hall, where more than 30 mounted skeletons roar, fight or amble in frozen motion. A Tyrannosaurus rex looms over the room, its open jaws frozen mid-snarl. Nearby, the armour-plated herbivore Euoplocephalus, its back studded with bony knobs and its tail ending in a heavy club, squares up to the predator Gorgosaurus, while a long-necked Camptosaurus struggles for life in the jaws of an Allosaurus, their bones locked in an eternal battle to the death. But for anyone who wants to get even closer to prehistory, the active palaeontological coalface can be found near the city of Grande Prairie   a short flight from Calgary or a 4.5-hour drive from either Jasper or Edmonton. Here, the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum oversees one of the most exciting active fossil sites in the world: the Pipestone Creek bone bed. Nicknamed the  River of Death , this dense deposit contains the jumbled remains of a herd of Pachyrhinosaurus, powerful herbivores that looked a bit like modern-day rhinos, but with a huge frill on the back of their heads and a bony lump on their noses instead of a horn.  We believe there may have been as many as 10,000 individuals migrating through this area,  explains curator Dr Emily Bamforth.  But about 72 million years ago, they drowned in a catastrophic flood. Later, a second flood mixed up all the bones, creating a huge Pachyrhinosaurus puzzle.  The Pipestone Creek bone bed is nicknamed the  River of Death  due to the dense concentration of fossils. Photograph by Bella Falk The team now has the laborious task of separating the confusion of fossils from the solid rock, although the museum s Palaeontologist for a Day experience lets amateurs join the work. A rattling bus journey along an unsealed track, followed by a short walk through a forest of poplars and spruce, brings you to the bone bed, where a tarpaulin is peeled back to reveal a dark patch of rock, ridged and furrowed by shapes in the stone.  That s a rib,  points Emily.  That s part of the frill. That s a toe bone. We have about 100-200 fossils per square foot here and they re all interlocked. We may never know if this is one animal or 10.  Using an awl and rock hammer, guests help chip away at the surrounding matrix, careful not to damage anything precious. It s not a job for the impatient, but the potential payoff is priceless: the chance to help uncover real dinosaurs that have been buried for millions of years, or even to discover something brand new. And it does happen   last year, the team dug up one of the largest Pachyrhinosaurus skulls ever found. Nicknamed  Big Sam , he s now undergoing a thorough clean-up in the museum s lab, and guests can watch as technicians coax his broad snout from the stone after millions of years underground. What makes Alberta s dinosaur country so exceptional isn t just the quantity of fossils, but the fact that they re still being discovered. There s a real thrill in walking across the same landscape once trodden by dinosaurs, touching the remains of a 75-million-year-old monster or watching a rib emerge under a palaeontologist s tool. And all of it far away from the excitable school tour groups and theme park rides of most other dinosaur attractions.",

        "title": "The Amazing Dinosaur Found (Accidentally) by Miners in Canada",
        "content": "Nearly six years later, I m visiting the fossil prep lab at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in the windswept badlands of Alberta. The cavernous warehouse swells with the hum of ventilation and the buzz of technicians scraping rock from bone with needle-tipped tools resembling miniature jackhammers. But my focus rests on a 2,500-pound mass of stone in the corner. At first glance the reassembled gray blocks look like a nine-foot-long sculpture of a dinosaur. A bony mosaic of armor coats its neck and back, and gray circles outline individual scales. Its neck gracefully curves to the left, as if reaching toward some tasty plant. But this is no lifelike sculpture. It s an actual dinosaur, petrified from the snout to the hips. 0:34 The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes. Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal s skull. Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward. I can count the scales on its sole. Caleb Brown, a postdoctoral researcher at the museum, grins at my astonishment.  We don t just have a skeleton,  he tells me later.  We have a dinosaur as it would have been.  For paleontologists the dinosaur s amazing level of fossilization caused by its rapid undersea burial is as rare as winning the lottery. Usually just the bones and teeth are preserved, and only rarely do minerals replace soft tissues before they rot away. There s also no guarantee that a fossil will keep its true-to-life shape. Feathered dinosaurs found in China, for example, were squished flat, and North America s  mummified  duck-billed dinosaurs, among the most complete ever found, look withered and sun dried. During its burial at sea, the nodosaur settled onto its back, pressing the dinosaur s skeleton into the armor and embossing it with the outlines of some bones. One ripple in the armor traces the animal s right shoulder blade. Paleobiologist Jakob Vinther, an expert on animal coloration from the U.K. s University of Bristol, has studied some of the world s best fossils for signs of the pigment melanin. But after four days of working on this one delicately scraping off samples smaller than flecks of grated Parmesan even he is astounded. The dinosaur is so well preserved that it  might have been walking around a couple of weeks ago,  Vinther says.  I ve never seen anything like this.  A poster for the movie Night at the Museum hangs on the wall behind Vinther. On it a dinosaur skeleton emerges from the shadows, magically brought back to life. The remarkable fossil is a newfound species (and genus) of nodosaur, a type of ankylosaur often overshadowed by its cereal box famous cousins in the subgroup Ankylosauridae. Unlike ankylosaurs, nodosaurs had no shin-splitting tail clubs, but they too wielded thorny armor to deter predators. As it lumbered across the landscape between 110 million and 112 million years ago, almost midway through the Cretaceous period, the 18-foot-long, nearly 3,000-pound behemoth was the rhinoceros of its day, a grumpy herbivore that largely kept to itself. And if something did come calling perhaps the fearsome Acrocanthosaurus the nodosaur had just the trick: two 20-inch-long spikes jutting out of its shoulders like a misplaced pair of bull s horns.",

        "content": "(How to dig up 55 tons of dinosaur bones in the world's fiercest desert) Up until now, the prehistoric timeline has been set by the rocks in which fossils are buried. When ancient volcanoes belched out molten rock and ash, for example, the outpourings of the eruptions contained radioactive minerals like uranium. Uranium turns to lead at a constant rate over time, what is sometimes referred to as its half-life, and for decades geologists have been able to look at the ratio of uranium to lead in a rock sample to calculate just how long ago that rock must have formed. Exposed dinosaur eggshell fragments at Teel Ulaan Chaltsai, Eastern Gobi Basin. A new dating method could help paleontologists more accurately understand prehistoric ecosystems and timelines. Lindsay Zanno The problem for paleontologists is that many fossils are found in sediments that lack these radioactive timekeepers. When an expert says a dinosaur is about 75 million years old, that usually means that their fossil was found in a rock layer in close association with a rock layer that contained something like an ash bed that could be dated correctly. Or that a fossil resembles another fossil found in such association with an ash layer. If a dinosaur fossil wasn t found in a rock layer full of ash or solidified volcanic rocks, paleontologists could only roughly estimate the fossil s age. The famous, well-preserved fossils of Mongolia s Gobi Basin dinosaurs such as the famous Velociraptor fall into this category, their true age uncertain without a direct way to tell geologic time.  There are important dinosaur sites in North America and Asia that preserve eggshells and bones but these haven t been accurately dated due to lack of ash layers,  says University of Calgary paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, who was not involved in the new study. Though she cautions that  dinosaur eggshells aren t found very often,  she notes that with uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating,  when they are [found], they could help us figure out the age of fossil sites, especially in places that don t have volcanic ash layers.

        "content": "South African anatomy student Josphine Salmons noticed the skull in late 1924 at the home of her friend Pat Izod, son of the director of the Rand Minds Limited company. She showed it to Raymond Dart, her professor at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who had encouraged his students to bring in any interesting fossil relics. (\"Lucy's Baby\" a Born Climber, Hinting Human Ancestors Lingered in Trees) Dart was interested in amassing a collection of fossils at the university. Having brushed up against anatomists working on fossil human ancestors while studying in London, Dart was particularly excited by this primate skull because it of where it was found. The presence of such a relative in South Africa meant, Dart thought, that a  tolerably complete story  of primate evolution could  yet be wrest from our rocks.  So he turned his attention to the location of the skull s discovery, a mine near the village of Taungs, South Africa. Wondering if any other interesting fossils might emerge, Dart asked the mine manager to collect further specimens. As luck would have it, within weeks, quarry workers stumbled upon another skull that then made its way into Dart s hands. This 2.4-million-year-old skull (shown here with its champion Raymond Dart) upended the study of human origins despite initial rejection by the scientific community. The photograph of Raymond Dart forms part of the Wits University Archives and is published with kind permission of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in South Africa. Photograph provided by Wits University Archives This skull was partially encased in limestone, but Dart carefully freed it using his wife s sharpened knitting needles to extract it. What emerged was a strikingly human-looking individual. It was the complete face and jaw of a small child, along with a natural cast of the brain cavity. The endocast perfectly preserved the brain s shape on one side, while the other side was covered in  picturesque,  sparkling rock crystals. (Where in Africa is the birthplace of human kind?)",

The bones were uncovered by limestone quarry workers digging in Germany s Neander Valley in 1856. At first, they thought they d uncovered the remains of a bear.

His mind is still on the Neanderthals  demise, which he chooses not to attribute primarily to a changing climate or demographic weakness. Homo sapiens caused Neanderthals to  vanish almost instantaneously from the annals of archaeology,  Slimak says. There s no need to deny our colonialist guilt, he says, or to seek solace in the strands of Neanderthal DNA that live on inside us. Even after half a million years on the planet, the Neanderthals  creativity and isolation didn t stand a chance against Homo sapiens  hyperefficiency and social networking. This was, he has said,  a fully fledged conquest.  Back in a rice field in northeastern Laos, Eric Suzzoni is leading Fabrice Demeter s team of scientists toward a new cave several miles north of their base camp. For the past two decades, the international team has worked on a single mountain, excavating a cluster of caves that has yielded a rare trifecta of ancient human species: In addition to discovering the Denisovan molar, the team has unearthed fossils of ancient Homo sapiens in one cave and, in another, a 130,000-year-old tooth most likely from Homo erectus.  That is an incredible result, but we re also looking at just one site,  says Laura Shackelford, an American paleoanthropologist with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a National Geographic Explorer who began working with the team in Laos in 2008. Denisovan remains  have to be all over the place, and we just haven t found them yet.  The future of the distant past seems to lie in Asia, a region that Demeter calls  a blank slate compared to Europe.  It started with the astonishing discovery of two diminutive  hobbit  populations Homo floresiensis in Indonesia in 2003 and Homo luzonensis in the Philippines in 2019. But the focus has now shifted to China. Ever since the Xiahe mandible was identified in 2019, Chinese paleoanthropologists have raced to reexamine the country s vast fossil collections dusting off their  cold cases to see if they too might contain Denisovan relics. Two archaic jawbones one dug up west of Beijing, the other dredged from the Taiwan Strait are close physical matches with the mandible. If their identity is confirmed, as expected, it will mean that Denisovans ranged over all of mainland Asia perhaps centering on what is now Chinese territory. 1:21 Chinese researchers have begun to reshape long-standing assumptions about when we branched off from our fellow hominins. A recent phylogenetic study of one Chinese skull pushed back our divergence from Neanderthals and Denisovans by 300,000 years, shaking long-held beliefs about whether our common ancestor even lived in Africa. Then there s the Harbin skull. Found in 1933 by a worker in northeastern China and hidden in a well for the rest of the 20th century, the 146,000-year-old fossil could belong to a hominin relative closer to modern humans than either Neanderthals or Denisovans a tantalizing clue that inches us nearer to the identity of our common ancestor. Some scientists think the Harbin skull could represent a branch of the Denisovan family or even a completely different lineage. Local paleoanthropologists gave the lineage a distinctly Chinese label: Homo longi, or Dragon Man. (The Harbin skull was the basis for the model constructed by paleoartist John Gurche.)",

Mumler hadn t properly cleaned the photographic plate before using it again, leaving a remnant of Green s image behind. But Mumler a technological whiz and amateur chemist who had already racked up a variety of patents soon realized he could make a lot of money offering ghost photographs of the deceased for $10 a sitting (more than $300 today). It was a fertile time for photography and the paranormal to collide. The first-ever photograph had been taken around 1827, of a French rooftop. A decade later, the first humans were captured in pictures. The public was captivated by this new technology s ability to show realities few had ever seen, from distant countries to wildlife and nature. At the same time, scientific discoveries like the X-ray were proving that the human eye couldn t see everything. (Visit the most haunted sites in Charleston) This print is from one of the first radiographs made by the German physicist Wilhelm Konrad R ntgen (1845-1923), who discovered the electro-magnetic rays he named \"x-rays\" in W rzburg in November 1895. X-rays primed the public for believing in things that the naked eye could not see. Wilhelm Conrad R ntgen, Welcome Collection Meanwhile, in the late 1840s, three sisters had sparked a religious fervor in a small town in upstate New York. Claiming to communicate with ghosts via strange tapping noises coming from the walls of their farmhouse, the Fox sisters became a national obsession. The public had also recently been introduced to long-distance communication in the form of the telegraph. It wasn t that far-fetched, writes Peter Manseau in his book The Apparitionists, that mediums might stretch that communication into another plane entirely: the spirit world. Spiritualism, a religious movement connecting the realms of the living and the dead, was born. Over the next few years, scientific challenges to Spiritualism arose but then the Civil War plunged the nation into a state of fear, grief, and mourning. By the time Mumler was passing around his unique photograph, the country was already a year into the conflict. Photography had become a way for families to memorialize their loved ones. Mothers had portraits taken of their sons before they left for battle, and soldiers carried photos of their families to the frontlines. Back in Boston, Mumler began experimenting in the dark room with double exposures and other tricks to give the appearance of spirit visitors. Pensive children, concerned parents, and loving husbands surfaced, often appearing to embrace the living. The appetite for spirit photography was limitless in the bereaved nation.",

Hood was seriously wounded early on, and Brig. Gen. Evander Law took charge, leaving no brigade commander to direct the crucial attack on Vincent s men guarding Little Round Top.  Hold this ground at all costs!  Vincent told Col. Joshua Chamberlain, whose 20th Maine Infantry occupied the very end of the Union line. After withstanding repeated assaults by the 15th Alabama Infantry, Chamberlain s men scattered their foes with a bayonet charge. Heavy fighting continued elsewhere until Brig. Gen. Stephen Weed came to the aid of the mortally wounded Vincent and secured Little Round Top for the Union at the cost of his own life. July 2, 1863: War in the Wheat Field The battle raged in the Wheat Field, where Sickles s beleaguered Third Corps buckled under pressure from brigades led by Col. George  Tige  Anderson of Hood s division and Brig. Gens. Paul Semmes and Joseph Kershaw of McLaws s division. To hold the line, Meade reinforced the Third Corps with men led by Brig. Gens. James Barnes and John Caldwell. Barnes went in first but found Kershaw on his flank and pulled his forces back, obstructing Brig. Gen. Samuel Zook of Caldwell s advancing division.  If you can t get out of the way,  Zook shouted,  lie down, and we will march over you!  Passing through, Zook s troops entered the Wheat Field alongside the Irish Brigade of Col. Patrick Kelly. Attack on Meade's left A map by Robert Knox Sneden depicts John Bell Hood s troops approaching Little Round Top while others fought across Plum Run and through Devil s Den, grappling with troops led by Hobart Ward, holding the left flank of Daniel Sickles s Third Corps. After the attack began, John Sedgwick s trailing Sixth Corps arrived from the south, buttressing Meade s left as fighting spread northward to the Wheat Field and Peach Orchard and as Federals on Culp s and Cemetery Hills came under attack by Ewell s corps. Virginia Historical Society A third brigade under Col. Edward Cross joined in a bloody assault that left Cross and Zook mortally wounded but drove the Rebels into Rose s Woods. Around 6:30 p.m., Brig. Gens. William Barksdale and William Wofford of McLaws s division delivered a staggering blow at the Peach Orchard. Pouring through the gap left by the collapse of Brig. Gen. Charles Graham s brigade, Wofford s troop of Georgians drove Federals back while Barksdale s Mississippians routed the remainder of Brig. Gen. Andrew Humphrey s division along Emmitsburg Road. The tide turned when Sickles fell wounded near the Trostle House, and Hancock of the Second Corps took command. He restored order by rallying retreating units on Cemetery Ridge and bolstering them with reinforcements. After sending a brigade led by Col. George Willard to repulse Barksdale, Hancock beat back a charge led by Brig. Gen. Cadmus Wilcox, and Lee s furious attack ended in a stalemate. (Reconstruction offered a glimpse of equality for Black Americans. Why did it fail?) July 3, 1863: Pickett's Charge After two days of fighting, Lee did not give up. He ruled out another attack on Meade s left, which had been heavily reinforced. Prospects for success looked little better on Meade s right, where Confederates in Ewell s division had advanced late on July 2, breaking through at Cemetery Hill before being repulsed there, as they were at Culp s Hill. Further attacks by Ewell stood to prevent Meade from shifting forces from his right to bolster his center, along Cemetery Ridge, where Lee hoped for a decisive breakthrough. That meant advancing across open ground into the teeth of Union defenses a perilous charge entrusted to George Pickett s fresh division of 6,000 Virginians, with Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew s division advancing to their north and others following. Confederate high-water mark Pickett s Charge reaches a climax as Federals beat back surging Confederates in a painting by Peter Frederick Rothermel, who drew on eyewitness accounts. State Museum of Pennsylvania Lee s plan went awry early on July 3, when Federals attacked Culp s Hill, triggering a battle that ended inconclusively before Pickett was ready to advance. Lee still had hope that a massive artillery bombardment would impair Meade s defenses on Cemetery Ridge. At 1 p.m., Rebel gunners opened fire. For all the sound and fury, little damage was done. Many Confederate gunners overshot their targets, while Federal artillerymen limited their counterfire to conserve ammunition. When the guns fell silent, Longstreet, who had argued against the attack, signaled reluctantly for the infantry to advance.  This is a desperate thing to attempt,  said Brig. Gen. Richard Garnett of Pickett s division.  It is,  replied Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead, whose brigade followed Garnett s.  But the issue is with the Almighty, and we must leave it in his hands.  To close up with Pettigrew s division to the north, Pickett s men had to march obliquely to their left, which exposed them to deadly flanking fire. Hardest hit were Brig. Gen. James Kemper s men, who went down in droves when Vermonters led by 8 Brig. Gen. George Stannard enveloped their right flank.  Great masses of men seemed to disappear in a moment,  wrote Col. Wheelock Veazey of the 16th Vermont Infantry. All along the line, Confederate ranks crumbled under the searing impact of artillery and infantry fire. Against all odds, Armistead led a few hundred followers over the stone wall at the Angle, where the Federal line jutted forward slightly, but they were soon overpowered in hand-to-hand fighting. As Lee s battered forces withdrew, hopes for the Confederate cause receded with them.",
